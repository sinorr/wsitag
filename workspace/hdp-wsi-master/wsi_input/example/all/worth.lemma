It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
Deputy Wang Yumei , 26-year-old " king breeder of rabbits " and general manager of the Jinan Lushe Rabbit Breeding Corporation , expressed a compassion of innocence in her remarks : " Without the party 's policy on encouraging the people to attain prosperity and the relaxed environment that encourages the development of various economic undertakings under different types of ownership , it would be impossible for me to transform , within 10 years , a small breeding farm with a few workers into a corporation whose current assets are worth 56 million yuan . "  
This is a historical event in the north-south relations since the split on the Korean Peninsula 55 years ago .  As a new bright spot for the south and the north to head toward peace , reconciliation and cooperation , the meeting is welcome and worth being supported .  
There are indeed many new terminologies and new practices .  At a relevant experience-exchange meeting , a general said something with deep meaning : Our units are bent on creating new things and reform , and this is worth advocating .  However , we must keep firmly in mind one thing - - that is , no matter what reform we are carrying out , we must not deviate from our principal aim , the party 's absolute leadership over the army must not change , and our army 's fine traditions must not change .  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .  
It is worth mentioning that the Fifth " Five-Year Plan " period was timed with the Third " Five-Year " campaign launched in China to spread legal knowledge among the citizens , which was held in the course of China 's building a socialist market economic system and under the great backdrop of the party putting forward , at the 15th CPC national congress , the proposal of administering the country according to laws and of building China into a socialist country that is ruled by laws .  
A senior US official disclosed that apart from destroyers and submarines , the Bush administration is set to sell Taiwan a dozen " P-3 " anti-submarine aircraft equipped with missiles and torpedoes and some mechanized artillery .  These weapons are worth at least an estimated US $ 4-billion .  
Regardless of the strong protest of the Chinese Government , the US Government announced on 23 April its decision to sell Taiwan several billion US dollars ' worth of advanced weapons , including " Kidd-class " destroyers , diesel-power submarines , and P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft .  This move taken by the US government is a flagrant breach of the principles stated in the three Sino-US joint communiques that the US Government has repeatedly committed itself to ;  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
In particular , on 24 April , heedless of China 's solemn representations , the US Government openly announced the sale to Taiwan of a large quantity of advanced offensive weapons and equipment worth $ 4-billion , including four Kidd-class missile destroyers , eight diesel submarines , and 12 antisubmarine helicopters , which was the largest US arms sale to Taiwan since Bush Sr . sold them 150-F-16 fighters in 1992 .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
To prove that all this is not non-existent , the US Department of Defense recently also announced that it would provide Taiwan a " joint tactical information transmission system " worth $ 725-million and transform Taiwan 's " joint operation command center of the three armed services " and the operation command centers of various types of units , so that the United States and Taiwan could be linked through identical operation command systems .  
When elucidating the human rights situation of the motherland of China , it is very correct to emphasize that the right to survive is fundamental .  However , explaining " democracy and human rights " to the Taiwan compatriots is even more complicated , and is also very difficult to manage .  But , this is possibly much more powerful than guided missiles , so it is worth striving to try to do .  
The party 's ideological and political work , which has become even more arduous and difficult under the increasingly complicated circumstances , is by no means dispensable or fruitless ; rather , it is indispensable and well worth doing . 
If the Chinese macroeconomic regulation and control departments ' recommendation of issuing additional treasury bonds is approved by the State Council and adopted by the National People 's Congress , it will be the third time running for the Chinese Government to issue additional treasury bonds in the second half year following the issuance of 100 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of 1998 and 60 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of last year .  
Since the proactive fiscal policy was put into practice in the second half of 1998 , the Chinese Government has cumulatively issued around 270 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds and the funds raised through the bonds have mainly been used for infrastructure construction , technological transformation , environmental protection and ecological projects , and the construction of educational and cultural facilities .  
In light of the new situation of economic operations in 1999 , the central authorities continued to implement the proactive fiscal policy and , on the basis of the planned long-term treasury bond issue worth 50 billion yuan , further issued 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds . 
This year additional treasury bonds worth 100 billion yuan were issued and listed in the budget at the start of the year .  While further accelerating infrastructure construction , the central authorities have intensified business technological renovation ; promoted technological advance and industrial upgrades ;  
2 .  On the other hand , an unprecedented great mass fervor in visiting the mainland and conducting cross-strait exchanges has arisen among Taiwan 's political parties , nongovernmental organizations , and representatives of popular will .  This is something really worth welcoming and really heartening because the people on both sides are the forces that will ultimately decide the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .  
On the morning of 17 August , Chen Shui-bian voluntarily mentioned the above question at a press conference more than ten thousand li from home .  However , he noted he has not made a final decision .  He then changed the subject , talked about the trend of cross-strait relations , and put forward his idea that it is worth further exploring [ tan tao ] on the question of whether the national unification program must be based on the sole and final option of unification .  
The experience the academy has gained in this respect has inherited the glorious tradition of the ideological and political work of the party and PLA , reflects the specific situation and characteristics of the new period , and is marked by innovations and improvements .  It is not only useful to military schools , but also worth drawing on by ordinary institutions of higher learning in various localities .  
He bought off many Customs officials and local leaders in many northern China cities , smuggled large amounts of oil , many cars , and steel products into China worth nearly 10 billion yuan .  He formed a north-south smuggling chain with smuggling king Lai Changxing that led people to say at one time : " We have Lai Changxing in the south , and you have Yao Zhisheng in the north . "  
These reporters learned from the news conference held today by the Information Office of the State Council that the immigration of the people in the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Project has proceeded smoothly .

and commercial housing .  In 1999 and 2000 , the state separately issued another 110 billion yuan 's and 150 billion yuan 's worth of long-term construction bonds , and while making arrangements to continue the state bond-funded projects already under construction , some new projects were added .  They included some technological transformation projects in key trades and industries , the installation of Chinese-made equipment in major projects and the industrialization of advanced technologies , some environmental and ecological construction projects , and some educational infrastructure projects .  
Since 1998 , the state has issued a total of 360 billion yuan 's worth of long-term construction treasury bonds .  They have directly spurred local , departmental , and enterprise matching fund input and bank loans worth approximately 750 billion yuan , and together they have played an important role in promoting economic development .  
They colluded with Huang Guolin , a dismissed worker of customs , smuggled goods valued at more than $ 88 million , and evaded a tax worth more than 17.6 million yuan .  The judgement was : Fu Zhijian and Huang Guolin committed a crime of smuggling ordinary goods ; they were sentenced to death , and deprived of political rights for life , with their personal property confiscated and turned over to the national treasury .  
By contrast , the mainland China developed most of its military weapons by itself .  During the same period , it purchased a total of $ 2.59 billion worth of regular weapons from around the world , ranking 14th in the world .  The key country where the mainland China purchased its weapons from was Russia , from which $ 2.12 billion worth of weapons were imported .  
Through self-investigation and self-correction , leading cadres at all levels of the entire taxation departments turned over to state treasury gifts certificates and negotiable securities worth a total of 7.638 million yuan , 5,177 pieces of gifts worth 2.64 million yuan , and cancelled 186 capital construction projects which saved 360 million yuan state fund .  
This issue must be stressed here because this is the fundamental purpose of our economic development and also the basic requirement of the cardinal principles pursued by our party and government .  Under the current situation , this is also an issue worth special attention .  
Customs officers this ( Friday ) morning foiled an attempt to smuggle 150,000 video compact discs ( VCDs ) to the Mainland via Lok Ma Chau Control Point by using a secret compartment specially built for smuggling purpose .

As a result , they seized 10,553 counterfeit batteries and 12,328 accessories , totally worth $ 2.17 million .  
In the race into the knowledge economy , Mr Tung expected that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as knowledge , brain power , or innovative human capital , was worth more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge economy . 
A joint operation mounted today ( Thursday ) have led to the seizure of about $ 280 000 worth of suspected obscene video compact discs ( VCDs ) and digital video discs ( DVDs ) in Mong Kok . A total of about 8,500 VCDs and 50 DVDs were seized during the raid jointly organised by Police , Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority ( TELA ) and Customs and Excise Department ( C &amp; amp ; E ) .  
I was overjoyed , elated , excited , enthusiastic , but most of all proud , very proud , firstly because I had been appointed to this prestigious position and also because the Force had presented me with an invaluable opportunity , a once-in-a-lifetime chance for this individual to prove both his worth and potential . "  
In addition to some cash and burglary tools , the seizure included ginseng , herbal medicine , dried seafood , gold and jade ornaments , cellular phones , computer parts , video and audio equipment and radio scanner worth about $ 1 million .  
It also encompasses works of art in various media and genres , such as traditional Chinese paintings , oil paintings , prints , watercolours and gouaches , lacquer paintings , illustrations and comics , sculptures .  It is worth noting that the design discipline such as works from the fields of graphic , product , fashion and interior design is also included for the first time .  This innovative attempt to cross the traditional barriers is a proof of China 's striding into a new century .  
The CCB officers also recovered a large quantity of goods worth about $ 150,000 in the 43-year-old man 's private car parked in Dragon Road , North Point , and his home in Tseung Kwan O . The goods suspected to have been purchased with the counterfeit credit cards included clothes and accessories , handbags , jewellery , cosmetics , electronic products , cigarettes and dried seafood .

Agricultural aid of the government has totaled NT $ 2,500 million in the last two and a half years . Another NT $ 1,480 million has been loaned to farmers for modernization projects . With agriculture booming , public and private institutions have been encouraged to provide another NT $ 2,100 million worth of investment in the rural economy .  
At a time when foreign currency reserves were low , the purchase of U . S . $ 2,000 worth of fruit trees seemed wasteful . Chiang Ching-kuo reassured Sung that money spent on scientific research was never a waste .  
I always find that our literary works are lenient and tolerant toward the individual , yet harsh and demanding toward society and the greater environment . This is a problem worth pondering and one I want to ask each of you to think about today .  
On the level of Chinese history , it was the main stage of expansion of the Han Chinese to Taiwan and it worth exploring for the light it can shed on the process of development , on relations between the Han Chinese and the aborigines , and on the history of the Cheng clan . And from the viewpoint of world history , it offers a fresh and vivid approach to seventeenth century maritime trade and international relations . "  
Chou Mi-mi director of the Revival Youth Yueh Drama Troupe , explains that the performance style of Yueh drama incorporates the best elements of Peking opera , spoken drama and folk opera . With attractive melodies and an easy to understand vernacular text , it is ideal for people of all ages and well worth preserving as a valuable example of regional opera . " I hope that the government will do more to extend a helping hand to traditional folk opera and so keep its legacy alive , " says enthusiastic proponent Chou Mi-mi . (  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold . But the ban on new development caused reluctance to proceed without construction of public works . Disordered , illegal constructions and dilapidated old red brick structures with leaky roofs are everywhere .  
The pestle music of the Bunun , which is played before the rice harvest , was originally intended to attract people from neighboring villages to come and share in the crop . Rice is n't planted much any more , but the performance still shows the tribe 's solidarity and generous spirit of sharing , qualities worth cherishing by indigenous people and outsiders alike .  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns . You can see from this that as far as Taiwan 's children 's books are concerned , there is not far to go in terms of raising quality .  
A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior . Besides , most of the rock gets smashed and lost , so that only ten or twenty percent is actually worth keeping .  
The angry answer comes back that it is society 's search for simplistic explanations that is the problem and that , at his age , the youth is just discovering what a cold , shallow , arrogant culture he lives in - - where the worth of human beings is rated on the basis of the square footage of their homes , their net incomes and exam results , rather than on love and dignity .  
First of all , father became much more clearheaded and even his extra workload could not ruffle his calm tranquility . Then there was mother , who became even more concerned about people , often asking my younger brother 's fellow students to come over and eat . My elder brothers also gradually grew less vain as they turned to the pursuit of real inner worth .  
A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
Never mind the boss wife 's beautiful , fresh outward appearance that makes her seem so intelligent and capable . Actually , her self image and sense of personal worth may very well be stunted by the view she has long fostered that she must always look after others and not care for herself , " Wu Cheng-tien explains . When it comes to having the boss wife give over all her professional obligations to someone else , there usually is an ineffable feeling of loss .  
" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
It is worth mentioning that the tower 's flagpole , which has been jokingly called " The Greatest Pole Under Heaven , " is made up of five large , medium and small cannon barrels joined together . A few years ago when the flagpole had to be replaced because of rust , the president 's office specially commissioned a fengshui master to calculate an auspicious day for raising the new pole .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
According to our youngest writer and photographer , who with great courage and professionalism personally tried paragliding , it is worth it . Indeed , flying must be personally experienced to be fully comprehended . As for myself , however , I will pass - - my daring has faded with the years , and I will have to fly vicariously through our article .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance . Meanwhile her friends were trying to staunch her bleeding while at the same time shaking her and shouting at her for all they were worth so as not to let her pass out . . . .  
Although this is a new and ambitious research project and no one can tell if it will succeed or not , the chance to help numerous people improve their nutritional intake , physical condition and thus national educational levels and competitiveness , is well worth the effort .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations . We do n't have any kind of life experience that 's worth being proud of , that we can pass on to the next generation . "  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures . But the problem was that children just had one way to succeed . What 's worth applauding about multiple-track admissions is that it lets children with different sets of strengths all have a chance to get ahead . "  
Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .  
Likewise , any temple worth its salt expects to receive offerings of a certain aesthetic standard . In Buddhist music too , there is a range of quality , ranging from the superb to the dire .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
Internationally , the trend is certainly for the big to get bigger . For example , at the end of 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland merged with Swiss Bank Corporation , and the following year Deutsche Bank purchased Bankers Trust , while Citibank merged with Travelers Group . This last merger , between two companies that were already giants , gave the resulting firm a solid grip on its ranking as the financial institution with the highest net worth in the world .  
The value of cultural assets lies not in monetary worth , and still less in prices paid , but in the accumulation and passing down to future generations of the fruits of human intellectual and spiritual wisdom .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
" To be designated a historic site , a building must be a repository of excellent stories , " observes Yu Chao-ching . " Otherwise , its architectural workmanship must be remarkable . Its character , special qualities and worth must first be understood . " Yu points out that successful architectural preservation is a process of constant change-of preserving what is good in a site , and then adding new good things to it .  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
But it is worth noting that these young people are rather dissatisfied with Taiwan 's current political and economic situation , and most believe they are powerless to affect the overall picture . This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
In the process , concepts such as multiculturalism , individual worth , and freedom as supreme have taken root throughout Taiwan . Dreams of democratization are the binding thread , bringing all these individualistic dreams together , while Taiwan 's past dreams of power are refined into a collective goal of economic development .  
Thrilling as stories of epic heroism may be , there is a subject even more worth pondering : How is it that the combative and courageous Bunun are so respectful and gentle in dealing with the other living things that share their mountain surroundings ?  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
BUCHAREST , January 24 ( Xinhua ) Romania has absorbed a total of 650-million dollars worth of foreign capital last year a sum equal to all of the foreign money flowing into the country in the previous four years  
The idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law is worth considering as a transitional measure , although the manner in which this is effected will require deliberate study .  
At the heart of democracy and its inherent political pluralism are certain basic guarantees that uphold the sovereignty of the people , the worth and dignity of the individual , the rule of law , full respect for and protection of fundamental human rights and , above all , the peaceful search for human development .  
The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran , inspired by the divine teachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity and the continued participation and efforts of its people , has endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for human values , a society whose ethos includes fairness and social justice as well as cultural , social and economic development .

On the level of Chinese history , it was the main stage of expansion of the Han Chinese to Taiwan and it worth exploring for the light it can shed on the process of development , on relations between the Han Chinese and the aborigines , and on the history of the Cheng clan .

Chou Mi-mi director of the Revival Youth Yueh Drama Troupe , explains that the performance style of Yueh drama incorporates the best elements of Peking opera , spoken drama and folk opera .

A Young Forty : It 's a natural human instinct to love singing . Although some criticize Taiwan 's KTV culture as being vulgar , and there are even more people who loudly complain that you have to go to supplementary school even for karaoke , for the vast majority of those who love to sing , whatever the cost in time and money , it 's worth it for that moment of joy of singing a song well , and soaking up the sounds of applause .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior .

As for myself , however , I will pass - - my daring has faded with the years , and I will have to fly vicariously through our article .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had .

When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance .

Recently he has introduced the United Nations ' newest perspectives on human rights . Nevertheless , Chai , whose head of white hair reveals his years , admits he feels that society is changing too fast . " Everyone is groping in the dark as we face new situations .

There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures .

Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .

In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
Internationally , the trend is certainly for the big to get bigger . For example , at the end of 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland merged with Swiss Bank Corporation , and the following year Deutsche Bank purchased Bankers Trust , while Citibank merged with Travelers Group . This last merger , between two companies that were already giants , gave the resulting firm a solid grip on its ranking as the financial institution with the highest net worth in the world .

And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business .

Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
" To be designated a historic site , a building must be a repository of excellent stories , " observes Yu Chao-ching . " Otherwise , its architectural workmanship must be remarkable .

" Yu points out that successful architectural preservation is a process of constant change-of preserving what is good in a site , and then adding new good things to it .  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth .

This survey also points up an important trend : among this generation with its extremely high proportion of highly educated people , education level is a significant variable when it comes to values and dreams . Compared with the past , the dreams and values of highly educated people are driving and guiding the direction of this generation as never before !  
In the process , concepts such as multiculturalism , individual worth , and freedom as supreme have taken root throughout Taiwan . Dreams of democratization are the binding thread , bringing all these individualistic dreams together , while Taiwan 's past dreams of power are refined into a collective goal of economic development .  
Thrilling as stories of epic heroism may be , there is a subject even more worth pondering : How is it that the combative and courageous Bunun are so respectful and gentle in dealing with the other living things that share their mountain surroundings ?  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .
