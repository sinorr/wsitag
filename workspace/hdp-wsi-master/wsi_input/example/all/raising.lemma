Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar .

Water buffalos and Chinese cattle produce just enough to feed their calves , without any extra for people . Domestic livestock and poultry have always been a major source of animal protein , with the sole point in raising them being to fill our bellies . New , improved varieties with rapid growth , greater fecundity or better taste have won favor over time , and pure native strains that have n't been interbred have gradually declined in popularity or even face extinction .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns .

"  
The National Science Council 's Twelve-Year Plan for Scientific and Technological Development identifies its four main goals as upgrading science and technology , advancing economic development , raising the public 's quality of life and establishing an independent national defense .  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
Yet on this occasion Yang was able to put out five such vehicles .

These changes included raising the efficiency of electricity use from 27.5% to 45% ; lowering the recharging time to two hours ; and making it possible to precisely measure the battery capacity . These innovations have greatly increased the practicality of the electric vehicle .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
The custom of raising havoc in the bridal chamber reaches back into the mists of Chinese history ; maybe it really is a " unique treasure of Chinese culture . " But as it has changed and evolved through countless generations , perhaps it has lost its original meaning , and even become a controversial practice which smacks of abusing the bride .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey . " It 's like bombing a chicken with napalm , " says the well-informed Chen . Wide-wingspread falcons are extremely fast , and require a huge amount of space , and are completely unsuitable for mountainous Taiwan .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
You might see a great spread of white mushrooms growing on the withered trunk of an old dead maple , truly manifesting the idea " working even at the time of death . " It used to be that maple trees provided the best place for raising mushrooms , but sadly , in recent years the maples were almost all cut down , and they are very rare these days , so production has shifted to germ-free packaged propagation .  
Adapted from a story in Lin Yu-tang 's Chinese Legends , The Arch is set in a remote village in southwest China , where a 34-year-old widow lives , dutifully supporting her mother-in-law and raising her only daughter - - as workers build a traditional arch attesting to the widow 's faithful and self-sacrificing behavior .  
He believed that a nation 's musical roots are to be found in its folk songs , and so he went among the people to collect this music , which reflects the life of the great majority - - the lowest level in Huang You-li 's pyramid . After sorting the wheat from the chaff , Bartok incorporated the folk songs into his own works , thus not only creating a unique personal style , but also preserving folk music and raising it to a higher artistic level .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
It is worth mentioning that the tower 's flagpole , which has been jokingly called " The Greatest Pole Under Heaven , " is made up of five large , medium and small cannon barrels joined together . A few years ago when the flagpole had to be replaced because of rust , the president 's office specially commissioned a fengshui master to calculate an auspicious day for raising the new pole .  
For example , the public is allowed to walk through the Po Ai district , but mindful of being watched , everyone 's mood naturally grows more solemn upon entering it . People talk in hushed tones and do n't linger - - let alone line up and make a lot of noise ( the only exception being the music corps responsible for handling the daily flag raising and lowering ceremonies ) .  
Of course , if the targets for expansion of the wild salmon population are reached , there are regulations governing the raising of animals which , strictly applied , should prevent artificially propagated animals from getting mixed into the species in the wild . Of course then it would be fine to take a few samples from nature for research into artificial propagation .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
Many people , regardless of how they feel about classical music , recognize that raising the " quality " of the nation is something that begins within people themselves . We must now simply wait to see what sort of reactions will be stirred by this encounter between the mass medium of radio , and the refined realm of classical music .  
In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species . Today we must work hard to make up for this lacuna , otherwise if non-native species are planted as cash crops , the final result may be the same as with pine wilt disease : that we will benefit from neither the introduced nor our native species . Reshuffling the cards  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world .

He believed that a nation 's musical roots are to be found in its folk songs , and so he went among the people to collect this music , which reflects the life of the great majority - - the lowest level in Huang You-li 's pyramid .

The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
It is worth mentioning that the tower 's flagpole , which has been jokingly called " The Greatest Pole Under Heaven , " is made up of five large , medium and small cannon barrels joined together . A few years ago when the flagpole had to be replaced because of rust , the president 's office specially commissioned a fengshui master to calculate an auspicious day for raising the new pole .  
For example , the public is allowed to walk through the Po Ai district , but mindful of being watched , everyone 's mood naturally grows more solemn upon entering it .

Of course , if the targets for expansion of the wild salmon population are reached , there are regulations governing the raising of animals which , strictly applied , should prevent artificially propagated animals from getting mixed into the species in the wild .

Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
Many people , regardless of how they feel about classical music , recognize that raising the " quality " of the nation is something that begins within people themselves .

In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species . Today we must work hard to make up for this lacuna , otherwise if non-native species are planted as cash crops , the final result may be the same as with pine wilt disease : that we will benefit from neither the introduced nor our native species . Reshuffling the cards  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
Following the economic development of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners , the number of cooperative programs the new Agricultural Technology Missions are involved in has steadily increased . In addition to growing grain and vegetables , the scope of the missions has also come to include animal husbandry work-raising pigs and chickens ; marine technology-fishing techniques and the breeding and raising of marine animals ; handicraft work-bamboo weaving , wood carving ; and such areas of work as flood prevention and water conservation projects among others .  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children . Even women who are gradually moving out of the house and into the working world do everything they can to meet the demands of both house and job .  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " ( the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , and raising economic competitiveness .

Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "
