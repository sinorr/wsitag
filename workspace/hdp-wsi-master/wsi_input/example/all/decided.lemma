The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
The aforementioned Act , which seeks forcibly to stifle the Cuban social and economic system through the application of punitive measures against sovereign countries that have decided to maintain economic relations with Cuba , was adopted despite the outright rejection with which it was greeted by the international community from its inception as a bill , and particularly by the North American allies , owing to its extraterritorial and unilateral nature and the fact that it infringes the sovereignty of States and violates the principles of international law .

In this respect nuclear disarmament remains an inescapable objective , as the international community decided 20 years ago , one which is itself an integral component of general and complete disarmament .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .
