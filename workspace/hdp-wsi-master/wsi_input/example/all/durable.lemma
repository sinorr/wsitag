It was stated that the Government was committed to working with Maori to find ways to further Maori interests , and to work towards its goals of achieving social and economic parity between Maori and non-Maori , and reaching fair and durable settlements to proven historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi .  
The favourable response with which the United Nations system and other governmental and non-governmental organizations greeted the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa led us to believe that the international community would , in a meaningful way , join in the activities undertaken by Africa to resolve conflicts , consolidate democracy and ensure economic and social development .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage .

Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
The quest for a unilateral security advantage for a few or the assertion of the right to an exclusive standard of national security is contrary to the spirit of a durable and sustainable system of international security in todays world .  
As the Panel 's report makes clear in paragraph 2 , the underlying objective of the sanctions is to foster a durable political settlement to the civil war in Angola by limiting UNITA 's ability to pursue its objectives by military means .  
The return of the Serb refugees to Kosovo , in particular , would certainly be a tangible sign of the durable abating of tensions and attainment of the entire international communitys objective of building a peaceful , democratic and multiethnic Kosovo .  
Worthy of particular note in his report was the message conveyed to the Mission by the heads of State of the region , who thought that greater subregional integration in the political , security , economic and social spheres should remain a key objective for the United Nations family if durable solutions to conflict and to the tragic humanitarian suffering that accompanies conflict are to be secured .  
In conclusion , we hope that todays very broad discussion with the family of United Nations organs and agencies , relevant institutions and Member States will be a step forward to the successful implementation of a fully integrated and broad-based subregional approach aimed at addressing the multifaceted problems confronting the region and promoting durable peace and sustainable development in West Africa .

The meeting had been inconclusive , however , and the Personal Envoy had called upon the parties to come forward at a meeting to be held in June , with concrete solutions to the multiple problems of the settlement plan that the parties could agree to , or else be prepared to consider and discuss other ways to achieve an early , durable and agreed resolution of their dispute over Western Sahara .  
An important conclusion that could be drawn from the situation and the corresponding financial responses of the Advisory Committee and the Fifth Committee was that the budgetary mechanisms and procedures that the General Assembly had established in resolution 49 / 233 A had proven to be practical , flexible and durable .  
At its thirty-fourth ordinary session , held in July 2001 , the Heads of State and Government of OAU adopted a resolution , entitled Fiftieth Anniversary of the Adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of the Refugees , in which member States reaffirmed their commitment to finding durable solutions to refugee problems , most importantly , by facilitating voluntary repatriation , while endeavouring to create conducive conditions to that effect , and concomitantly take preventive measures , and peacefully resolve conflicts in order to avoid the forced displacement of populations . 
Recognize that prevention is the best way to avoid refugee situations and emphasize that the ultimate goal of international protection is to achieve a durable solution for refugees , consistent with the principle of non-refoulement , and commend States that continue to facilitate these solutions , notably voluntary repatriation and , where appropriate and feasible , local integration and resettlement , while recognizing that voluntary repatriation in conditions of safety and dignity remains the preferred solution for refugees ;

If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition .

A smaller number of resettlement places is required , predominantly for selected individuals whose physical security is threatened , or for vulnerable refugees for whom resettlement remains the only suitable , durable and humane solution .  
This is so for a number of reasons : first , its long-standing relationship with the countries in and around the conflict area and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and durable political settlement ; secondly , because of the experience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a long record of practical work in the area ; thirdly , acquired knowledge and expertise in working with international financial institutions in implementing programmes for reconstruction and development .

" As no consideration of the maintenance of international peace and security would be complete without acknowledging the essential role of economic and social factors both in the origin of conflicts and in the building of a durable peace , we reiterate our commitment to the establishment of a dynamic , vigorous and equitable international economic environment that decisively contributes to the stability and prosperity of all nations and peoples .

We always believe that however complicated a dispute between States or an internal conflict in a country may be , we should encourage the parties concerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation and dialogue , for this is the only right and effective way to a comprehensive and durable settlement .  The practices of imposing sanctions , using military force or even expanding a war in order to stop it are not conducive to a settlement .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .

The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
In so doing , Japan deems it important to keep in mind in particular that in our present-day world , peace and stability can not be achieved and maintained solely on the basis of political and military factors , but that stable and durable peace can be realized only through efforts that take into account a wider perspective which comprises humanitarian concerns and social and economic reconstruction and development as well .  
While the Dayton Peace Agreement has laid a constructive basis for the cessation of armed hostilities and the creation of a favourable climate for the formation of a stable and durable structure of state in Bosnia and Herzegovina , a great deal needs to be done to translate the pious desire of the international community into a working reality .
