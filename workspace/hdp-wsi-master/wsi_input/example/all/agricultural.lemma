When chickens began to die in large numbers , the owner of the farm made an immediate report to the epidemic prevention section at the basic level .  As soon as preliminary diagnosis revealed possible cases of bird flu , the samples were immediately sent to the provincial agricultural committee and soon confirmed as suspected cases .  
Up to now , 34 cities and counties in this province are listed as coastal open economy cities and counties , covering 44% of the whole province 's total area , among which , there are 7 national level development zones of various kinds and some provincial level economic development zones and provincial level agricultural development zones as well .  
An official from the Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Department said that , since 1994 the number of " three-capital " enterprises that have been approved by the agricultural system of Jiangsu province has exceeded 500 , and the amount of foreign capital being put to use was more than 700-million US dollars , which represented threefold and sevenfold increases , respectively , over the years before 1993 .  
For a future period of time , China will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in new agricultural technology , comprehensive development of land resources , and such basic industries and pillar industries as water conservation , energy , transportation , important raw materials , machinery and electronics , mining , etc . and will encourage foreign businessmen to employ new high level technology to participate in the technical transformation of China 's enterprises  
Wuhan , in Hubei province , located in the center of China 's interior , will , in the future , put emphasis on utilizing foreign capital in the areas of the high-tech industry , basic industries , infrastructure construction , agricultural development , etc .  
Gross domestic output values reached 73-billion yuan in 1995 , increasing by 4 times compared with 1978 , before the reform and opening up .  The average living expenses and income of city and township residents reached 4053 yuan , and the average pure income of peasants reached 1554 yuan .  The total industrial and agricultural output value was 144-billion yuan , among which the former was 120.1-billion yuan .  Third industry output values reached 24.7-billion yuan , accounting for 33% of the gross domestic output value .  
According to data provided by the Guangzhou Statistics Office , last year , Guangzhou completed a gross domestic product of 144.584-billion yuan ; completed industrial added values of 57.348-billion yuan ; agricultural added values of 8.075-billion yuan ; fixed asset investments of 65.545-billion yuan ; total social consumable retail amounts of 64.432-billion yuan ; foreign trade export values of 6.513-billion US dollars ; actual utilized foreign investments of 2.6-billion US dollars ; and a retail goods price index increase of 4.3% .  
Laiwu City of Shandong Province has established a cell structure cultivation center inside the agricultural new high level technology development and model zones , to introduce and tame improved breeds of nurseries , flowers and vegetables from home and abroad .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
In the agricultural new high level technology development and model zone of Zibo City in the Zhangdian District , plan to establish a agricultural scientific research training institute , a breeding area for improved agricultural varieties , an organic vegetable area , a quality orchard , the fine stock breeding farm , etc .  
In order to satisfy the requirements of the continuously expanding overseas markets , various areas of Guangdong have adjusted to local conditions and selected famous , special and improved varieties , and have built up more than 2,000 agricultural export merchandise production and processing bases .  
The entire province has actually utilized foreign funds of nearly 1-billion US dollars , and has established a large number of extroverted agricultural " three capital " enterprises which combine agriculture , industry , trade and technology and integrate manufacturing , supply and marketing , and through foreign merchants sales channels , it has also expanded its export of agricultural products .  
In the 20th century , following the great agricultural development that occurred between the late 1970s and early 1980s , and the rapid development during the mid-1980s of light industries such as textiles and home appliances , as well as the tertiary industries , and with all the accelerated developments in infrastructure and basic industries that were seen during the 1990s , countless problems have gradually seen their solution in China .  
Joining the WTO will help China to import in appropriate amounts agricultural staple products for which land resources are the main production element and in which China lacks relative advantage , and also to export labor-intensive agricultural products such as fruit , vegetables , and animal and aquatic products .  This will help in our restructuring of crop cultivation and stock breeding in agriculture and in improving the economic returns of agriculture .  
For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
The import of advanced technology and varieties such as mechanized stockraising , enclosed fish-rearing , the processing , storage , and preserving of agricultural produce , foodstuff processing , covering young plants with plastic film , and introduction of fine seed strains has markedly enhanced the level of modernization of China 's agriculture and grain production .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
the people of the whole country have expressed an ardent wish to build a prosperous nation through science and education and a strong country through knowledge ; the whole country 's industrial and agricultural structures have been undergoing major readjustment ; the enterprises have been engaged in technical innovation ;  
Meanwhile , the " Opinions " has also put forward concrete views on how people 's courts can successfully provide a legal guarantee for both the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the development of the rural economy , standardize the financial order according to the law , guard against and avert financial risks , protect intellectual property rights , and provide a guarantee for a sound implementation of the strategy of carrying out a large-scale development in China 's western region .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
Proceeding from the special needs of the economic and social development in China 's western region , we should lay stress on the spread and application of improved varieties of agricultural products , dry farming and water-economizing farming , a comprehensive utilization of resources , new materials and new energies , and advanced technologies in the aspect of ecological environmental protection .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
They tried 290 cases of selling food below sanitary standards or poisonous harmful food , products below safety standards , counterfeit medicine , as well as counterfeit and bad quality agricultural chemicals , animal medicine , chemical fertilizers , and seeds , an increase of 24 percent over the previous year , involving the punishment of 267 criminals .  
In the economic and trade sphere , we should positively strive to set up the ' Fujian Experimental Zone for Economic Cooperation Across the Straits ' at an early date , continue to run the existing Taiwan-funded enterprises properly , fully exercise the demonstrative role of the Taiwan investment zone , accelerate the construction of the cross-strait agricultural cooperative experimental zone , have a good grasp of the pilot project of direct sea navigation , and positively explore the new path for direct trade across the straits .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
Article 24 In places where industrial wastewater and urban sewage are used for irrigation , the agricultural authority of local people 's governments at or above the county level shall organize regular monitoring of the quality of water used for irrigation and the irrigated soil and farm produce and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the pollution of soil , underground water , and farm produce .  
Chen Xiwen has long been involved in agricultural economic theory and policy research .  He worked on drafting documents for the central government regarding problems of farming villages .  He wrote more than 10 books about this subject .  He also published more than 150 dissertations and research reports .  He is an expert in this field .  
It is not just in agriculture .  Improving agricultural quality and raising the quality of farming products is based on the attitude of national economic smoothness and lasting development .  Improving farmers ' income is the basic difference from the past .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
The western region should energetically develop a pillar industry and competitive products , strive to develop new products , and form an agricultural product processing system focusing on the production of grain and cereal oil products , meat products , fruit and vegetable products , and traditional Chinese medicinal herb products with local distinguishing features and national characteristics .  
It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
While inspecting rural areas in Shaanxi recently , Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau , member of the Secretariat , and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : This is a crucial year in the new stage of China 's agricultural and rural economic development .  After consecutive years of bumper harvests , the agriculture sector is faced with the heavy tasks of restructuring , raising efficiency , and raising peasants ' income .  Therefore , it is of vital significance to do our job well in agriculture and rural areas .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
With the driving force of the overseas Chinese , this city achieved uncommon , vigorous , and rapid growth .  In ten years the total value of industrial and agricultural output grew 90-fold , and their overall economic strength jumped from being near the last in the province to one of the top three .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .  
While vigorously developing agriculture , the DPRK party and government have actively developed the agricultural sideline production and encouraged the people to plant mulberries to raise silkworms and to raise fish and pigs with a view to improving the people 's consumption .  In the meantime , the party and government have launched a nationwide lecture on popular science knowledge to disseminate the knowledge of growing cash crops and breeding animals with economic value .  
With a high forest acreage and abundant hydroelectric resources , it has favorable natural conditions and resources for economic development .  Its annual average agricultural output is three times the residents ' total demand .  It is June now , and waves of golden wheat can be seen everywhere in fields of rich black soil .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
A pertinent expert of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that some difficulties and problems still existed in the agricultural and rural economic operations at present .  The comparatively conspicuous ones included the relatively great impacts of drought , plant diseases , and insect pests on crops , the continued low prices of most agricultural products , the relatively numerous difficulties confronting the development of township and town enterprises , and so on .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
In the New Year editorial , the DPRK stated that it would , in the new year , " streamline the current economic foundation , carry out comprehensive transformation of the economy with modern technologies and methods , step up the building of power , coal , metallurgy , rail transport sectors , increase agricultural production , develop the light industry , and raise the people 's living standards . "  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
We hope grassroots cadres , peasants , and herdsmen of all agricultural and pastoral areas across the autonomous region will enhance their sense of catching up with and surpassing other regions .  We hope they will conscientiously learn from the experience gained and measures taken by Deqen village and other advanced villages , and further unfold the vigorous campaign of learning from , catching up with , and striving to be the advanced .  
We hope various levels of party committees and governments across the autonomous region will earnestly put into effect the party 's policies toward agricultural and pastoral areas and unite and lead the broad masses of cadres to develop production , improve living standards , " bring social order out of chaos , " and " tackle problems caused by stupidity , " so that our region will advance by leaps and bounds and achieve prolonged political stability .  
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
The vast numbers of rural grass-roots cadres should practice a good work style and lead the broad masses of peasants to push ahead strategic adjustments of the agricultural and rural economic structures , and help peasants increase their incomes and live a happy life .  
By checking and taking inventory of the stock and figuring out the bottom line , it provides an accurate and reliable basis for helping the state to formulate a macro regulation and control policy with regard to grain production and circulation and to actively promote the readjustment of the agricultural structure and increase the peasants ' income , and we can then help to ensure the timely transfer and proper utilization of the state 's grain stockpile when needed .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
After our WTO entry , China , as a member country of the World Trade Organization , will enjoy multilateral , unconditional and stable most-favored nation treatment .  When we become involved in a trade dispute involving agriculture products , we can rely on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to reach a more fair and reasonable solution , and this will reduce such unfair treatment as non-tariff restrictions aimed at Chinese agricultural exports by other countries .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
After our WTO entry , our agricultural product markets and agricultural key element markets will be tied to the international market , and this will help us learn from others , introduce competitive mechanisms and regulations of the international market , and accelerate a sound and complete market system and operational mechanism for agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  
At the same time , because various non-tariff measures will be prohibited , our country can not employ traditional protective measures to protect domestic markets for agricultural products .  We can only learn and explore " the green box policy " with which we are unfamiliar , and , in certain regards , do not have the proper conditions to employ .  Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
This requires us to first establish the focal points for the construction of large scale agricultural wholesale markets and specialized wholesale markets in cities and towns , supporting it by constructing market centers to connect the numerous peasants , and completing the whole chain by constructing such key elements of the market as capital , information , technology and labor forces , to form a unified market system in cities and towns that will ensure smooth circulation of goods between cities and towns .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
Given that the degree of marketization is increasing all the time , and agricultural development is shifting from being mainly constrained by resources to being doubly constrained by resources and demand , structural contradictions are extremely conspicuous , relative surpluses of a phased and structural nature have emerged in agricultural products , sales are sluggish , prices have fallen , and the comparative returns on agriculture have declined year by year .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Hence , the whole process of this study and education drive must be based on arming the rural grassroots cadres with the important thinking on " three represents " ; in particular , it is essential to strengthen their concept of wholeheartedly serving the people , improve their ability to carry out agricultural restructuring and develop rural economy , strengthen their ability to do mass work well in the new situation , and enhance their consciousness of persistently " grasping things with both hands , and firmly with both hands . "  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
Currently it is necessary to pay great attention to several conspicuous problems that have a direct bearing on the immediate interests of the broad masses of the people , have provoked a strong reaction from the masses , and have caused serious harm to society .  Measures to be taken primarily in this respect are : cracking down on the production and sale of counterfeit goods and shoddy goods , with an emphasis on foodstuffs , medicines , agricultural materials , cotton , and assembled vehicles ;  
To properly accomplish the economic rural restructuring in our country , we must clearly understand and master the regularity in the evolution of agricultural and the rural economic structure , and then seize the key points based on such understanding , thus making advances in an orderly way .  
Since the 1980 ' s , the central government has practiced a series of preferential policies toward Tibet , which include the agricultural tax exemption for the agricultural and pastoral areas in recuperation and the abolition of planned purchases and quota purchases of agricultural , animal , special , and local products by the state ;  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .  
Experts attending the meeting unanimously held : The research project " China 's Agricultural Practice and Development " systematically studied and expounded the whole process of agricultural changes and development in China over thousands of years , comprehensively displayed the huge achievements in China 's agriculture , analyzed the problems appearing in China 's agricultural practice , summed up positive and negative experiences , revealed the objective laws governing the development of agriculture , and put forward the ideas and recommendations on speeding up China 's agricultural development .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
Long Yongtu , vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and the ministry 's chief WTO negotiator , once flew into a rage over an unreasonable demand by some developed member nations that China protect its agricultural products at the 5 percent level , as do the developed countries .  He fumed , " Why deprive us of the right to protect our peasants ? "  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
We must securely grasp the developmental characteristics of the farming and animal husbandry industries and of the industries in countrysides and towns , adjust economic structures in agricultural and pastoral industries , which , after all , are the main threads of our work ; revolve around increasing the incomes of peasants and animal herders , which is the core concern ; and promote overall economic and social developmental progress in impoverished areas .  
Meanwhile , the 10th Five-Year Plan for Sci-Tech Development has clearly defined the following concrete goals for China 's sci-tech development : First , we should greatly improve our industrial level and international competitiveness .  We should ensure that the technical level of the major domains of our agricultural , industrial , and service sectors would be improved to the same level as enjoyed by advanced countries in the mid-1990s .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
On 19 June , the Chinese government officially retaliated against Japan for adopting a policy on 23 April that restricted imports of Chinese green onions and some other Chinese agricultural products .  It announced that in the near future it would impose special tariffs on imports of three types of Japanese-produced products : automobiles , wireless mobile and car phones and air conditioners .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
This year the main effort will be devoted to resolving five prominent problems that directly damage the masses ' vital interests , which arouse strong reaction in society , and in which the masses can participate to a high degree : First , crack down on the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and inferior goods , with the focus on foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals , agricultural production materials , cotton , and assembled motor vehicles ;  
3 .  The use of administrative review , approval , and licensing mechanisms , the conditional sale or sales promotion of products , and forcing agricultural people to accept services and pay fees which have no documented legal foundation , is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees .  
5 .  Government organizations whose duties include review and approval of matters in accordance with laws and regulations , and who impose on agricultural people a fee which is not clearly specified in laws or regulations and which has not been reviewed and approved by national and provincial level planning , pricing , or finance organizations , are committing an act which is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees .  
7 .  Collecting electricity fees which exceed electricity price standards , assessing agricultural people unjustified electricity fees , collecting rural network renovation fees which have not been approved by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , or collecting fees which exceed those formulated by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , is classified as an illegal pricing action .  
Legally authorized fees reviewed and approved at the national and provincial level , and policies formulated by organizations in charge of prices at the central and provincial levels which involve agricultural prices and the collection of fees for services , must also be thoroughly put in order .  Start with a grasp of the actual situation , examine items category by category , reexamine and define .  
and go down to the basic level and enterprises more frequently to immerse ourselves among the vast numbers of masses in agricultural and pastoral areas , indicated Legqog . Through conducting thoroughgoing and practical investigations and studies , we will be able to have a definite object in view when guiding the region 's economic work , fulfill all our tasks in a more thoroughgoing and effective way , and ensure a complete success for our work in all fields .  
To readjust the structure of farming and stock breeding as well as the economic structure in agricultural and pastoral areas , we should readjust and optimize the structure of farming and stock breeding in line with the principle of " suiting measures to local conditions , giving greater prominence to key issues , integrating farming with stock breeding , and ensuring a well-coordinated development " ;  
We must start with an understanding of the actual situation in Xigaze , use as a foothold the abundant local resources , and work hard to develop the production of high-quality , highly effective , distinctive agricultural and livestock products .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
In the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " overall input into comprehensive agricultural development totaled 82.7-billion yuan of all types of funds ; the aggregate planned reformed mid-level production land was 173-million mu , the area of newly added and improved irrigation was 132-million mu , the area of newly added and improved reclaimed land was 60.33-million mu , and the area of increased field forest protection was 89.64-million mu , thus forcefully promoting the gradual heightening of China 's comprehensive agricultural production capabilities .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
We must adhere to taking irrigation as the focus of basic agricultural construction , continuing the reform of mid-level production fields , developing high yield , stable yield , water economizing , and highly effective agricultural fields , effectively consolidating , protecting , and raising the production capabilities of China 's basic agricultural fields . b ) .  
We must actively support the development of agricultural product processing industries , taking a path of integrated trade , industrial , and agricultural industrialization .  We must bolster qualified enterprises in their development of agricultural production , processing , and export bases , enhancing the motivating power on farmers by the market competition forces , and raising the level of agricultural production organization and the international competitive power of China 's agriculture .  
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation demanded that increasing export by every possible means should be regarded as a top priority in the development of China 's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the second half of this year , and that it is necessary to promote the export of mechanical and electrical products , textiles , and other traditional staple commodities and the export of new hi-tech products and agricultural products , and give impetus to export by major exporters and foreign-invested enterprises .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
On 9 May , the State Council held the second video and telephone conference on nationally coordinated operation to crack down on the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities and made arrangements for the nationwide joint operation against the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities , focusing on food , medicines , agricultural supplies , cotton , and illegally assembled automobiles using cannibalized parts .  
The main grain producing areas must seize the opportunity of the expanded grain market space following the opening up of the sales areas , to meet market demands , optimize the grain variety composition , improve the quality , develop industrialized operations , and achieve the goal of increasing agricultural economic returns and peasant incomes .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
To enable China 's agriculture to make positive reactions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by China 's participation in WTO and at the same time , support the great development of China 's west and protect agricultural resources and ecological environment , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] will quicken the pace of agricultural legislation , more intensively formulate laws and regulations to meet urgent needs , and to make timely reexamination and revision of the laws and regulations which are not suited to the development of the situation .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .

- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;  
Introducing the practice of a comprehensive agricultural development which mainly aims at strengthening the building of basic agricultural facilities , protecting and improving the ecological environment , and developing a high-quality agriculture with a high yield and a high efficiency conforms to the requirements of the WTO 's " green box " policy ; and is also an important way for the government to support and protect agriculture at a time when China 's agriculture is heading for internationalization , he stressed .  
Thanks to the comprehensive agricultural development over the past more than 10 years , an average annual increase of 53.17 billion kg has been registered in the country 's grain production capacity , and the newly increased per capita net income of peasants in project areas stands 260 yuan higher at average than that of peasants in non-project areas .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
Xiang Huaicheng stressed : In comprehensive agricultural development , we must abide by the natural law and strengthen ecological environmental development to bring about sustainable economic and social development .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
Practice has fully proven that the central policies on grain reform are entirely correct and have played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for grain production , giving impetus to agricultural structural adjustment , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
China 's agricultural and rural economic development has now entered a new stage , in which farm products , particularly grain , have turned from a long-standing shortage to a basic balance of supply with demand and even a surplus in years of bumper harvests , and agricultural development has changed from being subject to resource restraints to being subject to the dual restraints of resources and markets .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
In addition , regarding the 85 duty paragraphs of agricultural products which the US side is concerned about , the two sides agreed that the actual customs tariff of 30.8 percent at the signing of the agreement will be reduced to 14.5 percent in five years , the total amount of import quotas for wheat , rice , and corn set at 13 million tonnes in 2000 will be raised to 23 million tonnes in 2004 , and the business volume of non-state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be increased too .  
The results show that between 1993 and 1995 , the total annual average amount of the " green box policy " and input subsidies for China 's agriculture , which can be exempt from deductions , was 87.3 billion yuan , equivalent to only 9.4 percent of the agricultural added value , while the AMS [ previous acronym given in English ] for farm produce which needed to undertake the responsibility for deductions and which directly and indirectly affected trade , was negative for three years , with the annual average amount at minus 74.3 billion yuan .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that flood and drought have always been the serious hidden problems affecting China 's economic and social development and the people 's livelihood , and the impact of drought on agricultural production is particularly prominent .  All localities must firmly embrace the idea of fighting a major drought for a long time .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .  Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
As the longest river in China , Chang Jiang has 1.7 square kilometers of drainage areas , one fourth of the country 's cultivated areas , and one third of the country 's entire population ; and turns out two fifths of the country 's total industrial and agricultural output value .  The Chang Jiang valley plays a decisive role in China 's national economic and social development .  
As a result , although the labor productivity of agriculture in developing countries is the same as that of the industrial sector which is considerably lower than that in advanced countries , the domestic prices of primary agricultural products and their processed and manufactured goods are generally lower than the prices in the international markets , thus enjoying an absolute advantage .  
A wise way to adapt ourselves to the tide of globalization is to exchange concessions in land-intensive grain for a greater export of labor-intensive fresh agricultural products , and to exchange the opening-up of China 's monopolized industries for a greater share in the international market for China 's agriculture and its light industrial and textile industry - - Only this can be said a correct countermeasure .  
The outdated mode of agricultural production characterized by overflowing the field with water must be resolutely changed , the development of water-saving irrigation and dry farming should be taken as the basic work and fundamental measure for combating drought , and the transformation of farming system focusing on the economy on water should be carried out .  
Vice governors , vice chairmen , and vice mayors from pertinent provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in charge of agricultural and rural work , comrades in charge of pertinent departments including planning , agriculture , water conservancy , civil affairs , and finance , comrades in charge of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , and comrades in charge of pertinent departments under the central authorities and the State Council attended the conference .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
The law on farm seeds adopted at this meeting is of great significance in protecting and using seed resources , standardizing the breeding , production , management , and use of seeds , protecting the legitimate rights and interests of seed breeders , producers , managers , and users , improving the quality of seeds , promoting an industrial management of farm seeds , expediting agricultural development through science and technology , and promoting the development of crop farming .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
The practice over the past several years fully shows that the policy on the reform of the grain circulation system , with the stress on " three policies and one reform , " has played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for growing grain crops , expediting agricultural restructuring , promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
The burdens on peasants are heavy , and the growth of their incomes has slowed down ; the problem of enlivening the rural market has yet to be effectively solved , and close attention should be paid to problems caused by natural agricultural disasters and a drop in grain production and in the prices of farm products .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
The bodies affiliated to the Tibet Science and Technology Association have translated and distributed 108 titles of popular science books which they have written for popularizing scientific knowledge and disseminating practical technology on topics such as scientific field cultivation , stockraising , and prevention and control of disease .  They have also shot Tibetan TV documentaries on advanced agricultural technology and sent them to the rural areas .  
Meanwhile , several large-scale enterprises in Taiwan are facing a financial crisis , natural disasters have occurred repeatedly in agricultural production , and farmers have difficulties in selling their products despite falling prices .  People have lost their interest in Taiwan 's stocks .  How can the stock market be saved by a " cardiac stimulant ? "  
To further intensify scientific and technological cooperation , the Chinese Government and the Japanese Government have decided to cooperatively develop a new round of 89 scientific and technological projects in the biological , nuclear energy , agricultural , medical , resources , and environmental protection fields .  
As China 's population has grown , the quality of people 's living standards has improved , economic and social development has quickened , and industrialization , urbanization , and agricultural modernization have speeded up , China 's water resources situation has become even worse , and contradictions between water supply and demand are becoming even more prominent .  So we must soberly realize the water problem .  
The main reason for prices to become stable in the first half of the year was due to some short-term factors , such as the hikes of international oil prices , the policy-related increases of house rentals and water and power rates , and dry climate in the north .  The prices of the great majority of industrial products and major agricultural products are still continuing to drop .  When such short-term factors disappear in the second half of the year , the possibility of a rally in prices as a whole will be slim .  
Agricultural departments at all levels and the vast numbers of agricultural scientific and technological personnel should go deep down to the forefront of production , help peasants fight droughts and ensure a successful spring sowing , see to a sound implementation of material and technological measures , pay close attention to the work of demonstration by example , guarantee the smooth progress of spring production , and lay a solid foundation for next year 's agricultural production .  
although grain output has fallen due to serious drought and adjustment of the sown area , output of various agricultural products such as oil-bearing crops , livestock , aquatic products , fruit , and vegetables has continued to increase ; there has been some rebound in the development speed and economic returns of the township and town enterprises ; the building of rural grassroots organizations , democracy and legal system , and spiritual civilization has been further stepped up ;  
Now a foundation has already been laid for our comprehensive national strength , and our country 's GDP in 2000 is expected to reach 8,600 billion yuan , with its total economic capacity ranking seventh in the world ; the output of major agricultural and industrial products have registered considerable growth , with the production of some of such products leaping to the fore front in the world .  
The key to achieving the continuous growth of peasants ' income lies in vigorously adjusting the agricultural structure , positively broadening the spheres for raising peasants ' income , and increasing the intensity of supporting and protecting agriculture to attain rural economic development on all sides . 
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the key to developing agricultural and rural economy and pushing forward agricultural modernization lies in the implementation of the strategy to invigorate agriculture on the strength of science and culture and place the training of qualified personnel in a prominent position .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , under the guidance of the party 's agricultural and rural policies , tremendous changes have taken place in the appearance of China 's rural areas , the rural economy has developed in a comprehensive way , peasants ' income has been notably increased , and stability has been maintained in rural society .  
The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
As China 's only agricultural high-technology industrial demonstration zone , Yangling should study and apply well the important ideology on " three represents , " really regard the development requirements for advanced productive forces , the orientation of advancement of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest number of people as the criteria for teaching , scientific research , technological development and all fields of work , and build the Yangling demonstration zone into a first-grade agricultural base for agricultural scientific research and technological development at home and abroad . .  
It is necessary to turn this agricultural demonstration zone into a national arid and semi-arid farming technological research and development center , an agricultural technician training center in the western region , a scientific and technological achievements conversion and industrial center , a center for breeding good strains , and an agricultural science and technological information spreading center .  
In addition to the joint announcement that has important meaning for developing the relationship between China and Laos , the relative departments of the two countries signed an agreement on economic technology , a summary of the first meeting of the economic trade skill cooperation committees , exchange notes for China agreeing to undertake Luang Prabang hospital items , an agreement to develop leopoldite resources in the Vientiane area , and an memorandum of understanding for agricultural cooperation .  There are altogether six bilateral cooperative documents .  
The agreement on China 's accession to the WTO signed between China and the United States has broken the monopoly of China 's state-owned foreign trade enterprises over the import and export of agricultural products , and special stipulations have been made regarding the shares of imported agricultural products between the state-owned foreign trade enterprises and private enterprises .  It means that private enterprises must be granted more rights on foreign trade operations .  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
In the aspect of agriculture and rural areas , the regional party committee and government have actively readjusted the production structure of agriculture and on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study formulated the opinions of the autonomous region about readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure of agricultural products and pushing forward the industrialized operation of agriculture and proposed that farm production should focus on improving quality and uphold the unification of output , quality , structure , and effectiveness .  
We must take further steps to integrate ideology with the Central Committee 's plans and requirements , increase understanding , strengthen confidence , take hold of opportunities , take prompt action , and conscientiously launch this round of study and educational activities in order to provide strong ideological and organizational assurances for progress in agricultural , rural , and peasant work .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Speaking about consolidating and standardizing the order of the market economy , Wu Yi emphasized : First , it is necessary to give prominence to key points , accurately pinpoint and firmly grasp conspicuous problems that seriously disturb the market order , damage industrial and agricultural production , and are harmful to the legitimate rights and interests of the producers and consumers , concentrate efforts on solving special problems , and strive to obtain visible results .  
Reform the permanent residence registration system to allow people who invest or operate businesses in the west or take part in the development of the west to keep their original residence registration .  Any individual who has a legal permanent residence in a city below the prefectural level or in a small town and has a steady job or a steady source of income may , if he wishes , apply for permanent residence registration in the township .  Encourage the proper movement of the redundant agricultural work force and proper inter-regional population circulation .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
The national agricultural work conference recently concluded in Beijing pointed out that this year , efforts will be focused on doing a good job in increasing peasants ' income and enhancing grain security , thus laying a solid foundation for economic development and social stability in the whole country .  
The rural market information system will be established and perfected .  The agricultural quality standards and monitoring system will be set up at a quicker pace .  The work of formulating and revising trade standards and local standards for agriculture will be further advanced .  
Hubei has outstanding natural conditions and rich resources .  It is nationally renowned for its scientific and educational undertakings .  With its solid industrial and agricultural foundation , it has the potential for rapid development .  
Hubei will concentrate on the development of six major industries , including high-tech industries in " Wuhan - - China 's Optical Valley , " with electronic information industry at the core , modern manufacturing industries with automotive industry at the core , raw materials industries with iron and steel industry at the core , energy industries with hydropower generation at the core , modern agricultural industries with the production of green food at the core , and tertiary industries with tourism at the core .  
In recent years , the institute has engaged in nearly 50 research projects , including those under the state 's 863 Program , projects supported financially by the state 's natural science research fund , and international cooperative research projects .  So far , it has won 11 national and provincial awards for its achievements and has become China 's major backbone research force in the field of agricultural biotechnology .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
A relatively perfect system of agricultural science and education and a system of technology dissemination have been initially instituted , the contingent of scientific and technological personnel has been steadily expanded , the basic research in the agricultural sphere and research on new high technologies have made rapid advances , and some research items have held a leading position in the world .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Li Lanqing pointed out that since the first national meeting of agricultural science and technology held in 1963 , through the unremitting efforts of the agricultural scientific and technological workers and various sectors , we have basically resolved the technological problems in terms of agricultural quantitative growth at present .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
After that , we will take another 10 to 15 years to institute a new-type agricultural scientific and technological innovative system that is suited to China 's agricultural big power status and comes up to the international advanced standards , so that China 's agricultural science and technology will be able to rise to the advanced level in the world .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
fully release the initiative and creativity of the scientific and technological personnel , peasants , and enterprises in disseminating agricultural science and technology , adopt the forms of combining the rank of professionals with peasant organizations , combining the leading role of the government and the guiding role of the markets , and combining paid services with gratuitous services , and break a new path of scientific and technological dissemination that tallies with China 's national conditions .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
Agricultural development has changed from the resource constraint of the past to the dual constraint of resources and market ; problems such as irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low comprehensive returns on agriculture , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes are becoming more conspicuous by the day , and these set new and still higher demands on the development of agricultural science and technology .  
If we are unable to achieve breakthroughs in the progress of agricultural science and technology , it will be hard to enhance the comprehensive productive forces in agriculture and agricultural competitiveness , and it will then be hard to meet the demands of all-round building of a comfortably well-off living standard .  
Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , pointed out at the close of the meeting : The Agricultural Technology Development Outline formulated by China at the beginning of the century manifests the requirements of promoting a new agricultural technological revolution put forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and is a comprehensive and systematic guideline document guiding China 's agricultural technological development in the future .  
We must regard nurturing of talents as a crucial measure and build an agricultural technology contingent formed by technological leaders , agricultural technology promotion experts , agricultural technology entrepreneurs , high-caliber peasants , and agricultural technology management cadres , thereby promoting independent , healthy , and sustained development of China 's agricultural technology undertakings .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
The party committees at all levels should fully understand the momentous and far-reaching significance of the current " study and education " activities , further integrate their thinking with the major policy decisions of the central authorities , use the idea of " three represents " to lead and assume overall responsibility for the agricultural and rural work , strengthen leadership , organize the work carefully , seek actual results , and have a good and firm grasp of the " study and education " activities conscientiously .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
Li Chunting stressed in his report : During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Shandong will continue to center its efforts around the work of increasing the income of peasants ; strive to fulfill the target of accelerating the process of agricultural modernization ; and ensure a steady growth for its agriculture , a sustained increase in the income of its peasants , and a lengthy and peaceful reign in society .  
The province will stabilize its total acreage of basic farmland at 5.33 million hectares , and its total grain output , at 40 million tonnes .  By taking the market as the guide and by focusing on the need for optimizing products , the province will develop well-marketable products of a fine quality , products for special purposes , as well as new varieties of brand-name products , products with unique features , and less-common products ; meanwhile , it will also speed up the development of a new-type agriculture , environmental-friendly foodstuffs , and organic agricultural products .  
- - Comprehensively implementing the strategy of industrializing the agricultural operation , improving the processing and transformation level of agricultural products , and enhancing the extension effect of agriculture .  The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
Yuan Longping courageously broke into the forbidden zone of breeding self-pollinating crops , an area considered worldwide as impenetrable .  He presented a fresh view on taking advantage of paddy rice heterosis , achieved a historic breakthrough in paddy rice breeding , and made an outstanding contribution to China 's grain production and the development of agricultural science .  
Responsible persons of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities , and the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps ; responsible persons of concerned ministries and departments of the party Central Committee , the National People 's Congress and the State Council ; and responsible persons of offices of leading groups of financial and agricultural departments and commissions of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas attended the meeting .  
Several decades of effort have brought dramatic changes to the Chinese countryside , and combined agricultural production capacity has taken several steps at a time consecutively .  After several thousand years , China 's troubling problem of feeding its people has finally been resolved and farmers ' lives overall have attained a level of relative comfort .  
According to Anhui province 's statistics , since the fee-to-tax reform was implemented , the agricultural two taxes and their attachments collected by the province were reduced 23.6 percent from what was collected in agricultural tax , agricultural unique product tax , township joint planning and village withdrawals before the reform was implemented .  Implementing this reform , combined with abolition of the butchery tax and rural educational fundraising raising , meant the total tax and fee burden for farmers dropped by 31 percent .  
It relieved farmers of complicated and varied tax and fee payments , and clarified bookkeeping .  In short , it implemented " one tax , one process . "  So farmers are now so enthusiastic about paying their due taxes legally that the entire county accomplished its agricultural tax collection work in just a little over 20 days , something unimaginable in the past .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
He said that in order to achieve agricultural modernization , it is necessary to increase the technological content of agriculture , make positive efforts to readjust the structure of farm production with the optimization of species , the improvement of quality and the achievement of better performance as the central tasks , energetically foster leading enterprises , and boost the successive performance of agriculture and increase peasants ' income through the promotion of " integration of companies and peasant households , " " farming on order " and other forms .  
At the same time , the proposal of these policy principles is very practicable .  For example , with respect to protecting and improving grain production capability , the ' outline ' stipulates strict execution of the basic agricultural land protection system , maintaining a dynamic equilibrium in the total amount of land under cultivation in the nation , and ensuring that by 2005 the total area of land under cultivation will not be less than 128 million hectares .  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
Lu Ming spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association : From the high plane of the modernization program , we should reexamine the importance of the question of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants at the current stage , draft agricultural policies , and coordinate other policies in light of the requirements of laying stress on , supporting , and developing agriculture .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on . 
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
Fifth , we should more effectively promote and spread major practicable farming techniques , enhance the quality of farm produce and the comprehensive agricultural efficiency , thus providing technological support for restructuring . 
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
Wu Jinglian , famous economist and standing committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , today at a news conference remarked that the large-scale lay-offs of workers that have occurred in China in recent years are inevitable reflections of the employment system and policies of a planned economy that is undergoing the process of economic transition .  The large influx of excess agricultural labor in non-agricultural industries has also made employment increasingly difficult .  Thus , improving the social environment for employment is a new solution for re-employment .  
Speaking on environmental protection during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Qu Geping said : Of all five-year plans , the draft outlines of the 10th Five-Year Plan place the greatest emphasis on environmental protection .  In addition to setting aside one special chapter - - " The Ecological Environment and Environmental Protection " - - to detail the protection plan , it also sets requirements for projects to be accomplished by the industrial , agricultural , and other sectors , thus incorporating the strategy for achieving sustainable developments with the national economic development plan .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
If we have steady agricultural development , peasants will live in happiness and rural areas will be prosperous .  If such being the case , the state will enjoy a stable situation and the world will be peaceful .  China 's history has proven this over the past several thousand years .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
He added : To achieve the " two higher " objective " and effect restructuring in the five aspects , Henan will give prominence to following eight measures in the course of comprehensively advancing economic and social development : First , build two agricultural bases , turn Henan into the country 's major high-quality wheat production and processing base , and major animal product production and processing base .  
As stressed at the session , strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing the farmers ' income must be considered as economic tasks of prime importance .  It is imperative to speed up agricultural and rural economic restructuring , energetically promote the industrialized operation of agriculture , vigorously conduct rural reforms in all fields , truly reduce the burdens on farmers , continue the help-the-poor work in rural areas , and take positive and steady steps to proceed with the urbanization program .  
He pointed out : Taking agricultural restructuring and the increase of farmers ' income as the basic target and major task of the current agricultural and rural economic work is a correct policy decision made by the central authorities after having made a thorough analysis of the situation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new period .  Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy is not only an important way to increase farmers ' income but also a strategic measure to comprehensively improve the overall quality and efficiency of agriculture and carry out agricultural modernization .  
( c ) whether the level of fee payable in respect of such private land is on a par with the level of rent payable for the industrial land leased under short term tenancy ; if so , the basis of determination by the Administration and whether the income receivable for agricultural use of the land should form a deducting factor in the fee calculating formula ?  
According to the information provided , the Xinfengjiang Reservoir plays vital and multiple roles in regulating the flow of Dongjiang , improving the environment , assuring the quality of life and supplying water for industrial and agricultural use on its lower reaches , protecting navigation , etc .  
By observing the sky , people were able to forecast seasonal changes accurately and to devise calendar to plan the agricultural activities such as sowing and reaping .  Moreover , the ancient emperors called themselves " the Son of Heaven " .  They believed that they were sent to the Earth at God 's will and thought that changes in celestial phenomena were closely linked with the fate of their reigns .  Therefore , the officials responsible for astronomical affairs had extremely high status in the society .  
Since ancient times , the Chinese population could broadly be divided into agricultural and nomadic sectors due to geographic and climatic diversities within the Chinese territories .  The agricultural land and pastoral areas were established south and north of the Great Wall respectively .  
China 's earliest royal dynasty - the Xia dynasty ( 2070-1600BC ) - first established its capital in the Henan region and during the subsequent 3,300 years more than 20 dynasties established their capitals in Henan Province . The large quantity of archaeological finds demonstrate that as early as 400,000 or 500,000 years ago humans were living in the Central Plains area and at some time between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago agricultural production had made its beginnings there during the period of Peiligang culture ( c . 7000X5000BC ) .  
The Government will resume 29 private agricultural lots with a total area of about 10,130 square metres to facilitate the construction of a primary school and a secondary school in Sheung Shui . The proposed projects aim to meet the increasing demand for primary and secondary school places in the North District .  
The participants were divided into eight panel groups to discuss specific topics in their specialized field , education and culture , business and industry , financial and monetary affairs communications reconstruction , agricultural reconstruction , social welfare , public health and urban development .  
Unfortunately more extensive development of this area has been suspended due to the corrosive properties of the hot water . The steam alone , however , is far less acid , and a feasibility study to use dry steam for agricultural and industrial purposes has been going on since 1974 . The main achievements of the project include a lumber drying kiln , a horticulture greenhouse , and a general laboratory for testing soil sterilization , cereal drying and shrimp and poultry culture .  
During the switch in the social infrastructure from an agricultural to an industrial base , embroidery has proved to be a valuable stabilizing force in cultivating the mind and preserving the cultural heritage , while at the same time earning foreign exchange for the country .  
Traditional rustic architecture dominated by red walls , goats dotted here and there in the meadows , an old lady with her hair in a bun feeding chickens , and serene village roads , are all indicative of an ancient and prosperous Chinese agricultural society .  
Topics covered included improving the aborigines ' living standards , dredging waterways in Er Chung to prevent floods , strengthening communications with people at the basic level , and stabilizing prices of agricultural products .  
Some plants from remote mountain areas can cost as much as NT $ 3-4,000 ( US $ 75-100 ) a kilo , while those gathered from riverbanks and agricultural land cost as little as NT $ 30 or 40 . Most herbs from distant areas are dried , while those grown locally are sold fresh and must be consumed within three or four days .  
These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
The majority of the first settlers were engaged in farming . The rugged terrain , and damp climate encouraged the cultivation of tea and oranges . The past 30 years have seen Taiwan evolve from an agricultural based economy to that of an industrial-based nation . Industrial development in the Taipei basin spurred the growth of many satellite communities such as Yung Ho , Chung Ho and Pan Ch'iao .  
But a strong base of agricultural success has already been firmly established . New produce such as the avocado , the new fish hatcheries and domesticated animal farms in Peishihli , and the recently planned re-cultivation of Hsiaopili have successfully taken over what began with pomelo cultivation .  
New construction of buildings and roads is a continual danger to the city 's treasured historical architecture . Tainan County is wide and level , with an area of approximately 68 miles . With the sea on one side and fertile plains on the other , Tainan has long been favored as both a fishing and agricultural center . Its fishery fleet brings in more than 30,000 tons of fish per year .  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Twenty and thirty years ago , the production of rice made up more than 75 percent of the total agricultural produce of Taiwan . In those days the word ' agriculture ' was just about synonymous with ' rice , ' " says Wang Yu-chao , director of the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan . " The ' agriculture ' that we speak of today has since been broadened in scope to include the diverse areas of farming , forestry , fishing , and animal husbandry . "  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
As mayor of Taipei and then as governor of Taiwan , whether faced with hectoring legislators or a recalcitrant citizenry , he always managed to turn dissension into harmony and get " good marks . " Many people may not know that he first earned the favorable notice of the reform-minded Mr . Chiang for a bold and substantive critical report that he made on agricultural policy as a consultant with the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
The conference summarized its discussions in 11 conclusions , aimed at an ideal agricultural system including : a structure for agricultural policy with comprehensive powers , strong and capable farmers ' organizations , autonomous price regulation , stable agriculture profits , moderate trade protection , reasonable prices for inputs , continuous use of agriculture resources , a low-pollution environment , stable growth in agriculture , hygienic and safe agricultural products , and safe and healthy rural villages .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
Specialists commonly agree that the solution lies in combining small farms into large ones to achieve economies of scale and in promotion of planned production and sales , to economically utilize agricultural resources . Moreover , modernized construction should be strengthened in the rural areas to build villages with the potential to meet the needs of the time . This will solve problems of the farming population and the farming villages simultaneously . (  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
The agricultural mission not only helps Malawi develop agriculture but also serves our foreign service community there by providing them with fresh produce and playing the role of general jacks-of-all-trades and Mr . Fix-it 's . If the car breaks down , if it has a flat tire , if the screen door 's stuck , if you need some styrofoam or nylon cord for packing , if you 're short a blanket and pillow for a guest . . . just track down a team member and you 're sure to come away satisfied .  
With the arrival of the 20th century , as Australia 's abundant agricultural , industrial and mineral resources were increasingly exploited , more and more investment was devoted to applied research in related areas , Before 1960 , when Melbourne was still the only university in the state of Victoria , faculties and departments with a practical orientation flourished in particular .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Of course this is related to our fitting in with Malaysian national policy - - to develop the east coast and to develop agriculture , " says Lin , explaining their " good luck . " Although Malaysia is an agricultural country , it only has palm oil and rubber as relatively well developed cash crops . They rely on imports for most other agricultural products like fruit , rice , and vegetables . Production of aquatic products is also low , so that agriculture has always been one of the sectors with investment incentives .  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
Unwilling to bring production : In primitive times Puli was a vast lake ; later the water disappeared , leaving a basin filled with extremely rich lake-bottom soil . This made Puli into a main agricultural center in Central Taiwan , with the major claims to fame being red sugar cane and bamboo shoots .  
Currently , in the coastal areas all around the island , smugglers are mostly bringing in agricultural products with a relatively high value , like peanuts , garlic , mushrooms , dried lilies , red beans , betel nuts , sticky rice , Chinese medicines and fish products . Beef , pork , lamb and intestines are also smuggled in , as well as rare animals like Tibetan Mastiffs .  
Water comes from heaven . " In agricultural societies , things which are filtered out with water are all organic matter that can be broken down and returned to the natural cycle . Thus , in several places in north Taiwan which are relatively short of water , the agricultural irrigation system and the town or village drainage system were linked together , so that water could be circulated and reused , thus saving water resources .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Because the ozone layer can absorb ultraviolet light from sunlight and block out most of the radiation harmful to life on earth , as the protective function of this layer is weakened , the incidence of diseases related to unltraviolet rays , such as skin cancer or cataracts , rises dramatically ; the immune systems of animals become repressed ; plant growth stagnates ; and it even leads to a drop in agricultural production and mass deaths in aquatic life .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
Kang Mu-hsiang , who applies sculptural concepts in his carving , attracts customers to his studio with a large picture of himself holding a chisel and a gouge . Tseng Chin-tsai 's sign uses the theme of a swineherd in the old agricultural society and the song " When Will You Return ? " to allude to the inevitability of suffering in human life . Here one can also find pottery studios , a studio producing mainly carvings of horses , and so on . All the color of Sanyi is concentrated in this one short street .  
Lots of people listen to the weather report every day , but you probably did n't know that the Central Weather Bureau operates an astronomical observatory which is not devoted to predicting the weather . It is responsible for calculating the precise timing of the 24 Solar Terms of the Chinese calendar every year . And after examining the data , the Ministry of the Interior includes it in the annual farmer 's almanac , distributed every year to each agricultural worker .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
When rain falls from the heavens groundwater is naturally replenished , and for thousands of years Chinese farmers have sung : " We work from sunrise / We rest at sunset / We dig wells for water / What do we care about the might of emperors ? " The ceaseless supply of groundwater bubbling up from wells enabled people to drink when they were thirsty and wash when they were dusty , and allowed agricultural society to ignore the power of emperors and self-confidently affirm that people 's value came from living on the land .  
Tea by that time had already become an international commodity . The price went through constant fluctuations , so during those years some people made money , and some people lost money . In this way , the stable system of agricultural production and commerce in previous times , as well as the systems of wholesale distribution and management , were all destroyed .  
Opposite the main entrance , the spacious farmhouse boasts a wallful of award certificates and wooden plaques from friends : 1985 Taoyuan County Top Ten Farmers ; First Place , 1994 Organic Growers ' Exhibition ; 1995 Farm Entrepreneur of the Year . Just this year , Chuang was honored with Taiwan 's highest agricultural award , the " Shen Nong " award for his " leadership role in research and promotion of organic farming methods and production of safe , high-quality vegetables . "  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
Because of agricultural crops ' short harvesting cycles , there is as yet little alternative to controlling pest outbreaks by the moderate use of pesticides , unless production methods can be changed ; but when transient insect infestations occur in gardens or in woodland-except where " wood borers " such as ghost moths ( family Hepialidae ) or goat moths ( family Cosiidae ) , which are potentially fatal to trees , are involved-forestry experts generally advise against attempting wholesale eradication with pesticides .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
After that fiasco , " investment " became a nasty word for many locals , who recoiled from betting on the economy at the very time when the economy entered an industrial boom that would last for decades . As the rest of Taiwan raced ahead , Chishan remained preserved in its rose-tinted memories of banana money . An agricultural adventurer After Ku 's father passed away his dwindling estate was split up between Ku and his siblings , thus splitting the Ku fortune into still smaller shares .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
President Chen has also instructed Taiwan 's financial and economic community that regardless of whether the US fights a quick or a protracted war , Taiwan must respond with flexibility by stabilizing the equity and currency markets and guaranteeing the supply of crude oil , agricultural raw materials , and staple commodities .  
But Liu 's father by no means encouraged Arthur to go into this field , and so he studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University . But it proved impossible to resist his natural inclinations , and he ended up in the broadcast world anyway . Liu attended National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated High School , which had a relatively lively , open atmosphere .  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices . In a time of economic recession , consumers will be able to enjoy the same standard of consumption while spending less .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers . " Technological developments in Taiwan 's agriculture have never ceased to move forward , " says Lee . With its myriad technological breakthroughs , agricultural testing institutions , experimental farms , fishery testing institutions , and private enterprises , Taiwan is one of the best in the research and development of new agricultural strains .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
In addition , to cope with competition from low-priced imported rice resulting from Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization , beginning in 2002 Wufeng began cooperating with an agricultural research station of the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) to promote the use of Tainong 71 " Yi-chuan fragrant rice . " This variety , developed by Dr . Kuo Yi-chuan , has round and robust grains , and when cooked gives off a special taro fragrance .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
With a strong foundation in agricultural research and development laid during the Japanese era , Taiwanese agriculturalists have been hard at work improving their rice stocks , employing a variety of techniques ranging from mass selection of seeds and the introduction of new varieties , to hybridization and mutation breeding .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Over time , with the constant expansion and division of academic disciplines , new units were established , including divisions of medicine , engineering , and agricultural science , as well as graduate institutes of tropical medicine , southern civilization , and southern resources . By the time Japanese rule ended in 1945 , the university had five academic divisions , a preparatory school , three graduate institutes , and 115 academic chairs , with 378 full-time academic personnel , 123 part-time personnel and 382 students .  
When NTU absorbed the Agricultural Division of TIU , it changed its name to the College of Agriculture ( CoA ) . With seven academic departments it was NTU 's largest college . Later , the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was split into two , and the mechanical engineering group in the agricultural engineering department became a separate department . The CoA gradually expanded to 12 departments .  
Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach . Can this approach , along with the increasingly successful development of ecotourism , help create a new future for the controversial highland farming industry ?  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) on nuclear weapons , and all its atomic programs are based on " peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical , agricultural and energy generation purposes " and " within the framework of the internationally recognized absolute rights of any country "  
Reforms have concentrated on promoting sound macroeconomic policies , price liberalization , an increased role for the private sector coupled with a more focused role for the public sector , as well as measures to increase agricultural production .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
Growing environmental awareness worldwide has stimulated the development of a complex range of regulations and institutional mechanisms aimed at controlling the adverse environmental effects of industrial and agricultural production .  
Cognizant of urban transition as an irreversible demographic , economic and societal process which can be a major instrument for securing balanced economic and spatial development and relieve the severe pressure on scarce agricultural land ,  
The foregoing review has demonstrated the vital importance of groundwater whether confined or not , as a source of fresh water for both human consumption and for industrial and agricultural use .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
Initially , this system covered all employees in the nonagricultural activities of the private and social sectors and the employed in the socially owned agricultural sector , whereas later on it expanded to include active individual farmers as well .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
One form of non-governmental organization follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference has thus been a continuing constructive critique of SARD concepts , emphasizing such elements as democracy , participation , equitable access to resources , local solutions , cultural values , social justice and equity , and ecological agricultural systems often adapted from traditional methods .  
It seeks to foster development of sustainable agricultural production systems and to ensure that the following elements of sustainability are incorporated in the formulation and implementation of Bank-financed projects : increased and stabilized productivity ; rational use of natural resources ; enhancement of the quality of life and the environment ; and intergenerational equity .  
The environmental problems have been aggravated by agricultural policies - which have encouraged increasing production of some commodities on fragile lands and the use of inappropriate farm practices - and the lack of markets to value environmental public goods or the failures of some markets to internalize environmental costs and benefits within farmers ' decision-making .  
In all countries , policies oriented towards promoting food and agricultural production and rural development and raising or maintaining farm incomes , while protecting the natural resource base , need to be coherent , consistent and mutually supportive ;  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
WMO also organized jointly with EPPO and NAPPO symposia and workshops to give practical training in the use of meteorological data in the fight against pest and diseases , in reducing the level of undesired chemicals and in improving the quality of agricultural produce .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
Hundreds of settlements have been set on fire and destroyed ; government institutions , agricultural facilities and industrial enterprises , medical and consumer services , educational establishments , transport , power and water supply infrastructure and other important amenities have been plundered ; and the communications of the Azerbaijani State have been disrupted .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
The impact on women varies from the need to fit additional work into an already full and tiring day , to taking on the agricultural work of an absent husband , to additional responsibilities on a husband 's enlarged plot or new production scheme , to the loss of an independent income from her personal plot which has been taken over for family production .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
This has been a critical step forward in the context of translating project-induced increases in agricultural productivity and often a strengthened resource base into adequate diets for rural poor households .  
In the rural areas , where they are predominantly located in most of the developing regions except Latin America , they are the landless or near-landless illiterate agricultural workers , nomads , fishermen , pastoralists and forest dwellers who eke out a subsistence income from seasonal agricultural employment or from marginal lands and forests or from low-income non-farm work .  
Aware of the need to recognize the importance of an understanding of gender issues within all areas of agricultural , social , economic , environmental and political life in order to achieve a balanced division of roles and responsibilities and an equitable access to resources and to the benefits of development ,  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
Such measures vary in range : pricing policies for agricultural inputs required by small farmers in raising their production ; policies regarding access to small credit facilities ; special measures required to make education accessible to children born in remote rural areas who participate in seasonal agricultural activities alongside adults ; elimination of legislative and bureaucratic barriers to the informal sector .  
In assessing costs for example of human resource development investments , the family decision-making structure will take into account inhibiting as well as motivating factors affecting their decisions to invest time in the schooling of girls , the opportunity costs of lost household or other ( e.g . agricultural , smallholding or commercial ) labour , or cultural / psychological stress on individuals as a consequence of non-traditional occupational or " career " choices .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .

NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
Cuba is not immune to the ideological effect of institutions such as self-employment , the agricultural and livestock market and , on another scale , foreign enterprises , with the concomitant national and foreign businessmen connected with the mixed import and export economy .  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend , as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations .  
To enable the General Assembly to give appropriate support to that Summit , the Group of 77 and China urgently requested the inclusion of an additional sub-item , to be entitled " Food and sustainable agricultural development " , under item 95 , Sustainable development and international economic cooperation , and to be considered in its entirety by the Second Committee .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
The Committee was informed that the General Assembly , at its 55th plenary meeting on 10 November 1995 , decided to allocate to the Second Committee an additional sub-item entitled " Food and sustainable agricultural development " as sub-item ( k ) of agenda item 95 and the Committee agreed to begin its consideration of the new sub-item together with the scheduled cluster on Thursday , 16 November 1995 .  
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reported that the 1995 agricultural season has been significantly more successful than had been anticipated , in part because of both favourable weather conditions and the timely provision of agricultural support by the international donor community .  
The Committee noted that recent spin-offs of space technology included a light-weight metal cutter for emergency rescue operations , an automotive assembly fastener , a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide , a portable ultraviolet indicator , a new greenhouse for agricultural crops , new foods and medicines and honeycomb fireproof insulation material .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
They engaged in such hostile and provocative actions as breaking the sound barrier over civilian sites , dropping heat flares over agricultural land and intercepting and provoking Iraqi civilian vessels .  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
However , administered or indicative maximum or minimum prices still exist in many countries of the region for selected agricultural exports or basic foodstuffs with the rationale of protecting the interests of the small farmers and the poor .  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
In terms of the poor penetration of agricultural areas that required specialized types of services , the Working Group stated that opportunities existed to provide alternative services such as radio communication systems , space or ground based .  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
Industry remains a vital instrument for economic and social progress , facilitating employment generation , contributing fundamentally to productivity growth and technological change , enabling the creation of dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors , and contributing to foreign-exchange earnings .  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
The presence of newly planted mines along some secondary roads which were previously considered safe is raising serious concerns among humanitarian agencies responsible for the distribution of agricultural assistance .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
These programmes have been accompanied by specific measures of equal importance dealing with social security , including in particular the reform of the industrial accident and occupational disease scheme , which has produced substantial improvements both in the extent of the cover and benefits , especially those paid to widows and orphans , and in the improvements made in the social security system in the agricultural sector . 
From the standpoint of improvement of agricultural productivity the optimal management of public land constitutes a priority means of substantially raising the contribution of such land to increased output and helping , by a multiplier effect , to disseminate advanced techniques .  Accordingly , a reform of the methods of managing this national land has been adopted after widespread national consultation .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
In so saying , we acknowledge that many African countries have taken very considerable steps to improve their level of social and economic development , including undertaking structural economic reform to correct economic imbalances , increasing the priority given to social expenditures , providing social safety nets , improving the rights of women and children , protecting the environment , enhancing agricultural production and marketing processes , increasing food security and embracing democratic processes , as well as the introduction of good governance .  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
Notwithstanding the modest level of funding that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) has received for activities in this sector , the total collapse of the rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , WFP has had remarkable success in assisting in the relaunching of food production .  
Deeply concerned at the widespread and disastrous consequences of the economic sanctions imposed against Burundi for the national economy , public finances and agricultural production and for the health and the education , at all levels , of its population ,  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Likewise , suburban sprawl , which has led to increased consumption of fossil fuel through extended commuting , disturbs the fragile ecosystems and permanently removes prime arable land from agricultural production .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Implementation is usually directed towards both increasing economic opportunity - for example , through land reform and land rehabilitation , strengthening the agricultural sector , education and training , job creation , and access to seed capital - and towards providing a social safety net , through the provision of shelter and support to community groups and broad participation in decision-making .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
The most dangerous agricultural pest , the pink mealy bug , is being controlled by bio-control agents a hybrid beetle and a parasitic wasp .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Concern about slack growth and mounting social problems led the Government to decide early in March on a new economic orientation , including promotion of investment and elimination of all obstacles to investment by Lebanese and foreigners ; protection of agriculture through limiting imports of competing agricultural products ; and selection and protection of competitive industries , which have an export potential , which will be supported to ensure increased productivity .  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
Recognizing , however , the importance of agricultural development no only for people living in rural areas but as an engine of growth , the Bank had formulated during the past year a new action plan for rural development , designed to address current problems and to provide a new and dynamic framework for future Bank activities in that area .  The plan had just been presented to the Bank 's Board of Directors .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
This is fully in line with the predominant role of the agricultural sector in African economies , the potential for long-term comparative advantage of agro-based production , the multiple linkages between the industrial and agricultural sectors and their potential socioeconomic / economic impact through SMEs and informal-sector activities , particularly in rural areas .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
Despite the collapse of rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , a number of projects are being implemented to support an increase in overall food production among settled farming communities , nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists , returnees and vulnerable groups .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
The speaker listed several issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( iv ) trade in services .  
The speaker listed a number of issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) debt burden ; ( iv ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( v ) trade in services .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
While India is forging ahead with its policy of economic reform and liberalization , public policy is being re-oriented towards supporting agricultural growth , building up infrastructure and ensuring universal access to basic minimum services like health , education , drinking water , food and nutrition , shelter and so on .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Since rural energy problems persist and energy is not playing its full role as a motor for rural development , the following issues have emerged as complementary priorities or as new areas of focus : ( a ) more emphasis on the micro or household level ; ( b ) renewed interest in eco-village projects , solar villages etc . ; ( c ) promotion of innovative financial schemes to promote small businesses ; and ( d ) emphasis on the impact of rural energy on agricultural productivity .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .

These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
In satellite agrometeorology , work is continuing to provide a prompt service to users at different hierarchical levels , furnishing information on the condition of agricultural sown crops which is obtained by processing and interpreting data received from meteorological satellites .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
UNTMIH paved the way for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to Haiti 's long-term development , meshing security concerns with technical assistance and a whole range of environmental , agricultural , educational and administrative reform programmes .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
According to article III of its Memorandum and Articles of Association , the main objectives of the Centre are to develop well researched policy options on land reform , rural development and agricultural reform to influence the policies of a future administration ; to facilitate the analysis of existing policies and alternative policy proposals relating to this sector ; to provide options for the reorientation of policy-making towards a democratic order ; to collect data and develop and manage a comprehensive information system concerning land and agricultural issues and including all existing research .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
In South-East Asia strong economic growth along with a relatively large and rapidly expanding population base has attracted a great deal of interest from Western investors in all areas of the agricultural and food chain , especially in processing and distribution .  Although the level of imports in most cases is relatively low for processed horticultural products , in some markets ( e.g .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
Recently , many developing countries have abandoned the policy of supporting industrialization by maintaining agricultural prices low across the board and left prices to be determined on the market , expecting that resources would thus be allocated efficiently and market opportunities would be exploited .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
In order to curb rapid loss of biodiversity , the deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled so as to reverse the serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
To curb rapid loss of biodiversity , deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled to reverse the continuing serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
There were fewer women than men in the labour force , mainly because many women were engaged in child rearing , and much of the unpaid female work in the agricultural sector was not generally recorded as economic activity .  
According to a survey commissioned by the Office for Rural Development in 1993 , rural women employed in agricultural activities worked an average of 12 hours and 58 minutes a day , of which a mere 4 hours were devoted to household management and domestic work .  
In a similar vein , many agricultural products are controlled ( although this is changing rapidly ) with , for example , fixed or minimum or maximum prices , central marketing councils , and surplus removal schemes .  
Before the crisis , while the north remained underdeveloped and sparsely populated , almost all agricultural , manufacturing , trade and tourism , as well as educational and cultural activities , were concentrated inside or within a few kilometres of Plymouth .  
The system of municipal and prefectural agricultural committees , which played a central role in agricultural land reform as the primary administrative organization , was also revised .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
The concentration of shifting cultivators on a smaller or poorer resource base typically sets in motion a downward spiral of reduced agricultural productivity , increased forest depletion and worsened rural poverty , as cropland fallow periods are shortened and soil fertility declines .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
For example , in Thailand , women working on family-owned land under contract to multinational companies earned cash income for the first time after years of unpaid labour in intensive rice cultivation . 15 However , the vertical integration of the agricultural sector which comes with the involvement of multinational corporations makes rural household food security vulnerable to market fluctuations . 
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
In spite of temporary difficulties caused by the destruction of health and education facilities and industrial and agricultural infrastructure as a result of the natural disasters of recent successive years , our people are full of courage and are firmly convinced that under the Great Leader and our social system they can repair the damage in the shortest possible time and build a rich and strong country .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
The factors driving these conflicts which the Seminar identified showed why internal conflicts clearly predominate : ethnic rivalries , general decline in the rule of law , democratic shortcomings on the part of the political authorities , defective governance policies , poverty and underdevelopment , identity-based political demands , politicization of ethnicity , shortcomings in reintegrating former combatants , lack of access to agricultural land , economic difficulties and other factors .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
The Board observed that , in the short to medium term , improved agricultural performance offered many of the least developed countries the most effective way to raise economic growth rates and expand and diversify exports .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .  
Thus , Africas struggle to achieve rapid economic transformation will be lost or won depending on how effectively industrial development is linked with agricultural development through enhanced manufacturing value added , productivity and competitiveness , with an accent on employment and income generation .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Commodities continue to provide an important economic starting base : they have a high value-added component ; agricultural commodities are an important source of employment and offer scope for anti-poverty campaigns ; and agriculture frequently acts as a buffer against economic problems and allows the return to rural areas of urban unemployed , as in the current crisis .  
While its close-knit families and strong agricultural base had enabled Thailand to weather the 1997 financial crisis , the existing social safety nets had been severely tested and the crisis had served as a reminder that social development could not be treated as secondary to economic development .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
Statistics showed that female-headed households constituted 47 per cent of the rural and 29 per cent of the urban population living below the poverty line , and that women represented a disproportionate share of the agricultural labour force , but controlled only 38 per cent of its operations . 
With regard to the right to an adequate standard of living , the Syrian Arab Republic has shown special concern for the agricultural sector in view of its important role in the economic development process , since it constitutes the principal source of every individual 's vital requirements such as food and clothing .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
The Chinese trajectory , however , where these factors are absent , also points to the decisive role of State capacity in the virtuous growth path that accompanied gradual and uneven institutional reforms over a period of two decades ( as exemplified in the agricultural reforms , the open-door policy , the transitional dual-track regime in industry and the change in the fiscal system Chavance , forthcoming in 2000 ) .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
As soon as a list is drawn up , humanitarian items such as foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals and medical supplies , as well as basic or standard medical and agricultural equipment and educational items , will no longer be submitted to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for approval .  
In developing countries , atomic energy with its multiple applications in power generation , improving health standards , enhancing the quality and quantity of agricultural yields , pest controls and water resources management is seen as the key to a better future .  
It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
The theme From farm to factory for a better future embodies my firm belief that Africa , with its endowment of diverse agricultural resources , most of which are industrial raw materials that could be transformed to provide adequate food for the peoples of Africa , could simultaneously improve agricultural productivity , as well as increase utilization of its manufacturing capacity for food security .  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
A subsequent project identified the major causes for erosion and the high sedimentation of the Rewa River , and elaborated a detailed programme combining legal aspects , flood control , river regulation and appropriate land management practices for sustainable development of agricultural lands .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
the expressed satisfaction of policy makers and authorities with the quality of services and advice rendered in connection with rural development , agricultural policies , industrial competitiveness , entrepreneurial development and energy integration and management , as well as with the contribution to enhanced coordination and collaboration with regional organizations and bodies . 19.129 During the biennium 20002001 , the following outputs will be delivered : 
Having recognized that limited access to credit by SMEs is a major constraint on production and growth , many Governments directed public funds to SMEs through specialized financial institutions , such as agricultural and industrial development banks .  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Formal technical presentations during the first of the three sessions focused on the role of remote sensing in achieving national food security , mapping from space , agricultural applications of small satellites , as well as recent trends in remote sensing and meteorological and global navigation satellite systems .  
The Conference noted that two principal benefits that effective sharing of information would allow were ( a ) the ready retrieval of information on demonstration projects that could raise the awareness of decision makers ; and ( b ) the relative ease for countries in the region to carry out comparisons of operational agricultural methodologies in order to make decisions that would improve the effectiveness of their national programmes .  
In light of increased demand for urban and related infrastructure developments , Luxembourg has developed regional and national land management planning schemes so as to set aside land for the exclusive use of agricultural production .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
At the national level , poverty eradication was the official objective of the ninth fiveyear plan , which included decentralization , agricultural development and integrated agroforestry development .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
The objective is to enable African countries to achieve economic and social development through accelerated human and institutional capacity development as well as agricultural and private sector development .  
Given the limited size of the domestic market and the unstable conditions of the international market , the major difficulty faced by Viet Nams agricultural sector is to find markets for its increased production .  
A major reason for the limited growth of agricultural trade has been protection : bound tariffs on agricultural products are , on average , at the same level as bound tariffs on industrial products 50 years ago .  
This vast territory which has immense natural ( mineral , agricultural , forestry , energy and other ) resources continues to have some of the lowest social indicators in the world and is classified among the poorest countries in the world . 
FAO designed a regional project on increasing rural womens food productivity through improved agricultural technology transfer and adoption in Africa , involving relevant United Nations agencies and selected countries in the region .  
It also imposed harsh restrictions that prevented the population living under occupation from farming and benefiting from its agricultural land , and destroyed mature , productive trees .  
This concerned , inter alia , enhanced agricultural production ; increasing value of education systems ; improving the quality of health care and contribution to good governance ( e.g . local institutions often play a vital role in improving post-conflict situations ) .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Faced with the continuing low price of wool , the Department of Agriculture is endeavouring to encourage agricultural diversification , while programmes related to wool production and marketing continue to be a major focus , among them the Agricultural Subsistence and Incentive Scheme , designed to provide financial support and to assist in the improvement of existing farming operations or the development of new farm-based enterprises and the Pasture Improvement Programme .  
Recognizing that agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa required a radical shift from traditional thinking and approaches , coupled with in-depth empirical understanding of local environmental and socio-economic conditions , WARDA began to develop technologies that were adapted to the sub-Saharan Africa environment without modifying that environment to fit the technology .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
These included : the worsening of the food security problem ; the structural difficulty of achieving competitiveness within the current international agricultural markets ; and the strong dependency on exports from this sector for the acquisition of hard currency .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
In the long term , the agricultural production base of developing countries should be improved , and in the short term , bilateral and multilateral food aid schemes should be strengthened .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
For the majority of the CEE region countries not so affected by direct desertification but faced by land degradation and so on , the major tasks are , inter alia , to establish and maintain the optimum proportions of arable land , meadows , pastures , forests and water areas in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and the capacity of the environment , to decrease over-cultivation of agricultural land through selective afforestation , bio-corridors or establishment of grasslands .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas , with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being , and in this regard encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;

Data received from the SAC-C satellite are used to study the terrestrial and marine environment , assess desertification , monitor flooding , forecast agricultural production , monitor the atmospheric temperature and vapour content of water with a view to determining the variability of the atmospheric structure , perform measurements of the geomagnetic field with the same level of accuracy attained by observatories , measure atmospheric space radiation and its effects on advanced electronic components , determine the migratory route of the southern right whale and verify methods used in determining satellite attitude and velocity .  
The countrys size and economic dimensions , with a variety of climate characteristics , large areas with agricultural activity , some highly concentrated areas of population and industrial production , and the largest area of tropical forest in the world , make evident the importance of weather and climate forecasting for Brazil .  
When chickens began to die in large numbers , the owner of the farm made an immediate report to the epidemic prevention section at the basic level .  As soon as preliminary diagnosis revealed possible cases of bird flu , the samples were immediately sent to the provincial agricultural committee and soon confirmed as suspected cases .  
Up to now , 34 cities and counties in this province are listed as coastal open economy cities and counties , covering 44% of the whole province 's total area , among which , there are 7 national level development zones of various kinds and some provincial level economic development zones and provincial level agricultural development zones as well .  
An official from the Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Department said that , since 1994 the number of " three-capital " enterprises that have been approved by the agricultural system of Jiangsu province has exceeded 500 , and the amount of foreign capital being put to use was more than 700-million US dollars , which represented threefold and sevenfold increases , respectively , over the years before 1993 .  
For a future period of time , China will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in new agricultural technology , comprehensive development of land resources , and such basic industries and pillar industries as water conservation , energy , transportation , important raw materials , machinery and electronics , mining , etc . and will encourage foreign businessmen to employ new high level technology to participate in the technical transformation of China 's enterprises  
Wuhan , in Hubei province , located in the center of China 's interior , will , in the future , put emphasis on utilizing foreign capital in the areas of the high-tech industry , basic industries , infrastructure construction , agricultural development , etc .  
Gross domestic output values reached 73-billion yuan in 1995 , increasing by 4 times compared with 1978 , before the reform and opening up .  The average living expenses and income of city and township residents reached 4053 yuan , and the average pure income of peasants reached 1554 yuan .  The total industrial and agricultural output value was 144-billion yuan , among which the former was 120.1-billion yuan .  Third industry output values reached 24.7-billion yuan , accounting for 33% of the gross domestic output value .  
According to data provided by the Guangzhou Statistics Office , last year , Guangzhou completed a gross domestic product of 144.584-billion yuan ; completed industrial added values of 57.348-billion yuan ; agricultural added values of 8.075-billion yuan ; fixed asset investments of 65.545-billion yuan ; total social consumable retail amounts of 64.432-billion yuan ; foreign trade export values of 6.513-billion US dollars ; actual utilized foreign investments of 2.6-billion US dollars ; and a retail goods price index increase of 4.3% .  
Laiwu City of Shandong Province has established a cell structure cultivation center inside the agricultural new high level technology development and model zones , to introduce and tame improved breeds of nurseries , flowers and vegetables from home and abroad .  
A government official of Shandong Province told this reporter that this province established agricultural new high level technology development and model zones beginning in 1992 , whose main purpose is to accelerate the transformation of agricultural new high level technology achievements through introducing agricultural new high level technologies from home and abroad to carry out development in order to provide effective models for agricultural production and rural economy development to promote the transformation of traditional agriculture into modern agriculture .  
In the agricultural new high level technology development and model zone of Zibo City in the Zhangdian District , plan to establish a agricultural scientific research training institute , a breeding area for improved agricultural varieties , an organic vegetable area , a quality orchard , the fine stock breeding farm , etc .  
In order to satisfy the requirements of the continuously expanding overseas markets , various areas of Guangdong have adjusted to local conditions and selected famous , special and improved varieties , and have built up more than 2,000 agricultural export merchandise production and processing bases .  
The entire province has actually utilized foreign funds of nearly 1-billion US dollars , and has established a large number of extroverted agricultural " three capital " enterprises which combine agriculture , industry , trade and technology and integrate manufacturing , supply and marketing , and through foreign merchants sales channels , it has also expanded its export of agricultural products .  
In the 20th century , following the great agricultural development that occurred between the late 1970s and early 1980s , and the rapid development during the mid-1980s of light industries such as textiles and home appliances , as well as the tertiary industries , and with all the accelerated developments in infrastructure and basic industries that were seen during the 1990s , countless problems have gradually seen their solution in China .  
Joining the WTO will help China to import in appropriate amounts agricultural staple products for which land resources are the main production element and in which China lacks relative advantage , and also to export labor-intensive agricultural products such as fruit , vegetables , and animal and aquatic products .  This will help in our restructuring of crop cultivation and stock breeding in agriculture and in improving the economic returns of agriculture .  
For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
The import of advanced technology and varieties such as mechanized stockraising , enclosed fish-rearing , the processing , storage , and preserving of agricultural produce , foodstuff processing , covering young plants with plastic film , and introduction of fine seed strains has markedly enhanced the level of modernization of China 's agriculture and grain production .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
the people of the whole country have expressed an ardent wish to build a prosperous nation through science and education and a strong country through knowledge ; the whole country 's industrial and agricultural structures have been undergoing major readjustment ; the enterprises have been engaged in technical innovation ;  
Meanwhile , the " Opinions " has also put forward concrete views on how people 's courts can successfully provide a legal guarantee for both the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the development of the rural economy , standardize the financial order according to the law , guard against and avert financial risks , protect intellectual property rights , and provide a guarantee for a sound implementation of the strategy of carrying out a large-scale development in China 's western region .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
Proceeding from the special needs of the economic and social development in China 's western region , we should lay stress on the spread and application of improved varieties of agricultural products , dry farming and water-economizing farming , a comprehensive utilization of resources , new materials and new energies , and advanced technologies in the aspect of ecological environmental protection .  
With the establishment of the market economic system , the change of the macroeconomic situation and , the increase of the total national economic strength , the not high enough quality of the economy in Beijing 's suburbs , its weak ability to adapt to changes , and its insufficient staying power for development are manifesting themselves ever more clearly , and they are becoming the important factors restricting Beijing 's agricultural and rural development .  1 .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
They tried 290 cases of selling food below sanitary standards or poisonous harmful food , products below safety standards , counterfeit medicine , as well as counterfeit and bad quality agricultural chemicals , animal medicine , chemical fertilizers , and seeds , an increase of 24 percent over the previous year , involving the punishment of 267 criminals .  
In the economic and trade sphere , we should positively strive to set up the ' Fujian Experimental Zone for Economic Cooperation Across the Straits ' at an early date , continue to run the existing Taiwan-funded enterprises properly , fully exercise the demonstrative role of the Taiwan investment zone , accelerate the construction of the cross-strait agricultural cooperative experimental zone , have a good grasp of the pilot project of direct sea navigation , and positively explore the new path for direct trade across the straits .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
Article 24 In places where industrial wastewater and urban sewage are used for irrigation , the agricultural authority of local people 's governments at or above the county level shall organize regular monitoring of the quality of water used for irrigation and the irrigated soil and farm produce and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the pollution of soil , underground water , and farm produce .  
Chen Xiwen has long been involved in agricultural economic theory and policy research .  He worked on drafting documents for the central government regarding problems of farming villages .  He wrote more than 10 books about this subject .  He also published more than 150 dissertations and research reports .  He is an expert in this field .  
It is not just in agriculture .  Improving agricultural quality and raising the quality of farming products is based on the attitude of national economic smoothness and lasting development .  Improving farmers ' income is the basic difference from the past .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
The western region should energetically develop a pillar industry and competitive products , strive to develop new products , and form an agricultural product processing system focusing on the production of grain and cereal oil products , meat products , fruit and vegetable products , and traditional Chinese medicinal herb products with local distinguishing features and national characteristics .  
It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
In particular , the eastern coastal areas should make efforts to establish the socialist market economy before other areas , realize the goal for the reform and development of the state-owned enterprises before other areas , complete the readjustment of the economic structure , and optimize and upgrade the industry before other areas , and realize basic agricultural modernization before other areas .  In short , they should work hard to realize modernization before other areas and make greater contribution to building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
While inspecting rural areas in Shaanxi recently , Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau , member of the Secretariat , and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : This is a crucial year in the new stage of China 's agricultural and rural economic development .  After consecutive years of bumper harvests , the agriculture sector is faced with the heavy tasks of restructuring , raising efficiency , and raising peasants ' income .  Therefore , it is of vital significance to do our job well in agriculture and rural areas .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
With the driving force of the overseas Chinese , this city achieved uncommon , vigorous , and rapid growth .  In ten years the total value of industrial and agricultural output grew 90-fold , and their overall economic strength jumped from being near the last in the province to one of the top three .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .  
While vigorously developing agriculture , the DPRK party and government have actively developed the agricultural sideline production and encouraged the people to plant mulberries to raise silkworms and to raise fish and pigs with a view to improving the people 's consumption .  In the meantime , the party and government have launched a nationwide lecture on popular science knowledge to disseminate the knowledge of growing cash crops and breeding animals with economic value .  
With a high forest acreage and abundant hydroelectric resources , it has favorable natural conditions and resources for economic development .  Its annual average agricultural output is three times the residents ' total demand .  It is June now , and waves of golden wheat can be seen everywhere in fields of rich black soil .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
A pertinent expert of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that some difficulties and problems still existed in the agricultural and rural economic operations at present .  The comparatively conspicuous ones included the relatively great impacts of drought , plant diseases , and insect pests on crops , the continued low prices of most agricultural products , the relatively numerous difficulties confronting the development of township and town enterprises , and so on .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
Human society 's change from the pastoral civilization to agricultural civilization and from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization was the qualitative leap of the human social and economic development after the structural adjustments were repeatedly accumulated to a certain stage .  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
In the New Year editorial , the DPRK stated that it would , in the new year , " streamline the current economic foundation , carry out comprehensive transformation of the economy with modern technologies and methods , step up the building of power , coal , metallurgy , rail transport sectors , increase agricultural production , develop the light industry , and raise the people 's living standards . "  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
We hope grassroots cadres , peasants , and herdsmen of all agricultural and pastoral areas across the autonomous region will enhance their sense of catching up with and surpassing other regions .  We hope they will conscientiously learn from the experience gained and measures taken by Deqen village and other advanced villages , and further unfold the vigorous campaign of learning from , catching up with , and striving to be the advanced .  
We hope various levels of party committees and governments across the autonomous region will earnestly put into effect the party 's policies toward agricultural and pastoral areas and unite and lead the broad masses of cadres to develop production , improve living standards , " bring social order out of chaos , " and " tackle problems caused by stupidity , " so that our region will advance by leaps and bounds and achieve prolonged political stability .  
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
The vast numbers of rural grass-roots cadres should practice a good work style and lead the broad masses of peasants to push ahead strategic adjustments of the agricultural and rural economic structures , and help peasants increase their incomes and live a happy life .  
By checking and taking inventory of the stock and figuring out the bottom line , it provides an accurate and reliable basis for helping the state to formulate a macro regulation and control policy with regard to grain production and circulation and to actively promote the readjustment of the agricultural structure and increase the peasants ' income , and we can then help to ensure the timely transfer and proper utilization of the state 's grain stockpile when needed .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
As a result , agriculture was generally regarded as an " inferior " industry .  After liberalized reforms , although agriculture and the rural economies have developed rapidly , the issue of " inferiority " has not been fundamentally solved .  In addition to insufficient inputs into agriculture by the government , agriculture was restricted by both natural and market risks , and agricultural conditions increasingly deteriorated .  
After our WTO entry , China , as a member country of the World Trade Organization , will enjoy multilateral , unconditional and stable most-favored nation treatment .  When we become involved in a trade dispute involving agriculture products , we can rely on the WTO dispute settlement mechanism to reach a more fair and reasonable solution , and this will reduce such unfair treatment as non-tariff restrictions aimed at Chinese agricultural exports by other countries .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
After our WTO entry , our agricultural product markets and agricultural key element markets will be tied to the international market , and this will help us learn from others , introduce competitive mechanisms and regulations of the international market , and accelerate a sound and complete market system and operational mechanism for agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  
At the same time , because various non-tariff measures will be prohibited , our country can not employ traditional protective measures to protect domestic markets for agricultural products .  We can only learn and explore " the green box policy " with which we are unfamiliar , and , in certain regards , do not have the proper conditions to employ .  Thus , we will be in a unfavorable position to employ trade protection for our agricultural products .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
This requires us to first establish the focal points for the construction of large scale agricultural wholesale markets and specialized wholesale markets in cities and towns , supporting it by constructing market centers to connect the numerous peasants , and completing the whole chain by constructing such key elements of the market as capital , information , technology and labor forces , to form a unified market system in cities and towns that will ensure smooth circulation of goods between cities and towns .  
At this time , we must do an outstanding job on the following key links : first , we must entirely eliminate market barriers to realize self-motivated commodity trading and free commodity circulation and to ensure timely and rapid transportation of domestic agricultural products to the international market .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
Given that the degree of marketization is increasing all the time , and agricultural development is shifting from being mainly constrained by resources to being doubly constrained by resources and demand , structural contradictions are extremely conspicuous , relative surpluses of a phased and structural nature have emerged in agricultural products , sales are sluggish , prices have fallen , and the comparative returns on agriculture have declined year by year .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
Hence , the whole process of this study and education drive must be based on arming the rural grassroots cadres with the important thinking on " three represents " ; in particular , it is essential to strengthen their concept of wholeheartedly serving the people , improve their ability to carry out agricultural restructuring and develop rural economy , strengthen their ability to do mass work well in the new situation , and enhance their consciousness of persistently " grasping things with both hands , and firmly with both hands . "  
In developed countries , the proportion of laborers engaged in agricultural production is less than 5 percent , but it is as high as 50 percent in China . In the vast rural areas , the phenomenon of insufficient employment among the peasants is relatively common , so it is a pressing task to readjust agricultural and rural economic structures and do a good job of transferring surplus rural labor forces .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
set things right in matters ranging from theory to practice ; carried out and acted in the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; lost no time in shifting the focus of party work to economic construction ; restored and developed industrial , agricultural , scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings that had been disrupted by the " Great Cultural Revolution " ; revived and carried forward the fine traditions of the party ; and consolidated and developed political stability and unity in Jilin Province .  
Currently it is necessary to pay great attention to several conspicuous problems that have a direct bearing on the immediate interests of the broad masses of the people , have provoked a strong reaction from the masses , and have caused serious harm to society .  Measures to be taken primarily in this respect are : cracking down on the production and sale of counterfeit goods and shoddy goods , with an emphasis on foodstuffs , medicines , agricultural materials , cotton , and assembled vehicles ;  
To properly accomplish the economic rural restructuring in our country , we must clearly understand and master the regularity in the evolution of agricultural and the rural economic structure , and then seize the key points based on such understanding , thus making advances in an orderly way .  
Since the 1980 ' s , the central government has practiced a series of preferential policies toward Tibet , which include the agricultural tax exemption for the agricultural and pastoral areas in recuperation and the abolition of planned purchases and quota purchases of agricultural , animal , special , and local products by the state ;  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .  
Experts attending the meeting unanimously held : The research project " China 's Agricultural Practice and Development " systematically studied and expounded the whole process of agricultural changes and development in China over thousands of years , comprehensively displayed the huge achievements in China 's agriculture , analyzed the problems appearing in China 's agricultural practice , summed up positive and negative experiences , revealed the objective laws governing the development of agriculture , and put forward the ideas and recommendations on speeding up China 's agricultural development .  
At present , every locality , on the basis of summing-up and applying successful experiences , is further implementing the demands of " three represents " for the construction of party grassroots organizations , making efforts to heighten the focus and fighting force of the rural grassroots organizations , comprehensively enhancing the overall quality of rural grassroots cadres , and providing solid and forceful ideological and organizational guarantees so that good work can be done on agricultural and rural tasks under the new conditions that confront us .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
Long Yongtu , vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and the ministry 's chief WTO negotiator , once flew into a rage over an unreasonable demand by some developed member nations that China protect its agricultural products at the 5 percent level , as do the developed countries .  He fumed , " Why deprive us of the right to protect our peasants ? "  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
We must securely grasp the developmental characteristics of the farming and animal husbandry industries and of the industries in countrysides and towns , adjust economic structures in agricultural and pastoral industries , which , after all , are the main threads of our work ; revolve around increasing the incomes of peasants and animal herders , which is the core concern ; and promote overall economic and social developmental progress in impoverished areas .  
Meanwhile , the 10th Five-Year Plan for Sci-Tech Development has clearly defined the following concrete goals for China 's sci-tech development : First , we should greatly improve our industrial level and international competitiveness .  We should ensure that the technical level of the major domains of our agricultural , industrial , and service sectors would be improved to the same level as enjoyed by advanced countries in the mid-1990s .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
On 19 June , the Chinese government officially retaliated against Japan for adopting a policy on 23 April that restricted imports of Chinese green onions and some other Chinese agricultural products .  It announced that in the near future it would impose special tariffs on imports of three types of Japanese-produced products : automobiles , wireless mobile and car phones and air conditioners .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
The session reached a comprehensive consensus on the 12 questions left over from the multilateral talks , including agricultural and industrial subsidies , trade rights , a transitional review mechanism on China , and other important issues , Long Yongtu said , adding that the political and substantial questions related to China 's accession to the WTO have been resolved . 
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
This year the main effort will be devoted to resolving five prominent problems that directly damage the masses ' vital interests , which arouse strong reaction in society , and in which the masses can participate to a high degree : First , crack down on the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and inferior goods , with the focus on foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals , agricultural production materials , cotton , and assembled motor vehicles ;  
3 .  The use of administrative review , approval , and licensing mechanisms , the conditional sale or sales promotion of products , and forcing agricultural people to accept services and pay fees which have no documented legal foundation , is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees .  
5 .  Government organizations whose duties include review and approval of matters in accordance with laws and regulations , and who impose on agricultural people a fee which is not clearly specified in laws or regulations and which has not been reviewed and approved by national and provincial level planning , pricing , or finance organizations , are committing an act which is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees .  
7 .  Collecting electricity fees which exceed electricity price standards , assessing agricultural people unjustified electricity fees , collecting rural network renovation fees which have not been approved by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , or collecting fees which exceed those formulated by organizations in charge of prices at provincial level , is classified as an illegal pricing action .  
Legally authorized fees reviewed and approved at the national and provincial level , and policies formulated by organizations in charge of prices at the central and provincial levels which involve agricultural prices and the collection of fees for services , must also be thoroughly put in order .  Start with a grasp of the actual situation , examine items category by category , reexamine and define .  
and go down to the basic level and enterprises more frequently to immerse ourselves among the vast numbers of masses in agricultural and pastoral areas , indicated Legqog . Through conducting thoroughgoing and practical investigations and studies , we will be able to have a definite object in view when guiding the region 's economic work , fulfill all our tasks in a more thoroughgoing and effective way , and ensure a complete success for our work in all fields .  
To readjust the structure of farming and stock breeding as well as the economic structure in agricultural and pastoral areas , we should readjust and optimize the structure of farming and stock breeding in line with the principle of " suiting measures to local conditions , giving greater prominence to key issues , integrating farming with stock breeding , and ensuring a well-coordinated development " ;  
We must start with an understanding of the actual situation in Xigaze , use as a foothold the abundant local resources , and work hard to develop the production of high-quality , highly effective , distinctive agricultural and livestock products .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
In the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " overall input into comprehensive agricultural development totaled 82.7-billion yuan of all types of funds ; the aggregate planned reformed mid-level production land was 173-million mu , the area of newly added and improved irrigation was 132-million mu , the area of newly added and improved reclaimed land was 60.33-million mu , and the area of increased field forest protection was 89.64-million mu , thus forcefully promoting the gradual heightening of China 's comprehensive agricultural production capabilities .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
We must adhere to taking irrigation as the focus of basic agricultural construction , continuing the reform of mid-level production fields , developing high yield , stable yield , water economizing , and highly effective agricultural fields , effectively consolidating , protecting , and raising the production capabilities of China 's basic agricultural fields . b ) .  
We must actively support the development of agricultural product processing industries , taking a path of integrated trade , industrial , and agricultural industrialization .  We must bolster qualified enterprises in their development of agricultural production , processing , and export bases , enhancing the motivating power on farmers by the market competition forces , and raising the level of agricultural production organization and the international competitive power of China 's agriculture .  
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation demanded that increasing export by every possible means should be regarded as a top priority in the development of China 's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the second half of this year , and that it is necessary to promote the export of mechanical and electrical products , textiles , and other traditional staple commodities and the export of new hi-tech products and agricultural products , and give impetus to export by major exporters and foreign-invested enterprises .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
On 9 May , the State Council held the second video and telephone conference on nationally coordinated operation to crack down on the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities and made arrangements for the nationwide joint operation against the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities , focusing on food , medicines , agricultural supplies , cotton , and illegally assembled automobiles using cannibalized parts .  
The main grain producing areas must seize the opportunity of the expanded grain market space following the opening up of the sales areas , to meet market demands , optimize the grain variety composition , improve the quality , develop industrialized operations , and achieve the goal of increasing agricultural economic returns and peasant incomes .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
To enable China 's agriculture to make positive reactions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by China 's participation in WTO and at the same time , support the great development of China 's west and protect agricultural resources and ecological environment , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] will quicken the pace of agricultural legislation , more intensively formulate laws and regulations to meet urgent needs , and to make timely reexamination and revision of the laws and regulations which are not suited to the development of the situation .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
Fifth , speaking of the country 's agricultural development , China has adopted a comprehensive policy of readjusting the internal industrial structure of agriculture , promoting an industrialized operation of agriculture , paying close attention to the building of the ecological environment , and speeding up the development of small cities and towns ; and has moved to resolve problems that are currently existing among its peasants and in its rural areas and agriculture .  
In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
To enable China 's agriculture to make positive reactions to the opportunities and challenges brought about by China 's participation in WTO and at the same time , support the great development of China 's west and protect agricultural resources and ecological environment , the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] will quicken the pace of agricultural legislation , more intensively formulate laws and regulations to meet urgent needs , and to make timely reexamination and revision of the laws and regulations which are not suited to the development of the situation .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;  
Introducing the practice of a comprehensive agricultural development which mainly aims at strengthening the building of basic agricultural facilities , protecting and improving the ecological environment , and developing a high-quality agriculture with a high yield and a high efficiency conforms to the requirements of the WTO 's " green box " policy ; and is also an important way for the government to support and protect agriculture at a time when China 's agriculture is heading for internationalization , he stressed .  
Thanks to the comprehensive agricultural development over the past more than 10 years , an average annual increase of 53.17 billion kg has been registered in the country 's grain production capacity , and the newly increased per capita net income of peasants in project areas stands 260 yuan higher at average than that of peasants in non-project areas .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
Xiang Huaicheng stressed : In comprehensive agricultural development , we must abide by the natural law and strengthen ecological environmental development to bring about sustainable economic and social development .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
Practice has fully proven that the central policies on grain reform are entirely correct and have played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for grain production , giving impetus to agricultural structural adjustment , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
China 's agricultural and rural economic development has now entered a new stage , in which farm products , particularly grain , have turned from a long-standing shortage to a basic balance of supply with demand and even a surplus in years of bumper harvests , and agricultural development has changed from being subject to resource restraints to being subject to the dual restraints of resources and markets .  
That is why we must take the initiative in conforming to the trend of the global economic integration , positively readjust China 's agricultural industrial structure , cut down the proportion of grain production , and more thoroughly participate in the international division of labor with regard to grain production and conduct more international grain transactions .  
In addition , regarding the 85 duty paragraphs of agricultural products which the US side is concerned about , the two sides agreed that the actual customs tariff of 30.8 percent at the signing of the agreement will be reduced to 14.5 percent in five years , the total amount of import quotas for wheat , rice , and corn set at 13 million tonnes in 2000 will be raised to 23 million tonnes in 2004 , and the business volume of non-state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be increased too .  
The results show that between 1993 and 1995 , the total annual average amount of the " green box policy " and input subsidies for China 's agriculture , which can be exempt from deductions , was 87.3 billion yuan , equivalent to only 9.4 percent of the agricultural added value , while the AMS [ previous acronym given in English ] for farm produce which needed to undertake the responsibility for deductions and which directly and indirectly affected trade , was negative for three years , with the annual average amount at minus 74.3 billion yuan .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that flood and drought have always been the serious hidden problems affecting China 's economic and social development and the people 's livelihood , and the impact of drought on agricultural production is particularly prominent .  All localities must firmly embrace the idea of fighting a major drought for a long time .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .  Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
As the longest river in China , Chang Jiang has 1.7 square kilometers of drainage areas , one fourth of the country 's cultivated areas , and one third of the country 's entire population ; and turns out two fifths of the country 's total industrial and agricultural output value .  The Chang Jiang valley plays a decisive role in China 's national economic and social development .  
As a result , although the labor productivity of agriculture in developing countries is the same as that of the industrial sector which is considerably lower than that in advanced countries , the domestic prices of primary agricultural products and their processed and manufactured goods are generally lower than the prices in the international markets , thus enjoying an absolute advantage .  
A wise way to adapt ourselves to the tide of globalization is to exchange concessions in land-intensive grain for a greater export of labor-intensive fresh agricultural products , and to exchange the opening-up of China 's monopolized industries for a greater share in the international market for China 's agriculture and its light industrial and textile industry - - Only this can be said a correct countermeasure .  
The outdated mode of agricultural production characterized by overflowing the field with water must be resolutely changed , the development of water-saving irrigation and dry farming should be taken as the basic work and fundamental measure for combating drought , and the transformation of farming system focusing on the economy on water should be carried out .  
Vice governors , vice chairmen , and vice mayors from pertinent provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in charge of agricultural and rural work , comrades in charge of pertinent departments including planning , agriculture , water conservancy , civil affairs , and finance , comrades in charge of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps , and comrades in charge of pertinent departments under the central authorities and the State Council attended the conference .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
The law on farm seeds adopted at this meeting is of great significance in protecting and using seed resources , standardizing the breeding , production , management , and use of seeds , protecting the legitimate rights and interests of seed breeders , producers , managers , and users , improving the quality of seeds , promoting an industrial management of farm seeds , expediting agricultural development through science and technology , and promoting the development of crop farming .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
The practice over the past several years fully shows that the policy on the reform of the grain circulation system , with the stress on " three policies and one reform , " has played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for growing grain crops , expediting agricultural restructuring , promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
The burdens on peasants are heavy , and the growth of their incomes has slowed down ; the problem of enlivening the rural market has yet to be effectively solved , and close attention should be paid to problems caused by natural agricultural disasters and a drop in grain production and in the prices of farm products .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
The bodies affiliated to the Tibet Science and Technology Association have translated and distributed 108 titles of popular science books which they have written for popularizing scientific knowledge and disseminating practical technology on topics such as scientific field cultivation , stockraising , and prevention and control of disease .  They have also shot Tibetan TV documentaries on advanced agricultural technology and sent them to the rural areas .  
Meanwhile , several large-scale enterprises in Taiwan are facing a financial crisis , natural disasters have occurred repeatedly in agricultural production , and farmers have difficulties in selling their products despite falling prices .  People have lost their interest in Taiwan 's stocks .  How can the stock market be saved by a " cardiac stimulant ? "  
To further intensify scientific and technological cooperation , the Chinese Government and the Japanese Government have decided to cooperatively develop a new round of 89 scientific and technological projects in the biological , nuclear energy , agricultural , medical , resources , and environmental protection fields .  
As China 's population has grown , the quality of people 's living standards has improved , economic and social development has quickened , and industrialization , urbanization , and agricultural modernization have speeded up , China 's water resources situation has become even worse , and contradictions between water supply and demand are becoming even more prominent .  So we must soberly realize the water problem .  
The main reason for prices to become stable in the first half of the year was due to some short-term factors , such as the hikes of international oil prices , the policy-related increases of house rentals and water and power rates , and dry climate in the north .  The prices of the great majority of industrial products and major agricultural products are still continuing to drop .  When such short-term factors disappear in the second half of the year , the possibility of a rally in prices as a whole will be slim .  
Agricultural departments at all levels and the vast numbers of agricultural scientific and technological personnel should go deep down to the forefront of production , help peasants fight droughts and ensure a successful spring sowing , see to a sound implementation of material and technological measures , pay close attention to the work of demonstration by example , guarantee the smooth progress of spring production , and lay a solid foundation for next year 's agricultural production .  
although grain output has fallen due to serious drought and adjustment of the sown area , output of various agricultural products such as oil-bearing crops , livestock , aquatic products , fruit , and vegetables has continued to increase ; there has been some rebound in the development speed and economic returns of the township and town enterprises ; the building of rural grassroots organizations , democracy and legal system , and spiritual civilization has been further stepped up ;  
Now a foundation has already been laid for our comprehensive national strength , and our country 's GDP in 2000 is expected to reach 8,600 billion yuan , with its total economic capacity ranking seventh in the world ; the output of major agricultural and industrial products have registered considerable growth , with the production of some of such products leaping to the fore front in the world .  
The key to achieving the continuous growth of peasants ' income lies in vigorously adjusting the agricultural structure , positively broadening the spheres for raising peasants ' income , and increasing the intensity of supporting and protecting agriculture to attain rural economic development on all sides . 
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the key to developing agricultural and rural economy and pushing forward agricultural modernization lies in the implementation of the strategy to invigorate agriculture on the strength of science and culture and place the training of qualified personnel in a prominent position .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , under the guidance of the party 's agricultural and rural policies , tremendous changes have taken place in the appearance of China 's rural areas , the rural economy has developed in a comprehensive way , peasants ' income has been notably increased , and stability has been maintained in rural society .  
The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
As China 's only agricultural high-technology industrial demonstration zone , Yangling should study and apply well the important ideology on " three represents , " really regard the development requirements for advanced productive forces , the orientation of advancement of advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest number of people as the criteria for teaching , scientific research , technological development and all fields of work , and build the Yangling demonstration zone into a first-grade agricultural base for agricultural scientific research and technological development at home and abroad . .  
It is necessary to turn this agricultural demonstration zone into a national arid and semi-arid farming technological research and development center , an agricultural technician training center in the western region , a scientific and technological achievements conversion and industrial center , a center for breeding good strains , and an agricultural science and technological information spreading center .  
In addition to the joint announcement that has important meaning for developing the relationship between China and Laos , the relative departments of the two countries signed an agreement on economic technology , a summary of the first meeting of the economic trade skill cooperation committees , exchange notes for China agreeing to undertake Luang Prabang hospital items , an agreement to develop leopoldite resources in the Vientiane area , and an memorandum of understanding for agricultural cooperation .  There are altogether six bilateral cooperative documents .  
The agreement on China 's accession to the WTO signed between China and the United States has broken the monopoly of China 's state-owned foreign trade enterprises over the import and export of agricultural products , and special stipulations have been made regarding the shares of imported agricultural products between the state-owned foreign trade enterprises and private enterprises .  It means that private enterprises must be granted more rights on foreign trade operations .  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Investment should be focused on the following areas next year : conducting well the ongoing projects funded by national debts ; accelerating the construction and transformation of agricultural and forestry water control projects , transport and communications , urban infrastructure , environmental protection , and urban and rural power grids and the construction of grain reserve depots directly under the central authorities and affordable and practical housing ; supporting the technological transformation of enterprises and the industrialization of high technology ;  
In the aspect of agriculture and rural areas , the regional party committee and government have actively readjusted the production structure of agriculture and on the basis of conducting in-depth investigation and study formulated the opinions of the autonomous region about readjusting and optimizing the industrial structure of agricultural products and pushing forward the industrialized operation of agriculture and proposed that farm production should focus on improving quality and uphold the unification of output , quality , structure , and effectiveness .  
We must take further steps to integrate ideology with the Central Committee 's plans and requirements , increase understanding , strengthen confidence , take hold of opportunities , take prompt action , and conscientiously launch this round of study and educational activities in order to provide strong ideological and organizational assurances for progress in agricultural , rural , and peasant work .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
Speaking about consolidating and standardizing the order of the market economy , Wu Yi emphasized : First , it is necessary to give prominence to key points , accurately pinpoint and firmly grasp conspicuous problems that seriously disturb the market order , damage industrial and agricultural production , and are harmful to the legitimate rights and interests of the producers and consumers , concentrate efforts on solving special problems , and strive to obtain visible results .  
Reform the permanent residence registration system to allow people who invest or operate businesses in the west or take part in the development of the west to keep their original residence registration .  Any individual who has a legal permanent residence in a city below the prefectural level or in a small town and has a steady job or a steady source of income may , if he wishes , apply for permanent residence registration in the township .  Encourage the proper movement of the redundant agricultural work force and proper inter-regional population circulation .  
China is a vast country with a population of over 1.2 billion people , and broadcasting has close ties with the thinking , work and life of the masses .  The role of broadcasting can not be overlooked or replaced in the urban and rural areas , especially in the remote agricultural and pastoral areas .  Broadcasting has a great promise and a great future .  
The national agricultural work conference recently concluded in Beijing pointed out that this year , efforts will be focused on doing a good job in increasing peasants ' income and enhancing grain security , thus laying a solid foundation for economic development and social stability in the whole country .  
The rural market information system will be established and perfected .  The agricultural quality standards and monitoring system will be set up at a quicker pace .  The work of formulating and revising trade standards and local standards for agriculture will be further advanced .  
Hubei has outstanding natural conditions and rich resources .  It is nationally renowned for its scientific and educational undertakings .  With its solid industrial and agricultural foundation , it has the potential for rapid development .  
Hubei will concentrate on the development of six major industries , including high-tech industries in " Wuhan - - China 's Optical Valley , " with electronic information industry at the core , modern manufacturing industries with automotive industry at the core , raw materials industries with iron and steel industry at the core , energy industries with hydropower generation at the core , modern agricultural industries with the production of green food at the core , and tertiary industries with tourism at the core .  
In recent years , the institute has engaged in nearly 50 research projects , including those under the state 's 863 Program , projects supported financially by the state 's natural science research fund , and international cooperative research projects .  So far , it has won 11 national and provincial awards for its achievements and has become China 's major backbone research force in the field of agricultural biotechnology .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
A relatively perfect system of agricultural science and education and a system of technology dissemination have been initially instituted , the contingent of scientific and technological personnel has been steadily expanded , the basic research in the agricultural sphere and research on new high technologies have made rapid advances , and some research items have held a leading position in the world .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Li Lanqing pointed out that since the first national meeting of agricultural science and technology held in 1963 , through the unremitting efforts of the agricultural scientific and technological workers and various sectors , we have basically resolved the technological problems in terms of agricultural quantitative growth at present .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
After that , we will take another 10 to 15 years to institute a new-type agricultural scientific and technological innovative system that is suited to China 's agricultural big power status and comes up to the international advanced standards , so that China 's agricultural science and technology will be able to rise to the advanced level in the world .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
fully release the initiative and creativity of the scientific and technological personnel , peasants , and enterprises in disseminating agricultural science and technology , adopt the forms of combining the rank of professionals with peasant organizations , combining the leading role of the government and the guiding role of the markets , and combining paid services with gratuitous services , and break a new path of scientific and technological dissemination that tallies with China 's national conditions .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
Agricultural development has changed from the resource constraint of the past to the dual constraint of resources and market ; problems such as irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low comprehensive returns on agriculture , and the slowdown in the growth of peasant incomes are becoming more conspicuous by the day , and these set new and still higher demands on the development of agricultural science and technology .  
If we are unable to achieve breakthroughs in the progress of agricultural science and technology , it will be hard to enhance the comprehensive productive forces in agriculture and agricultural competitiveness , and it will then be hard to meet the demands of all-round building of a comfortably well-off living standard .  
Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , pointed out at the close of the meeting : The Agricultural Technology Development Outline formulated by China at the beginning of the century manifests the requirements of promoting a new agricultural technological revolution put forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and is a comprehensive and systematic guideline document guiding China 's agricultural technological development in the future .  
We must regard nurturing of talents as a crucial measure and build an agricultural technology contingent formed by technological leaders , agricultural technology promotion experts , agricultural technology entrepreneurs , high-caliber peasants , and agricultural technology management cadres , thereby promoting independent , healthy , and sustained development of China 's agricultural technology undertakings .  
Under the current situation in which the standard of China 's rural productive forces is fairly low , it is difficult to carry out agricultural scientific research and development without government support .  
If there is a long-term drop off in grain prices , the readjustment of the agricultural structure will be delayed , the shift of the surplus rural workforce will be impeded , and it will be impossible to boost the income of the farmers , which may result in a setback to the enthusiasm of the farmers and shake the agricultural foundation , thus jeopardizing the entire national economy .  
The party committees at all levels should fully understand the momentous and far-reaching significance of the current " study and education " activities , further integrate their thinking with the major policy decisions of the central authorities , use the idea of " three represents " to lead and assume overall responsibility for the agricultural and rural work , strengthen leadership , organize the work carefully , seek actual results , and have a good and firm grasp of the " study and education " activities conscientiously .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
Li Chunting stressed in his report : During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Shandong will continue to center its efforts around the work of increasing the income of peasants ; strive to fulfill the target of accelerating the process of agricultural modernization ; and ensure a steady growth for its agriculture , a sustained increase in the income of its peasants , and a lengthy and peaceful reign in society .  
The province will stabilize its total acreage of basic farmland at 5.33 million hectares , and its total grain output , at 40 million tonnes .  By taking the market as the guide and by focusing on the need for optimizing products , the province will develop well-marketable products of a fine quality , products for special purposes , as well as new varieties of brand-name products , products with unique features , and less-common products ; meanwhile , it will also speed up the development of a new-type agriculture , environmental-friendly foodstuffs , and organic agricultural products .  
- - Comprehensively implementing the strategy of industrializing the agricultural operation , improving the processing and transformation level of agricultural products , and enhancing the extension effect of agriculture .  The province will actively spread new operational forms in its rural areas , such as linking industrial companies with farming households and introducing an orders-based agriculture ;  
Yuan Longping courageously broke into the forbidden zone of breeding self-pollinating crops , an area considered worldwide as impenetrable .  He presented a fresh view on taking advantage of paddy rice heterosis , achieved a historic breakthrough in paddy rice breeding , and made an outstanding contribution to China 's grain production and the development of agricultural science .  
Responsible persons of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities , and the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps ; responsible persons of concerned ministries and departments of the party Central Committee , the National People 's Congress and the State Council ; and responsible persons of offices of leading groups of financial and agricultural departments and commissions of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas attended the meeting .  
Several decades of effort have brought dramatic changes to the Chinese countryside , and combined agricultural production capacity has taken several steps at a time consecutively .  After several thousand years , China 's troubling problem of feeding its people has finally been resolved and farmers ' lives overall have attained a level of relative comfort .  
According to Anhui province 's statistics , since the fee-to-tax reform was implemented , the agricultural two taxes and their attachments collected by the province were reduced 23.6 percent from what was collected in agricultural tax , agricultural unique product tax , township joint planning and village withdrawals before the reform was implemented .  Implementing this reform , combined with abolition of the butchery tax and rural educational fundraising raising , meant the total tax and fee burden for farmers dropped by 31 percent .  
It relieved farmers of complicated and varied tax and fee payments , and clarified bookkeeping .  In short , it implemented " one tax , one process . "  So farmers are now so enthusiastic about paying their due taxes legally that the entire county accomplished its agricultural tax collection work in just a little over 20 days , something unimaginable in the past .  
In particular , we must regard increasing the peasants ' income as the focus of agricultural and rural work , as the main task to tackle in developing the rural economy , and as an important yardstick to measure the results of the " three represents " [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] study and education activities in rural areas .  
He said that in order to achieve agricultural modernization , it is necessary to increase the technological content of agriculture , make positive efforts to readjust the structure of farm production with the optimization of species , the improvement of quality and the achievement of better performance as the central tasks , energetically foster leading enterprises , and boost the successive performance of agriculture and increase peasants ' income through the promotion of " integration of companies and peasant households , " " farming on order " and other forms .  
At the same time , the proposal of these policy principles is very practicable .  For example , with respect to protecting and improving grain production capability , the ' outline ' stipulates strict execution of the basic agricultural land protection system , maintaining a dynamic equilibrium in the total amount of land under cultivation in the nation , and ensuring that by 2005 the total area of land under cultivation will not be less than 128 million hectares .  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
Lu Ming spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association : From the high plane of the modernization program , we should reexamine the importance of the question of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants at the current stage , draft agricultural policies , and coordinate other policies in light of the requirements of laying stress on , supporting , and developing agriculture .  
Their wide-ranging discussions covered such issues as industrial development , agricultural structural adjustment , increase of peasants ' income , the scientific , cultural , and educational undertakings , the building of democracy and legal system , and so on . 
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
Fifth , we should more effectively promote and spread major practicable farming techniques , enhance the quality of farm produce and the comprehensive agricultural efficiency , thus providing technological support for restructuring . 
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
Wu Jinglian , famous economist and standing committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , today at a news conference remarked that the large-scale lay-offs of workers that have occurred in China in recent years are inevitable reflections of the employment system and policies of a planned economy that is undergoing the process of economic transition .  The large influx of excess agricultural labor in non-agricultural industries has also made employment increasingly difficult .  Thus , improving the social environment for employment is a new solution for re-employment .  
Speaking on environmental protection during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Qu Geping said : Of all five-year plans , the draft outlines of the 10th Five-Year Plan place the greatest emphasis on environmental protection .  In addition to setting aside one special chapter - - " The Ecological Environment and Environmental Protection " - - to detail the protection plan , it also sets requirements for projects to be accomplished by the industrial , agricultural , and other sectors , thus incorporating the strategy for achieving sustainable developments with the national economic development plan .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
If we have steady agricultural development , peasants will live in happiness and rural areas will be prosperous .  If such being the case , the state will enjoy a stable situation and the world will be peaceful .  China 's history has proven this over the past several thousand years .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
With the development of industry and the tertiary industry , the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture is constantly increasing , and more and more people of the agricultural population will break away from traditional agriculture and move to industrial and urban areas .  
He added : To achieve the " two higher " objective " and effect restructuring in the five aspects , Henan will give prominence to following eight measures in the course of comprehensively advancing economic and social development : First , build two agricultural bases , turn Henan into the country 's major high-quality wheat production and processing base , and major animal product production and processing base .  
As stressed at the session , strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the economy and increasing the farmers ' income must be considered as economic tasks of prime importance .  It is imperative to speed up agricultural and rural economic restructuring , energetically promote the industrialized operation of agriculture , vigorously conduct rural reforms in all fields , truly reduce the burdens on farmers , continue the help-the-poor work in rural areas , and take positive and steady steps to proceed with the urbanization program .  
He pointed out : Taking agricultural restructuring and the increase of farmers ' income as the basic target and major task of the current agricultural and rural economic work is a correct policy decision made by the central authorities after having made a thorough analysis of the situation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new period .  Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy is not only an important way to increase farmers ' income but also a strategic measure to comprehensively improve the overall quality and efficiency of agriculture and carry out agricultural modernization .  
( c ) whether the level of fee payable in respect of such private land is on a par with the level of rent payable for the industrial land leased under short term tenancy ; if so , the basis of determination by the Administration and whether the income receivable for agricultural use of the land should form a deducting factor in the fee calculating formula ?  
According to the information provided , the Xinfengjiang Reservoir plays vital and multiple roles in regulating the flow of Dongjiang , improving the environment , assuring the quality of life and supplying water for industrial and agricultural use on its lower reaches , protecting navigation , etc .  
By observing the sky , people were able to forecast seasonal changes accurately and to devise calendar to plan the agricultural activities such as sowing and reaping .  Moreover , the ancient emperors called themselves " the Son of Heaven " .  They believed that they were sent to the Earth at God 's will and thought that changes in celestial phenomena were closely linked with the fate of their reigns .  Therefore , the officials responsible for astronomical affairs had extremely high status in the society .  
Since ancient times , the Chinese population could broadly be divided into agricultural and nomadic sectors due to geographic and climatic diversities within the Chinese territories .  The agricultural land and pastoral areas were established south and north of the Great Wall respectively .  
China 's earliest royal dynasty - the Xia dynasty ( 2070-1600BC ) - first established its capital in the Henan region and during the subsequent 3,300 years more than 20 dynasties established their capitals in Henan Province . The large quantity of archaeological finds demonstrate that as early as 400,000 or 500,000 years ago humans were living in the Central Plains area and at some time between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago agricultural production had made its beginnings there during the period of Peiligang culture ( c . 7000X5000BC ) .  
The Government will resume 29 private agricultural lots with a total area of about 10,130 square metres to facilitate the construction of a primary school and a secondary school in Sheung Shui . The proposed projects aim to meet the increasing demand for primary and secondary school places in the North District .  
The participants were divided into eight panel groups to discuss specific topics in their specialized field , education and culture , business and industry , financial and monetary affairs communications reconstruction , agricultural reconstruction , social welfare , public health and urban development .  
Unfortunately more extensive development of this area has been suspended due to the corrosive properties of the hot water . The steam alone , however , is far less acid , and a feasibility study to use dry steam for agricultural and industrial purposes has been going on since 1974 . The main achievements of the project include a lumber drying kiln , a horticulture greenhouse , and a general laboratory for testing soil sterilization , cereal drying and shrimp and poultry culture .  
During the switch in the social infrastructure from an agricultural to an industrial base , embroidery has proved to be a valuable stabilizing force in cultivating the mind and preserving the cultural heritage , while at the same time earning foreign exchange for the country .  
Traditional rustic architecture dominated by red walls , goats dotted here and there in the meadows , an old lady with her hair in a bun feeding chickens , and serene village roads , are all indicative of an ancient and prosperous Chinese agricultural society .  
Topics covered included improving the aborigines ' living standards , dredging waterways in Er Chung to prevent floods , strengthening communications with people at the basic level , and stabilizing prices of agricultural products .  
Some plants from remote mountain areas can cost as much as NT $ 3-4,000 ( US $ 75-100 ) a kilo , while those gathered from riverbanks and agricultural land cost as little as NT $ 30 or 40 . Most herbs from distant areas are dried , while those grown locally are sold fresh and must be consumed within three or four days .  
These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
Educational opportunities are extremely limited , with room in colleges for only 3% of the youth . Strict social controls make it difficult for peasants to escape their traditional agricultural roles ; such opportunities are rarer now than they were before 1949 . Indeed , the mainland China of today has become quite conservative : those in positions of authority are mostly from poor agricultural backgrounds with little formal education .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .  
In its growth from a poor agricultural village to a modern industrial city , from a labor to a capital intensive industrial economic base , Kaohsiung is a mirror of Taiwan 's overall economic development . Kaohsiung has paid a price for its industrial boom .  
The majority of the first settlers were engaged in farming . The rugged terrain , and damp climate encouraged the cultivation of tea and oranges . The past 30 years have seen Taiwan evolve from an agricultural based economy to that of an industrial-based nation . Industrial development in the Taipei basin spurred the growth of many satellite communities such as Yung Ho , Chung Ho and Pan Ch'iao .  
But a strong base of agricultural success has already been firmly established . New produce such as the avocado , the new fish hatcheries and domesticated animal farms in Peishihli , and the recently planned re-cultivation of Hsiaopili have successfully taken over what began with pomelo cultivation .  
New construction of buildings and roads is a continual danger to the city 's treasured historical architecture . Tainan County is wide and level , with an area of approximately 68 miles . With the sea on one side and fertile plains on the other , Tainan has long been favored as both a fishing and agricultural center . Its fishery fleet brings in more than 30,000 tons of fish per year .  
Q : Now that the R . O . C has severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , it is rumored that Uruguay may establish ties with the Mainland . In the face of international political realities , it is very difficult for the R . O . C to appeal to " morality " and limited agricultural and economic aid as a basis for diplomacy . How should we deal with this situation ?  
Twenty and thirty years ago , the production of rice made up more than 75 percent of the total agricultural produce of Taiwan . In those days the word ' agriculture ' was just about synonymous with ' rice , ' " says Wang Yu-chao , director of the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan . " The ' agriculture ' that we speak of today has since been broadened in scope to include the diverse areas of farming , forestry , fishing , and animal husbandry . "  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
As mayor of Taipei and then as governor of Taiwan , whether faced with hectoring legislators or a recalcitrant citizenry , he always managed to turn dissension into harmony and get " good marks . " Many people may not know that he first earned the favorable notice of the reform-minded Mr . Chiang for a bold and substantive critical report that he made on agricultural policy as a consultant with the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction .  
Currently R . O . C . agriculture has major weaknesses . First , natural agricultural production can not compete with mechanized industrial production , leading to an outmigration of labor , which affects the ability of agriculture to continue to develop ; Second , small farm operations lack economy of scale , leading to a low return on resources , which in turn influences the raising of real incomes of farmers .  
The conference summarized its discussions in 11 conclusions , aimed at an ideal agricultural system including : a structure for agricultural policy with comprehensive powers , strong and capable farmers ' organizations , autonomous price regulation , stable agriculture profits , moderate trade protection , reasonable prices for inputs , continuous use of agriculture resources , a low-pollution environment , stable growth in agriculture , hygienic and safe agricultural products , and safe and healthy rural villages .  
Currently the agricultural sector faces three major problems . ( 1 ) The problem of the continued existence of small-scale , low-income agricultural households ; ( 2 ) The problem of low prices and income for commercialized agriculture under competition from abroad ; and ( 3 ) The problem of future development and policy direction in an economically dynamic society .  
Specialists commonly agree that the solution lies in combining small farms into large ones to achieve economies of scale and in promotion of planned production and sales , to economically utilize agricultural resources . Moreover , modernized construction should be strengthened in the rural areas to build villages with the potential to meet the needs of the time . This will solve problems of the farming population and the farming villages simultaneously . (  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
The agricultural mission not only helps Malawi develop agriculture but also serves our foreign service community there by providing them with fresh produce and playing the role of general jacks-of-all-trades and Mr . Fix-it 's . If the car breaks down , if it has a flat tire , if the screen door 's stuck , if you need some styrofoam or nylon cord for packing , if you 're short a blanket and pillow for a guest . . . just track down a team member and you 're sure to come away satisfied .  
With the arrival of the 20th century , as Australia 's abundant agricultural , industrial and mineral resources were increasingly exploited , more and more investment was devoted to applied research in related areas , Before 1960 , when Melbourne was still the only university in the state of Victoria , faculties and departments with a practical orientation flourished in particular .  
In future things will be clearer , with free competition in agricultural production whereby prices will be fixed by supply and demand . Those unable to compete will be eliminated , while those who can will find a welcome market for their produce . In this way farmers ' labor , resources and investment will be directed towards higher added value products . Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Of course this is related to our fitting in with Malaysian national policy - - to develop the east coast and to develop agriculture , " says Lin , explaining their " good luck . " Although Malaysia is an agricultural country , it only has palm oil and rubber as relatively well developed cash crops . They rely on imports for most other agricultural products like fruit , rice , and vegetables . Production of aquatic products is also low , so that agriculture has always been one of the sectors with investment incentives .  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
Unwilling to bring production : In primitive times Puli was a vast lake ; later the water disappeared , leaving a basin filled with extremely rich lake-bottom soil . This made Puli into a main agricultural center in Central Taiwan , with the major claims to fame being red sugar cane and bamboo shoots .  
Currently , in the coastal areas all around the island , smugglers are mostly bringing in agricultural products with a relatively high value , like peanuts , garlic , mushrooms , dried lilies , red beans , betel nuts , sticky rice , Chinese medicines and fish products . Beef , pork , lamb and intestines are also smuggled in , as well as rare animals like Tibetan Mastiffs .  
Water comes from heaven . " In agricultural societies , things which are filtered out with water are all organic matter that can be broken down and returned to the natural cycle . Thus , in several places in north Taiwan which are relatively short of water , the agricultural irrigation system and the town or village drainage system were linked together , so that water could be circulated and reused , thus saving water resources .  
" One shovelful could fill a tin can . " Today vast stretches of land have been developed , and pesticides have been badly overused in cultivated areas . Earthworms are highly vulnerable to sudden acute poisoning , " so that in many hectares of farmland , you could n't find a single worm , " says Huang , who worked hard with Kuo looking for the creatures in agricultural areas in Hsinchu .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Because the ozone layer can absorb ultraviolet light from sunlight and block out most of the radiation harmful to life on earth , as the protective function of this layer is weakened , the incidence of diseases related to unltraviolet rays , such as skin cancer or cataracts , rises dramatically ; the immune systems of animals become repressed ; plant growth stagnates ; and it even leads to a drop in agricultural production and mass deaths in aquatic life .  
Today , agricultural villages are in a period of transition . The elderly are not accustomed to living with their children in the crowded cities , and they 're unwilling to live in old folk 's homes . If old trees and the environments around them can be preserved , the villages can remain semi-agricultural , the elderly will have places to go , and their spiritual needs will be taken care of , too .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
Kang Mu-hsiang , who applies sculptural concepts in his carving , attracts customers to his studio with a large picture of himself holding a chisel and a gouge . Tseng Chin-tsai 's sign uses the theme of a swineherd in the old agricultural society and the song " When Will You Return ? " to allude to the inevitability of suffering in human life . Here one can also find pottery studios , a studio producing mainly carvings of horses , and so on . All the color of Sanyi is concentrated in this one short street .  
Lots of people listen to the weather report every day , but you probably did n't know that the Central Weather Bureau operates an astronomical observatory which is not devoted to predicting the weather . It is responsible for calculating the precise timing of the 24 Solar Terms of the Chinese calendar every year . And after examining the data , the Ministry of the Interior includes it in the annual farmer 's almanac , distributed every year to each agricultural worker .  
In the US , for example , residential and agricultural areas are clearly separate , and huge areas of agricultural land are often devoted to a single crop , so it is easy to differentiate the objects in the satellite image .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
A food supply is the most basic of human needs , and farm produce is the last bastion of protectionism in the ROC ; it is also the segment most prone to sensitive price fluctuations . This situation is not unique to Taiwan , but is common throughout the world . Fortunately , except for agricultural produce , most household items , domestic appliances , cosmetics and so on were thrown open to free competition earlier , and so have already entered an era of more stable prices in line with those in advanced countries worldwide .  
As in the cultural , agricultural , and economic fields , cross-strait narcotics exchanges and mutual reliance among dealers have also grown significantly these past several years . Cross-strait anti-drug cooperation should be implemented with urgency , but it is stagnating amidst disputes over sovereignty and legal jurisdiction , and it has proven difficult to make any breakthroughs .  
Archaeologist Chang Kuang-chih argues that Tapenkeng Culture may have been an old culture spread widely in southeast coastal China . It may have been one of the two agricultural cultures that developed in parallel in China at that time , the other being the familiar Yangshao Culture which is mainly distributed around the midstream portions of the Yellow River .  
When rain falls from the heavens groundwater is naturally replenished , and for thousands of years Chinese farmers have sung : " We work from sunrise / We rest at sunset / We dig wells for water / What do we care about the might of emperors ? " The ceaseless supply of groundwater bubbling up from wells enabled people to drink when they were thirsty and wash when they were dusty , and allowed agricultural society to ignore the power of emperors and self-confidently affirm that people 's value came from living on the land .  
Tea by that time had already become an international commodity . The price went through constant fluctuations , so during those years some people made money , and some people lost money . In this way , the stable system of agricultural production and commerce in previous times , as well as the systems of wholesale distribution and management , were all destroyed .  
Opposite the main entrance , the spacious farmhouse boasts a wallful of award certificates and wooden plaques from friends : 1985 Taoyuan County Top Ten Farmers ; First Place , 1994 Organic Growers ' Exhibition ; 1995 Farm Entrepreneur of the Year . Just this year , Chuang was honored with Taiwan 's highest agricultural award , the " Shen Nong " award for his " leadership role in research and promotion of organic farming methods and production of safe , high-quality vegetables . "  
According to Hsieh Shun-ching 's analysis , increasing grain production is of chief importance in the African and Southern Pacific regions ; raising the overall level of " agricultural-entrepreneurial development " in the agricultural industry is most important in Southeast Asia ; for the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean , the most numerous group , the key to development is crops that possess either high economic value or export potential .  
Having studied at an agricultural high school , Li thought she was fully prepared to farm . But facing it firsthand , she quickly discovered that farm work was n't as easy or as laid back as she had imagined . And after becoming more closely involved with Chiungchiao Keng 's people , she gradually came to understand the town 's problems as well .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
The move toward open agricultural markets was agreed upon by the WTO member nations in the Uruguay round of GATT . With this international consensus and the global trend toward free trade in agriculture , Taiwan is finding it difficult to swim against the current by maintaining its protectionist agricultural policies .  
" Not only do we need to make the environment more suitable , we also need to change our habits and thinking about leisure , " says Lin Wan-yi . Lin says that with regard to Taiwan 's leisure-time habits , you have to remember that the whole society only went from being an agricultural one to an industrial one 20 or 30 years ago . " The traditional Chinese agrarian society did n't operate on a system of weeks . People 's holidays were folk festivals and their way of celebrating them was active and noisy . "  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
On another front , because Taiwan is poised to enter the World Trade Organization , Taiwan agriculture must face competition from imported agricultural products . Cheng Shu-hsing , an assistant in the AIS horticulture lab and a specialist in wild vegetables , explains : " We are encouraging localities to develop specialized agricultural products in small volumes but greatly diversified varieties . Although production volume is low , by diversifying and growing unusual crops , farmers will better their chances of surviving WTO admission and soften its overall impact on agriculture here . "  
Because of agricultural crops ' short harvesting cycles , there is as yet little alternative to controlling pest outbreaks by the moderate use of pesticides , unless production methods can be changed ; but when transient insect infestations occur in gardens or in woodland-except where " wood borers " such as ghost moths ( family Hepialidae ) or goat moths ( family Cosiidae ) , which are potentially fatal to trees , are involved-forestry experts generally advise against attempting wholesale eradication with pesticides .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
In recent times , due to the limited productive value of its mainly agricultural economy , the township had become rather run-down and had been losing population to other areas . Nonetheless , it still had many distinctive historic features such as Chichi Railway Station and Minghsin Academy , along with traditional rural scenes such as tobacco fields , banana groves , fruit orchards and tree-lined roads . These assets had long ago given Lin the idea of using them as tourist resources to breathe new life into Chichi .  
Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production . As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year . Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor . Few bothered to worry about their external appearance . Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end . Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
After that fiasco , " investment " became a nasty word for many locals , who recoiled from betting on the economy at the very time when the economy entered an industrial boom that would last for decades . As the rest of Taiwan raced ahead , Chishan remained preserved in its rose-tinted memories of banana money . An agricultural adventurer After Ku 's father passed away his dwindling estate was split up between Ku and his siblings , thus splitting the Ku fortune into still smaller shares .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
President Chen has also instructed Taiwan 's financial and economic community that regardless of whether the US fights a quick or a protracted war , Taiwan must respond with flexibility by stabilizing the equity and currency markets and guaranteeing the supply of crude oil , agricultural raw materials , and staple commodities .  
But Liu 's father by no means encouraged Arthur to go into this field , and so he studied agricultural chemistry at National Taiwan University . But it proved impossible to resist his natural inclinations , and he ended up in the broadcast world anyway . Liu attended National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated High School , which had a relatively lively , open atmosphere .  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
Apart from a more diverse choice of agricultural produce , customs duties on imported motor vehicles will be cut by 30% , and many large supermarket chains have already signed agreements with mainland Chinese manufacturers to import large quantities of products such as electrical appliances at bargain prices . In a time of economic recession , consumers will be able to enjoy the same standard of consumption while spending less .  
COA chairman Chen Hsi-huang , who earned his degree in agricultural economics at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) notes that Taiwan 's agricultural policies used to stress increased production-producing as much as possible on the limited land available . Consequently , Taiwan-produced canned champignon mushrooms and asparagus commanded 65% of the international market . Coupled with the export of massive amounts of sugar , rice , and bananas , this stimulated the formation of capitalistic agriculture which , in turn , helped prepare the way for the subsequent take off of industry .  
Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers . " Technological developments in Taiwan 's agriculture have never ceased to move forward , " says Lee . With its myriad technological breakthroughs , agricultural testing institutions , experimental farms , fishery testing institutions , and private enterprises , Taiwan is one of the best in the research and development of new agricultural strains .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
As for Samson Tsou , with his incomparably rich academic and professional background and experience of international agricultural practice , he intends to move into teaching and research , and hopes also to be able to make a contribution to the development of international businesses in the field of vegetable farming , and thus achieve an ideal that is also in AVDRC 's future agenda .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
In addition , to cope with competition from low-priced imported rice resulting from Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization , beginning in 2002 Wufeng began cooperating with an agricultural research station of the Council of Agriculture ( COA ) to promote the use of Tainong 71 " Yi-chuan fragrant rice . " This variety , developed by Dr . Kuo Yi-chuan , has round and robust grains , and when cooked gives off a special taro fragrance .  
A new policy of " industrial Taiwan , agricultural Southeast Asia " was crafted , and Japan began to actively promote industrial development in Taiwan with an eye to making the island self-sufficient in the event of war in the Pacific . The Japanese contribution to development can be seen in three areas . In terms of basic industry , the " new city " of Kaohsiung , which the colonial authorities began building in 1904 , became the main base for moving farther into Southeast Asia .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
With a strong foundation in agricultural research and development laid during the Japanese era , Taiwanese agriculturalists have been hard at work improving their rice stocks , employing a variety of techniques ranging from mass selection of seeds and the introduction of new varieties , to hybridization and mutation breeding .  
The dominant influence of NTU-known as Taida to Taiwanese-in political circles can be seen in the fact that the " Taida Gang " accounts for more than 40 legislators , including members of both the governing and opposition parties . And the glory of Taida has not been limited to politics . As Taiwan has made the transition from agricultural to industrial to high-tech society , many NTU alums have from scratch developed chip processing , IC design , and the largest notebook computer factory in the world , similarly producing a brilliant record .  
Over time , with the constant expansion and division of academic disciplines , new units were established , including divisions of medicine , engineering , and agricultural science , as well as graduate institutes of tropical medicine , southern civilization , and southern resources . By the time Japanese rule ended in 1945 , the university had five academic divisions , a preparatory school , three graduate institutes , and 115 academic chairs , with 378 full-time academic personnel , 123 part-time personnel and 382 students .  
When NTU absorbed the Agricultural Division of TIU , it changed its name to the College of Agriculture ( CoA ) . With seven academic departments it was NTU 's largest college . Later , the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was split into two , and the mechanical engineering group in the agricultural engineering department became a separate department . The CoA gradually expanded to 12 departments .  
Professor Tsai Hung-chin , recently retired from Taiwan National University 's Agricultural Extension Department , goes further . He points out that Taiwan agricultural products have for some time tended to earn low profits and that farm income has had no guarantees . Even if high-quality products are raised , in light of the multiple layers of exploitation existing throughout the sales system and the dumping of low-priced products on the market , farmers are frequently unable to earn a profit .  
As for the current situation , there is perhaps no immediate solution to the two major problems of " small-scale " farming that is unable to recover investment capital and the aging of the manpower in the agricultural sector . But as for improving production and marketing , this is something the government can apply its efforts toward .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day . However , as their numbers have increased , the limited availability of agricultural land and the impact of modernization and natural disasters have meant that they now lack adequate resources to meet their daily subsistence needs , and have been reduced to penury and perpetual shortage .  
Over a decade ago , a program was developed here that balances conservation and agricultural use through a " shelterbelt / base / facilities " approach . Can this approach , along with the increasingly successful development of ecotourism , help create a new future for the controversial highland farming industry ?  
They attributed the crisis , one of the most severe agricultural disasters in southern Africa over the past 10 years , to " the area 's weakened farm production and supply after two years of production decline caused by bad weather coupled with economic crisis and the suspension of agricultural activities in some areas . "  
They indicated : " Natural disasters have resulted in poor harvests for 2 consecutive years .  In addition , economic crisis and disruption of farming activities in some areas have reduced production and supply of foods to the region - creating one of the worst agricultural catastrophes in southern Africa in 10 years . "  
They noted : " Two successive years of poor harvests brought about by natural calamities , coupled with economic crises and the disrupted farming in some areas , have reduced the food production and supply in this region , resulting in one of the gravest agricultural disasters in a decade in southern Africa . "  
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) on nuclear weapons , and all its atomic programs are based on " peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical , agricultural and energy generation purposes " and " within the framework of the internationally recognized absolute rights of any country "  
Reforms have concentrated on promoting sound macroeconomic policies , price liberalization , an increased role for the private sector coupled with a more focused role for the public sector , as well as measures to increase agricultural production .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
Growing environmental awareness worldwide has stimulated the development of a complex range of regulations and institutional mechanisms aimed at controlling the adverse environmental effects of industrial and agricultural production .  
Cognizant of urban transition as an irreversible demographic , economic and societal process which can be a major instrument for securing balanced economic and spatial development and relieve the severe pressure on scarce agricultural land ,  
The foregoing review has demonstrated the vital importance of groundwater whether confined or not , as a source of fresh water for both human consumption and for industrial and agricultural use .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
Initially , this system covered all employees in the nonagricultural activities of the private and social sectors and the employed in the socially owned agricultural sector , whereas later on it expanded to include active individual farmers as well .  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
One form of non-governmental organization follow-up to the Rio de Janeiro Conference has thus been a continuing constructive critique of SARD concepts , emphasizing such elements as democracy , participation , equitable access to resources , local solutions , cultural values , social justice and equity , and ecological agricultural systems often adapted from traditional methods .  
It seeks to foster development of sustainable agricultural production systems and to ensure that the following elements of sustainability are incorporated in the formulation and implementation of Bank-financed projects : increased and stabilized productivity ; rational use of natural resources ; enhancement of the quality of life and the environment ; and intergenerational equity .  
The environmental problems have been aggravated by agricultural policies - which have encouraged increasing production of some commodities on fragile lands and the use of inappropriate farm practices - and the lack of markets to value environmental public goods or the failures of some markets to internalize environmental costs and benefits within farmers ' decision-making .  
In all countries , policies oriented towards promoting food and agricultural production and rural development and raising or maintaining farm incomes , while protecting the natural resource base , need to be coherent , consistent and mutually supportive ;  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
WMO also organized jointly with EPPO and NAPPO symposia and workshops to give practical training in the use of meteorological data in the fight against pest and diseases , in reducing the level of undesired chemicals and in improving the quality of agricultural produce .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
Hundreds of settlements have been set on fire and destroyed ; government institutions , agricultural facilities and industrial enterprises , medical and consumer services , educational establishments , transport , power and water supply infrastructure and other important amenities have been plundered ; and the communications of the Azerbaijani State have been disrupted .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
The impact on women varies from the need to fit additional work into an already full and tiring day , to taking on the agricultural work of an absent husband , to additional responsibilities on a husband 's enlarged plot or new production scheme , to the loss of an independent income from her personal plot which has been taken over for family production .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
Programmes dealing with biosafety have expanded beyond the scientific sector to include the concerns of workers exposed to biological agents in the workplace ( ILO ) , farmers ( FAO ) and the general public , while programmes on marine agricultural and industrial biotechnology call for closer cooperation among FAO , ILO , the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) , UNEP , UNIDO , WHO and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
This has been a critical step forward in the context of translating project-induced increases in agricultural productivity and often a strengthened resource base into adequate diets for rural poor households .  
In the rural areas , where they are predominantly located in most of the developing regions except Latin America , they are the landless or near-landless illiterate agricultural workers , nomads , fishermen , pastoralists and forest dwellers who eke out a subsistence income from seasonal agricultural employment or from marginal lands and forests or from low-income non-farm work .  
Aware of the need to recognize the importance of an understanding of gender issues within all areas of agricultural , social , economic , environmental and political life in order to achieve a balanced division of roles and responsibilities and an equitable access to resources and to the benefits of development ,  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
Within the project on " Coastal Marine Pollution Monitoring and Training : Asia Pacific Mussel Watch " , UNU is seeking to analyse and monitor key hazardous chemicals and substances in the coastal marine areas of the Asia-Pacific region , including relative levels of important agricultural and industrial halogenated hydrocarbons in the eastern Pacific .  
Work under this subprogramme will be aimed at advancing consultations on the effects of adjustment policies , external openness and improved linkages with international markets on agricultural industries ; analysing the impact of increased participation by the agricultural sector in international markets on the public and private sectors ; and analysing recent experience in the agricultural land market , with special reference to the effects on promotion of small rural holdings .  
Such measures vary in range : pricing policies for agricultural inputs required by small farmers in raising their production ; policies regarding access to small credit facilities ; special measures required to make education accessible to children born in remote rural areas who participate in seasonal agricultural activities alongside adults ; elimination of legislative and bureaucratic barriers to the informal sector .  
In assessing costs for example of human resource development investments , the family decision-making structure will take into account inhibiting as well as motivating factors affecting their decisions to invest time in the schooling of girls , the opportunity costs of lost household or other ( e.g . agricultural , smallholding or commercial ) labour , or cultural / psychological stress on individuals as a consequence of non-traditional occupational or " career " choices .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .

NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
An effective government planning mechanism is essential if necessary social investment - especially for human-resource development - is to be well designed , and is even more essential for efficient government guidance of the investment process in those countries that choose to have activist industrial , agricultural or other sectoral policies .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
Cuba is not immune to the ideological effect of institutions such as self-employment , the agricultural and livestock market and , on another scale , foreign enterprises , with the concomitant national and foreign businessmen connected with the mixed import and export economy .  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
The wireless office for travelling professionals and mobile workers of all kinds seemed to be an almost inevitable trend , as the global economy increasingly shifted from agricultural and industrial employment to service-based employment dependent upon information and data rather than physical resources and specific locations .  
To enable the General Assembly to give appropriate support to that Summit , the Group of 77 and China urgently requested the inclusion of an additional sub-item , to be entitled " Food and sustainable agricultural development " , under item 95 , Sustainable development and international economic cooperation , and to be considered in its entirety by the Second Committee .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
Factors such as a strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates and have helped these countries to address some of the constraints facing their economies .  
The Committee was informed that the General Assembly , at its 55th plenary meeting on 10 November 1995 , decided to allocate to the Second Committee an additional sub-item entitled " Food and sustainable agricultural development " as sub-item ( k ) of agenda item 95 and the Committee agreed to begin its consideration of the new sub-item together with the scheduled cluster on Thursday , 16 November 1995 .  
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reported that the 1995 agricultural season has been significantly more successful than had been anticipated , in part because of both favourable weather conditions and the timely provision of agricultural support by the international donor community .  
The Committee noted that recent spin-offs of space technology included a light-weight metal cutter for emergency rescue operations , an automotive assembly fastener , a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide , a portable ultraviolet indicator , a new greenhouse for agricultural crops , new foods and medicines and honeycomb fireproof insulation material .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
While in the beginning of this partnership large amounts had to be contributed towards emergency measures , today the extensive bilateral development cooperation focuses mainly on the consolidation of structural adaptation processes , the rehabilitation of social infrastructures , the promotion of private enterprises ( including vocational training ) , agricultural development , and the protection of the environment and natural resources .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
They engaged in such hostile and provocative actions as breaking the sound barrier over civilian sites , dropping heat flares over agricultural land and intercepting and provoking Iraqi civilian vessels .  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
A strong expansion of agricultural production , internal stability , strong government commitments , a sound political and regulatory framework for development , complemented by significant external support , among other factors , have contributed to raising economic growth rates .  
However , administered or indicative maximum or minimum prices still exist in many countries of the region for selected agricultural exports or basic foodstuffs with the rationale of protecting the interests of the small farmers and the poor .  
Unless a new agricultural revolution is envisaged in the near future that would radically reduce the amount of water consumed in food production in hot countries ( currently about 3,000 cubic metres per ton of grain produced ) , it must be acknowledged as an urgent matter that there seems to be a definite limit to the human population that can be supported by the available water-supply . 
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
In terms of the poor penetration of agricultural areas that required specialized types of services , the Working Group stated that opportunities existed to provide alternative services such as radio communication systems , space or ground based .  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
Population density , availability of key natural resources , per capita income and urban and agricultural conditions differ between the crowded coastal plain and the less densely populated West Bank .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
However new problems have been appearing in rural areas with respect to restitution of private land ownership , transformation of agricultural cooperatives and reduced opportunities to find a city job by women coming from the province in the form of requirements for requalification and / or new professions available to provincial women , e.g . , new forms of gainful employment executable at home .  
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
On 4 July 1995 , UNDP , which since 1994 has been operating a project to support a solution to this problem with input from various bilateral and multilateral sources , organized , in association with former President Carter of the United States of America , a meeting of all the Nicaraguan actors involved : branches of Government , beneficiaries of agrarian and urban reform , owners of confiscated lands , holders of indemnification bonds , agricultural associations and political parties .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
Industry remains a vital instrument for economic and social progress , facilitating employment generation , contributing fundamentally to productivity growth and technological change , enabling the creation of dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors , and contributing to foreign-exchange earnings .  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
The presence of newly planted mines along some secondary roads which were previously considered safe is raising serious concerns among humanitarian agencies responsible for the distribution of agricultural assistance .  
In accordance with article 1 of the Code , these include industrial , trade and agricultural establishments and their dependencies , of whatever nature , whether public or private , religious or secular , even if they are of a professional or charitable nature ; liberal professions , craft establishments , cooperatives , civil law partnerships , unions , associations and groupings of any kind .  
These programmes have been accompanied by specific measures of equal importance dealing with social security , including in particular the reform of the industrial accident and occupational disease scheme , which has produced substantial improvements both in the extent of the cover and benefits , especially those paid to widows and orphans , and in the improvements made in the social security system in the agricultural sector . 
From the standpoint of improvement of agricultural productivity the optimal management of public land constitutes a priority means of substantially raising the contribution of such land to increased output and helping , by a multiplier effect , to disseminate advanced techniques .  Accordingly , a reform of the methods of managing this national land has been adopted after widespread national consultation .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
They agreed that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should jointly sponsor draft resolutions to be presented by the Group of 77 at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the following agenda items : trade and development , cooperation for industrial development , environment and sustainable development , human settlements , population and development , external debt crisis and development , food and sustainable agricultural development , an Agenda for Development and renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
In so saying , we acknowledge that many African countries have taken very considerable steps to improve their level of social and economic development , including undertaking structural economic reform to correct economic imbalances , increasing the priority given to social expenditures , providing social safety nets , improving the rights of women and children , protecting the environment , enhancing agricultural production and marketing processes , increasing food security and embracing democratic processes , as well as the introduction of good governance .  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
Notwithstanding the modest level of funding that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) has received for activities in this sector , the total collapse of the rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , WFP has had remarkable success in assisting in the relaunching of food production .  
Deeply concerned at the widespread and disastrous consequences of the economic sanctions imposed against Burundi for the national economy , public finances and agricultural production and for the health and the education , at all levels , of its population ,  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
In 25 years , the population debate has evolved dramatically from a narrow focus on population size and growth rates to a more integrated agenda embracing demographic structures , distribution patterns and urbanization , levels of exploitation of natural resources , and creation of viable agricultural and industrial infrastructures .  
Likewise , suburban sprawl , which has led to increased consumption of fossil fuel through extended commuting , disturbs the fragile ecosystems and permanently removes prime arable land from agricultural production .  
Environmentally induced migrations are caused by natural disasters , such as earthquakes , flash flooding , typhoons , and volcanic eruptions ; by nuclear and hazardous waste contamination ; by agricultural and rural decline , resource pollution , chronic water shortages ; or by dam construction and other large-scale development projects .  
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Implementation is usually directed towards both increasing economic opportunity - for example , through land reform and land rehabilitation , strengthening the agricultural sector , education and training , job creation , and access to seed capital - and towards providing a social safety net , through the provision of shelter and support to community groups and broad participation in decision-making .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Decide to work towards evolving principles based on sound management of hazardous wastes so as to develop national policies to phase out toxic agricultural and industrial chemicals and trade in hazardous waste ;  
The most dangerous agricultural pest , the pink mealy bug , is being controlled by bio-control agents a hybrid beetle and a parasitic wasp .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
Recognizing the widespread nature of the practice of forced evictions and that when forced evictions are carried out they can occur in a variety of contexts including but not limited to conflicts over land rights , development and infrastructure projects , such as the construction of dams or other large _ scale energy projects , land acquisition measures associated with urban renewal , housing renovation , city beautification programmes , the clearing of land for agricultural purposes or macro-urban projects , unbridled speculation in land , and the holding of major international events such as the Olympic Games ,  
Concern about slack growth and mounting social problems led the Government to decide early in March on a new economic orientation , including promotion of investment and elimination of all obstacles to investment by Lebanese and foreigners ; protection of agriculture through limiting imports of competing agricultural products ; and selection and protection of competitive industries , which have an export potential , which will be supported to ensure increased productivity .  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
Recognizing , however , the importance of agricultural development no only for people living in rural areas but as an engine of growth , the Bank had formulated during the past year a new action plan for rural development , designed to address current problems and to provide a new and dynamic framework for future Bank activities in that area .  The plan had just been presented to the Bank 's Board of Directors .  
The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
This is fully in line with the predominant role of the agricultural sector in African economies , the potential for long-term comparative advantage of agro-based production , the multiple linkages between the industrial and agricultural sectors and their potential socioeconomic / economic impact through SMEs and informal-sector activities , particularly in rural areas .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
Despite the collapse of rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , a number of projects are being implemented to support an increase in overall food production among settled farming communities , nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists , returnees and vulnerable groups .  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
The speaker listed several issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( iv ) trade in services .  
The speaker listed a number of issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) debt burden ; ( iv ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( v ) trade in services .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
Recurrent drought in the southern Africa region this decade , the weak economic base of the country , which is almost exclusively agricultural , a rather unbalanced social infrastructure , which is partly due to the low literacy rate inherited from the previous regime , and the problem of disease , including HIV / AIDS , pose a serious threat to our nascent democracy .  
A low rate of economic growth ; intense demographic pressures ; a decline in agricultural production ; the continuing decrease in bilateral and multilateral aid the result of new alliances ; the burden of debt servicing ; and socio-political conflicts these are the many pitfalls along the path to Africa 's development . 
The Action Strategy begins with measures representing a set of possible early priority interventions , including land title reform ; a new agricultural development initiative and special agricultural economic zones ; promotion of new manufacturing investment through relocation of labour-intensive industries to create industrial estates in the region ; introduction of modern and appropriate technologies ; marketing systems ; and human resource development , including improved skills . 
While India is forging ahead with its policy of economic reform and liberalization , public policy is being re-oriented towards supporting agricultural growth , building up infrastructure and ensuring universal access to basic minimum services like health , education , drinking water , food and nutrition , shelter and so on .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
Since rural energy problems persist and energy is not playing its full role as a motor for rural development , the following issues have emerged as complementary priorities or as new areas of focus : ( a ) more emphasis on the micro or household level ; ( b ) renewed interest in eco-village projects , solar villages etc . ; ( c ) promotion of innovative financial schemes to promote small businesses ; and ( d ) emphasis on the impact of rural energy on agricultural productivity .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
In satellite agrometeorology , work is continuing to provide a prompt service to users at different hierarchical levels , furnishing information on the condition of agricultural sown crops which is obtained by processing and interpreting data received from meteorological satellites .  
The Penal Code lays down offences of an ecological nature , dealing , for example , with the unlawful destruction of raw materials , trees , agricultural or industrial products or means of production , such destruction being detrimental to national wealth or consumption , as well as with the protection of mammals or marine vertebrates and aquatic species .  
UNTMIH paved the way for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to Haiti 's long-term development , meshing security concerns with technical assistance and a whole range of environmental , agricultural , educational and administrative reform programmes .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
According to article III of its Memorandum and Articles of Association , the main objectives of the Centre are to develop well researched policy options on land reform , rural development and agricultural reform to influence the policies of a future administration ; to facilitate the analysis of existing policies and alternative policy proposals relating to this sector ; to provide options for the reorientation of policy-making towards a democratic order ; to collect data and develop and manage a comprehensive information system concerning land and agricultural issues and including all existing research .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
In South-East Asia strong economic growth along with a relatively large and rapidly expanding population base has attracted a great deal of interest from Western investors in all areas of the agricultural and food chain , especially in processing and distribution .  Although the level of imports in most cases is relatively low for processed horticultural products , in some markets ( e.g .  
The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern with regard to several important socio-economic issues , including youth unemployment , the high rate of female migration , decreased export earnings in the agricultural sector , the high rate of pregnancy among pre-teenagers and adolescents , traditional socio-cultural attitudes reflecting stereotyped gender roles and the prevalence of domestic violence .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
Recently , many developing countries have abandoned the policy of supporting industrialization by maintaining agricultural prices low across the board and left prices to be determined on the market , expecting that resources would thus be allocated efficiently and market opportunities would be exploited .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
In order to curb rapid loss of biodiversity , the deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled so as to reverse the serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
To curb rapid loss of biodiversity , deforestation caused by agricultural expansion and overharvesting of forests must be controlled to reverse the continuing serious environmental consequences of lost tree cover and downstream impacts on marine areas .  
There were fewer women than men in the labour force , mainly because many women were engaged in child rearing , and much of the unpaid female work in the agricultural sector was not generally recorded as economic activity .  
According to a survey commissioned by the Office for Rural Development in 1993 , rural women employed in agricultural activities worked an average of 12 hours and 58 minutes a day , of which a mere 4 hours were devoted to household management and domestic work .  
In a similar vein , many agricultural products are controlled ( although this is changing rapidly ) with , for example , fixed or minimum or maximum prices , central marketing councils , and surplus removal schemes .  
Before the crisis , while the north remained underdeveloped and sparsely populated , almost all agricultural , manufacturing , trade and tourism , as well as educational and cultural activities , were concentrated inside or within a few kilometres of Plymouth .  
The system of municipal and prefectural agricultural committees , which played a central role in agricultural land reform as the primary administrative organization , was also revised .  
Governments must provide the political and legal framework for sound environmental management and for agricultural and industrial development policies that take into account current and foreseeable health needs .  
The concentration of shifting cultivators on a smaller or poorer resource base typically sets in motion a downward spiral of reduced agricultural productivity , increased forest depletion and worsened rural poverty , as cropland fallow periods are shortened and soil fertility declines .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
Mass poverty resulted from factors such as a shortage of productive resources , limited access to basic services and poor output and lack of diversification in the agricultural sector .  Those factors eroded the economic and social fabric of populations and drastically reduced the options of poor sectors .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
For example , in Thailand , women working on family-owned land under contract to multinational companies earned cash income for the first time after years of unpaid labour in intensive rice cultivation . 15 However , the vertical integration of the agricultural sector which comes with the involvement of multinational corporations makes rural household food security vulnerable to market fluctuations . 
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
In spite of temporary difficulties caused by the destruction of health and education facilities and industrial and agricultural infrastructure as a result of the natural disasters of recent successive years , our people are full of courage and are firmly convinced that under the Great Leader and our social system they can repair the damage in the shortest possible time and build a rich and strong country .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
Total support is " the annual monetary value of all gross transfers from taxpayers and consumers arising from policy measures which support agriculture , net of associated budgetary receipts " , and producer support is " the annual monetary value of gross transfers from consumers and taxpayers to agricultural producers , measured at farmgate level , arising from policy measures regardless of their nature , objectives or impacts on farm production and income . 
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
The factors driving these conflicts which the Seminar identified showed why internal conflicts clearly predominate : ethnic rivalries , general decline in the rule of law , democratic shortcomings on the part of the political authorities , defective governance policies , poverty and underdevelopment , identity-based political demands , politicization of ethnicity , shortcomings in reintegrating former combatants , lack of access to agricultural land , economic difficulties and other factors .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
The Board observed that , in the short to medium term , improved agricultural performance offered many of the least developed countries the most effective way to raise economic growth rates and expand and diversify exports .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .  
Thus , Africas struggle to achieve rapid economic transformation will be lost or won depending on how effectively industrial development is linked with agricultural development through enhanced manufacturing value added , productivity and competitiveness , with an accent on employment and income generation .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .  
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Commodities continue to provide an important economic starting base : they have a high value-added component ; agricultural commodities are an important source of employment and offer scope for anti-poverty campaigns ; and agriculture frequently acts as a buffer against economic problems and allows the return to rural areas of urban unemployed , as in the current crisis .  
While its close-knit families and strong agricultural base had enabled Thailand to weather the 1997 financial crisis , the existing social safety nets had been severely tested and the crisis had served as a reminder that social development could not be treated as secondary to economic development .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea said that the development of LDCs had been constrained by shortcomings in the physical infrastructure and human resource development , low levels of domestic resources , and poor performance in the agricultural sector .  
Statistics showed that female-headed households constituted 47 per cent of the rural and 29 per cent of the urban population living below the poverty line , and that women represented a disproportionate share of the agricultural labour force , but controlled only 38 per cent of its operations . 
With regard to the right to an adequate standard of living , the Syrian Arab Republic has shown special concern for the agricultural sector in view of its important role in the economic development process , since it constitutes the principal source of every individual 's vital requirements such as food and clothing .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and the dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
The Chinese trajectory , however , where these factors are absent , also points to the decisive role of State capacity in the virtuous growth path that accompanied gradual and uneven institutional reforms over a period of two decades ( as exemplified in the agricultural reforms , the open-door policy , the transitional dual-track regime in industry and the change in the fiscal system Chavance , forthcoming in 2000 ) .  
Those decisions reflected the political and economic interests of those States , as illustrated by the fact that , in February 1990 , the United States Administration imposed restrictions on the fulfilment of contracts for agricultural and industrial shipments which had been concluded with Iraq six months earlier .  
As soon as a list is drawn up , humanitarian items such as foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals and medical supplies , as well as basic or standard medical and agricultural equipment and educational items , will no longer be submitted to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for approval .  
In developing countries , atomic energy with its multiple applications in power generation , improving health standards , enhancing the quality and quantity of agricultural yields , pest controls and water resources management is seen as the key to a better future .  
It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
The theme From farm to factory for a better future embodies my firm belief that Africa , with its endowment of diverse agricultural resources , most of which are industrial raw materials that could be transformed to provide adequate food for the peoples of Africa , could simultaneously improve agricultural productivity , as well as increase utilization of its manufacturing capacity for food security .  
Protect the health of women workers in all sectors , including agricultural and domestic household workers , through effective environmental and occupational health policies for gender-sensitive work environments , free from sexual harassment and discrimination , which are safe and ergonomically designed to prevent occupational hazards ;  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
A subsequent project identified the major causes for erosion and the high sedimentation of the Rewa River , and elaborated a detailed programme combining legal aspects , flood control , river regulation and appropriate land management practices for sustainable development of agricultural lands .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
the expressed satisfaction of policy makers and authorities with the quality of services and advice rendered in connection with rural development , agricultural policies , industrial competitiveness , entrepreneurial development and energy integration and management , as well as with the contribution to enhanced coordination and collaboration with regional organizations and bodies . 19.129 During the biennium 20002001 , the following outputs will be delivered : 
Having recognized that limited access to credit by SMEs is a major constraint on production and growth , many Governments directed public funds to SMEs through specialized financial institutions , such as agricultural and industrial development banks .  
Such a decision ignored the erosion of trade preferences , the CARICOM countries ecological and economic vulnerability and the fact that most of their economies lacked the resilience to recover quickly from natural disasters which could obliterate their physical infrastructure , industrial base and agricultural assets . 
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Formal technical presentations during the first of the three sessions focused on the role of remote sensing in achieving national food security , mapping from space , agricultural applications of small satellites , as well as recent trends in remote sensing and meteorological and global navigation satellite systems .  
The Conference noted that two principal benefits that effective sharing of information would allow were ( a ) the ready retrieval of information on demonstration projects that could raise the awareness of decision makers ; and ( b ) the relative ease for countries in the region to carry out comparisons of operational agricultural methodologies in order to make decisions that would improve the effectiveness of their national programmes .  
In light of increased demand for urban and related infrastructure developments , Luxembourg has developed regional and national land management planning schemes so as to set aside land for the exclusive use of agricultural production .  
Export subsidies should be outlawed , domestic producer subsidies reduced , access under tariff quotas increased , tariff escalation on processed agricultural products removed , and the level and dispersion of bound tariffs on agricultural imports reduced .  
At the national level , poverty eradication was the official objective of the ninth fiveyear plan , which included decentralization , agricultural development and integrated agroforestry development .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
The objective is to enable African countries to achieve economic and social development through accelerated human and institutional capacity development as well as agricultural and private sector development .  
Given the limited size of the domestic market and the unstable conditions of the international market , the major difficulty faced by Viet Nams agricultural sector is to find markets for its increased production .  
A major reason for the limited growth of agricultural trade has been protection : bound tariffs on agricultural products are , on average , at the same level as bound tariffs on industrial products 50 years ago .  
This vast territory which has immense natural ( mineral , agricultural , forestry , energy and other ) resources continues to have some of the lowest social indicators in the world and is classified among the poorest countries in the world . 
FAO designed a regional project on increasing rural womens food productivity through improved agricultural technology transfer and adoption in Africa , involving relevant United Nations agencies and selected countries in the region .  
It also imposed harsh restrictions that prevented the population living under occupation from farming and benefiting from its agricultural land , and destroyed mature , productive trees .  
This concerned , inter alia , enhanced agricultural production ; increasing value of education systems ; improving the quality of health care and contribution to good governance ( e.g . local institutions often play a vital role in improving post-conflict situations ) .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Faced with the continuing low price of wool , the Department of Agriculture is endeavouring to encourage agricultural diversification , while programmes related to wool production and marketing continue to be a major focus , among them the Agricultural Subsistence and Incentive Scheme , designed to provide financial support and to assist in the improvement of existing farming operations or the development of new farm-based enterprises and the Pasture Improvement Programme .  
Recognizing that agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa required a radical shift from traditional thinking and approaches , coupled with in-depth empirical understanding of local environmental and socio-economic conditions , WARDA began to develop technologies that were adapted to the sub-Saharan Africa environment without modifying that environment to fit the technology .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
These included : the worsening of the food security problem ; the structural difficulty of achieving competitiveness within the current international agricultural markets ; and the strong dependency on exports from this sector for the acquisition of hard currency .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
In the long term , the agricultural production base of developing countries should be improved , and in the short term , bilateral and multilateral food aid schemes should be strengthened .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
For the majority of the CEE region countries not so affected by direct desertification but faced by land degradation and so on , the major tasks are , inter alia , to establish and maintain the optimum proportions of arable land , meadows , pastures , forests and water areas in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and the capacity of the environment , to decrease over-cultivation of agricultural land through selective afforestation , bio-corridors or establishment of grasslands .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas , with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being , and in this regard encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;
