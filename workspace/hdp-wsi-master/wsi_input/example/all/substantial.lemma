As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
Their economic and social achievements have raised their international credit standing to such a degree that it induces very substantial private investment and financial flows .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The Secretary stressed that the urgent need for , and potential costs of , additional office space would be among the most important matters to be addressed during the remainder of 1997 and in the long-term concept paper on administrative arrangements to be presented to the Board in 1998 .  31 .  The Secretary also indicated that the inevitable result of changing significantly the administrative arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations would be a substantial increase in the administrative expenses to be charged against the resources of the Fund .  
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 , 1994 and , more recently , in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
The events of 28 September 1995 , during which an army of international mercenaries invaded my country , overthrew the President of the Republic , disrupted constitutional order and , consequently , State institutions , further worsened our economic crisis and led to substantial material losses and structural damage .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of peace and security ; strengthened and broadened the observance of human rights ; enhanced and developed international law and widened the scope of international penal law , in particular ; and laid the foundations for greater responsibility by States in the advancement of social progress .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
When substantial amounts of money are embezzled by dishonest officials , there is an indirect effect on the economic , social and cultural rights of the people , whose urgent needs might have been partially met with the unlawfully appropriated sums .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
Aside from the emotional and psychological effects of deep and prolonged grief exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty over the fate of their loved ones , there are often substantial socio-economic effects borne especially by dependent women .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
The representative of the Netherlands also expressed the view that the consolidated text was acceptable as a bare minimum , and that , after resolving the remaining issue , it should be adopted by the Working Group without substantial debate and changes .

Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .

That initiative , which benefitted from substantial Government funding , had been very well received by organizations of the civil society and was the basis for the action to be taken to establish , under the supervision of an independent body composed of governmental and non-governmental representatives , minimum rules for the treatment of offenders .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
What was needed was an innovative , effective and lasting approach , based on a common set of principles for future debt negotiations , which would include arrangements for a substantial reduction of all categories of debt .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
However , the conduct must go beyond speech which simply angered or distressed : it must be sufficiently persistent and pernicious as to inflict ( or be motivated by a desire to inflict ) substantial emotional or physical harm .  
The other half include mainly fuels , minerals , wood , other basic commodities and intermediate inputs required by industry , as well as certain tropical and fishery products of substantial export interest to a wide range of developing countries .  
During the first half of the year , the region was receiving substantial private credit inflows on a net basis , continuing a trend that had started in 1996 owing to low international interest rates and improving growth prospects .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities are punishable in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties are imposed .

Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
The Committee also recommended that efforts be intensified in order to establish a vigorous plan of increased mobilization of resources directed at the eradication of poverty , economic development , substantial reduction of debt , institution of partnership innovations , market access and trade opportunities , mobilization of domestic resources and allocation of additional resources .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
While the developing countries had utilized their own resources in order to achieve the basic objective of sustainable development , it was clear that those efforts would be inadequate without substantial support from the international community .  
Notes that the United Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but are facing economic hardship ;  
Despite the appalling number of dead ( see below ) , a substantial majority of Cambodians survived this period , although the long-term impact on the country remains incalculable because the educated and skilled were especially targeted and because of the psychological and physical scars left on the survivors .  
The 1997 Task Force reported that substantial problems have arisen as a result , and recommended that information centre staff become a communications services group under the resident coordinator , who would be responsible to the head of the Department for developing a plan for how the United Nations global themes can best be adapted and articulated locally ( see report of the Task Force ) .  
The unencumbered balance of $ 2,556,300 gross ( $ 2,216,500 net ) was attributable to the delayed deployment of civilian personnel , fewer rotation of military observers and a substantial portion of the Missions equipment requirements being obtained through transfers from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
In view of the substantial withdrawal of MONUA military units and observers , logistical support provided by the Observer Mission to the civilian police component was augmented both in terms of geographical coverage and the increased number of police observers , which reached their authorized strength of 345 by October 1998 .  
The Commission agreed that achievement of these commitments requires substantial improvement in access , delivery , quality and financing of social services , and recommended that the General Assembly at its special session reinforce those commitments by considering national strategies and supportive international policies necessary for their achievement .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
For operational reasons , in view of a substantial quantity of military-pattern equipment provided to the MINURCA military contingents by the Government of France as a voluntary contribution in kind , increased provisions are also made for the supply under letter-of-assist arrangements of essential required spare parts and other matriel required to maintain those assets .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal [ corporate ] persons may be punished in an effective , proportionate and deterrent manner and that substantial economic penalties may be imposed on them .  
The Council informed Mr . Rugova of its current efforts to solve the Kosovo crisis through a political settlement that would provide for the safe return of all refugees and for substantial self-government for Kosovo within the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and help abate the overheated nationalist sentiments now prevailing in the area .  
Accounts received by the High Commissioner and OHCHR staff in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Albania and Montenegro ( Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) provide substantial evidence of gross human rights violations which have been committed in Kosovo , including summary executions , forcible displacement , rape , physical abuse , and the destruction of property and identity documents .  
In a shared vision , the United Nations system should aim to work for a world in which HIV / AIDS transmission is substantially reduced ; where there is affordable treatment , care and support ; where there is a substantial reduction in individual and collective vulnerability to HIV / AIDS ; where there is a significant alleviation of the adverse impact of the epidemic on individuals , communities , and nations ; and where stigma and denial are addressed .  
However , she made an oral presentation at that session , in which she highlighted the essential elements of her study , discussed her ideas on the purpose , scope , sources and structure of her future report , and expressed her wish to elaborate on them further in the framework of a substantial preliminary report , to be submitted to the Sub-Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
Should the exigencies of the service permit , and subject to the prior approval of the Secretary-General , occasional compensatory time off may be granted to staff members serving at established offices in the Professional category who have been required to work substantial or recurrent periods of overtime .  
The report concluded that there were substantial institutional deficiencies and that although further legislative change was required in such fields as employment and criminal and family law , such change alone would not remove the main impediments to the rule of law , which were rooted in the political environment of the court system .  
The world economy was growing well below its potential , a large number of developing countries were stagnant or had a declining GDP , prices of many primary commodities were at unusually low levels , social conditions in crisis countries had suffered serious setbacks , and downside risks were substantial .  
These effects also included the extinction ( or substantial reduction ) of their territorial base and undermined their political , economic , juridical , cultural and social order in general , and even their survival as a distinct society .  
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Reaffirms that untied core resources are the bedrock of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and , in this context , calls on Governments to take steps to address the urgent and immediate need for a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , reflecting the increasing needs of developing countries , taking into account the development of multi-year funding frameworks ;  
In accordance with the international standards , " a substantial autonomy " implies that some specific powers and rights , such as the right to the use of language , education and information in one 's own tongue , protection and fostering of one 's own culture and tradition as well as local administration affairs , are transferred to the autonomous region , which takes place within the framework of a broader constitutional and legal order in a sovereign State .  
As mentioned above , in most situations of realizing human rights in a particular country , there is so much waste and inefficient use of domestic resources that substantial progress can be made in improving the realization of most human rights even within the existing resources , which can be augmented by international cooperation for which a call has been given explicitly in the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Under international standards " substantial autonomy " implies that some specific competencies and rights , such as the right of minorities to use and receive education and information in their own language , as well as the right to protect and foster individual culture and tradition and the affairs concerning the local administration , are transferred to the field of autonomy within the wider constitutional and legal order of a sovereign State . 
In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
While the Committee is aware of the efforts undertaken by the State party to allocate substantial financial resources for the benefit of children , it reiterates its concern ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 24 , para . 8 ) that stringent budgetary measures and external debt , as well as the persistence of widespread poverty and uneven income distribution , are still having a negative impact on the situation of children in the State party .  
While the Committee is aware that the full implementation of the new juvenile justice system requires substantial financial and human resources as well as the development of infrastructure , as established in the document entitled Transformation and investment in the human rights of children and adolescents ( May 1999 ) , it remains concerned that the juvenile justice system is not fully implemented .  
The simple classification of a country as a net exporter or net importer could , however , be misleading in understanding the country-specific impact of the Agreement , as many NFIDCs also had a substantial level of export interest in specific commodities ( mainly cash-crop commodities such as coffee , tea , cotton , soy beans and sugar ) in terms of their shares of total export earnings .  
The international community , particularly the developed countries , collectively committed itself to a significant and substantial increase in supporting the efforts of the least developed countries to mobilize and develop their human capacities and the development of their economic base .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
A country improves its chances of success in the struggle to reduce poverty when it achieves strong , sustained economic growth which creates a substantial expansion in the number of high-productivity jobs ; when the incomes such growth generates are also helped by a policy aimed at defending their purchasing power through low inflation ; and when support also exists in the form of significant programmes of well focused public transfers .  
But I will repeat one clear and uncontested truth : a cut _ off treaty will make a substantial , vital and practical contribution to advancing the goal of global nuclear disarmament .  
During this time of increased calls for international resources for Kosovo and other parts of the world , when donor fatigue for Bosnia and Herzegovina is very real , the continued unwillingness of substantial parts of the local leadership to create conditions conducive to returns and to the integral implementation of the Dayton peace agreement can not be tolerated . 
The first is the pledge of $ 220-million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Kosovo and neighbouring countries ; and the second is a pledge announced yesterday in Tokyo for a preliminary $ 2-million to meet immediate humanitarian needs for East Timor , to be followed by further assistance in response to any future appeal , as well as substantial financial contributions to the United Nations trust fund to support the multinational force established by the Security Council resolution . 
C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
As the principal forum of the United Nations for the integrated treatment of development and interrelated issues in the areas of trade , finance , investment , technology and sustainable development , UNCTAD is expected to make a substantial contribution to the pursuit of the international communitys common development objectives .  
It concluded that , after nearly three decades of substantial change in global economic and social conditions in the cooperative movement and in the relations between it and Governments , there was need to change the tone and emphasis of the Recommendation to reassess the underlying concepts of aid to cooperatives and to include matters not addressed by it .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .

Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;

Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
That gesture had a double symbolism , as it expressed the traditional friendship between the Cyprus and Palestinian peoples and constituted a concrete manifestation of the progress in the peace process and of the need for substantial steps to improve the standard of living of the Palestinian people .  
A vital element in the development and improvement of the Division is the appointment of a Director at the D-2 level with extensive experience and sound knowledge in procurement , logistics and contracting , including substantial managerial experience in these areas at the international level , as well as a proven ability and record of strategic planning .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
Fiscal regimes applied to natural resources have a long way to go in discouraging the excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources and / or mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources for sustainable development .  
In practice , the ongoing reform of natural resource fiscal regimes in various countries has a long way to go in mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources and at the same time discouraging excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .

This continuing rise in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases poses potentially substantial risks to global physical and ecological systems , human health and socio-economic sectors .  
Donors need to expeditiously implement the agreed menu of aid targets and / or commitments as set out in paragraph 23 of the Programme of Action 1 / and fulfil their commitments to provide a significant and substantial increase in the aggregate level of external support to LDCs , keeping in mind the increased needs of these countries , as well as the requirements of the new countries included in the list of LDCs following the Paris Conference .  
We are convinced that only a substantial improvement in the social and economic situation in a situation of national reconciliation can create the right conditions for a democratic , stable and secure Haiti to develop .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
Most of the developed countries draw on large shares of crude oil and natural gas in their primary energy consumption ; some regions have substantial contributions of nuclear energy and modern renewable sources .

As at May 1996 , in the eleventh month of intensive volcanic activity , the Territory is facing an uncertain future with a substantial part of its population relocated and its economy disrupted .  
There has been substantial progress in the establishment of a physical planning unit to direct natural resource management and in the preparation of an environmental profile of the island and an inventory of its historical , archaeological , cultural and natural resources .  
Cuba considers that the considerable problems with anti-personnel mines experienced by a number of third world countries are due in large part , if we limit ourselves to the most direct causes , to the unscrupulous export policies which have been extensively practised by several developed countries ; these have made substantial profits from such operations and taken little account of the impact on the civilian populations of many countries .  
While ECOWAS Foreign Ministers have identified the requisite conditions to ensure free and fair elections , we attach great importance to the full independence of the electoral Commission and to disarmament substantial enough so that the free participation of the Liberian people in the democratic process will not be constrained .  
The health issues included in the Platform for Action were already part of the Ninth General Programme of Work of WHO and technical programmes have continued with their activities as planned although , given current resource constraints , substantial additional funding is not anticipated .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Mobilization of substantial new and additional resources from all sources , domestic and international , public and private , and from traditional and new sources would also be instrumental .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;

While the State bears the cost of wages and supplementary social charges for no fewer than 14 days when work is suspended ( decree No . 1447 of 31 December 1987 ) , to enable public officials to celebrate a variety of religious , political and social holidays , private enterprises would find it difficult to support such charges , which place a substantial burden on production costs .  
These programmes have been accompanied by specific measures of equal importance dealing with social security , including in particular the reform of the industrial accident and occupational disease scheme , which has produced substantial improvements both in the extent of the cover and benefits , especially those paid to widows and orphans , and in the improvements made in the social security system in the agricultural sector . 
It would be wholly unrealistic and even irresponsible to believe that , following the 1994 genocide which claimed the lives of between 500,000 and 1-million persons and involved substantial destruction of Rwanda 's infrastructure as well as ensuing instability and violence arising from continuing insurgency and counter-insurgency operations , anything less than sustained remedial efforts can bring about long-lasting improvement in the human rights situation .  
Among these indicators , the following should figure : substantial and regular respect for the right to life and physical integrity exercised by public agents of the Republic of Rwanda ; effective functioning of the judicial system at all levels ; conformity of arrest and detention practices with international human rights standards ; and humane conditions of detention throughout Rwanda .  
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
Despite the continuing invasion and occupation of a substantial part of its territory , Cyprus was a sponsor of various useful meetings and seminars dealing with a wide range of economic and development issues , and , in that connection , his delegation agreed that a " new and equitable partnership " must be based on equality and that economic cooperation for development must be the central objective of that process .  
The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expresses grave concern that in Nigeria today substantial judicial power , particularly in the administration of criminal justice , is vested in the military and special ad hoc tribunals to the exclusion of the ordinary courts . 
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
Lastly , the pay-offs through greater mutual understanding and confidence gained in subregional economic cooperation and factor mobility may be intangible , but they generate substantial positive , highly visible and collective external benefits for ED , networking and integration among the collaborating or participating countries in the long run .  
Any church or place for religious assembly built and operated without authorization is liable to be closed and put under seal and those responsible for the " illegal " installation may be prosecuted , imprisoned and required to pay a substantial fine .  
Notes that the recent heavily indebted poor countries initiative represents a step towards assisting countries with substantial debt problems , while stressing the urgent need to ensure an expeditious , flexible , constructive and full implementation of the initiative that is in line with the need for comprehensive approaches ;  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;

However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
Copper prices , additionally , lost considerable ground after disclosures of substantial losses by a large Japanese company in trades of derivative financial instruments linked to copper , amid widely publicized speculation that the company controlled large unreported stocks of copper that had been used to manipulate market prices and prices of the derivative instruments .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;

Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
Their economic and social achievements have raised their international credit standing to such a degree that it induces very substantial private investment and financial flows .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,

At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The Secretary stressed that the urgent need for , and potential costs of , additional office space would be among the most important matters to be addressed during the remainder of 1997 and in the long-term concept paper on administrative arrangements to be presented to the Board in 1998 .  31 .  The Secretary also indicated that the inevitable result of changing significantly the administrative arrangements between the Fund and the United Nations would be a substantial increase in the administrative expenses to be charged against the resources of the Fund .  
The Expert Meeting welcomed the initiative of the UNCTAD secretariat in arranging for the participation of a substantial number of actors from the business community in its deliberations , and encouraged UNCTAD to continue to involve private sector representatives in its future dialogues and to facilitate contacts and promote interaction among business people .  1 .  The Expert Meeting observed that the growth of international food trade had been high , at almost 7 per cent a year during the previous 10 years , not much lower than that of trade in manufactured goods .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development .

The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Convinced of the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and determined to take new steps forward , nationally and with the increased cooperation and solidarity of the international community , with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights ,  
A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 , 1994 and , more recently , in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
The events of 28 September 1995 , during which an army of international mercenaries invaded my country , overthrew the President of the Republic , disrupted constitutional order and , consequently , State institutions , further worsened our economic crisis and led to substantial material losses and structural damage .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
We have taken substantial strides towards the ideal of peace and security ; strengthened and broadened the observance of human rights ; enhanced and developed international law and widened the scope of international penal law , in particular ; and laid the foundations for greater responsibility by States in the advancement of social progress .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
When substantial amounts of money are embezzled by dishonest officials , there is an indirect effect on the economic , social and cultural rights of the people , whose urgent needs might have been partially met with the unlawfully appropriated sums .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
Aside from the emotional and psychological effects of deep and prolonged grief exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty over the fate of their loved ones , there are often substantial socio-economic effects borne especially by dependent women .  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
The representative of the Netherlands also expressed the view that the consolidated text was acceptable as a bare minimum , and that , after resolving the remaining issue , it should be adopted by the Working Group without substantial debate and changes .

Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;
