They are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy-decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .  However , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .  
We must be clearly aware that we are still faced with arduous tasks and severe challenges in our current efforts to realize the grand target of China 's modernization building and narrow China 's development gap with the world 's advanced development level .  Therefore , we have no reason whatsoever to be conceited and complacent , or cease to go any further ;  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
How can they allow their constantly improving livelihood be jeopardized by the Dalai . In the questionnaires , the residents in the Chengguan District of Lhasa City have given a resounding answer .  They , as well as the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , are deeply aware that the blind religious worship people have for the Dalai Lama , who has ulterior motives , has not only stifled their ideas but also shackled their hands and feet ;  
Wang Faqiang , vice president of the Armed Police General Hospital , who has personally saved the lives of over 1,300 patients in all kinds of critical conditions , said that as medical workers , duty-bound to heal the wounded and rescue the dying , I and my colleagues are deeply aware that human beings are the most precious .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
He paid close attention to launching a struggle against ethnic separatism , being aware of the collusion between a handful of ethnic separatist elements at home and abroad and international anti-China forces to carry out separatist and disruptive activities against our country .  
Only when the majority of young officers and soldiers have a sense of urgency being aware that time waits for no man , making diligent efforts to become high-quality military professionals and striving to improve their own quality can they keep up with rapid development in the global field of military science and technology and genuinely fulfill their sacred mission of revitalizing the military and serving the motherland .  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
We should not only be aware of the significant development and the significant contributions , but also profoundly understand the substantial significance for the practice and the guiding role .  In this way , we can comprehensively and accurately master the ideological and theoretical system and lay down a solid theoretical and ideological foundation for Party members to conscientiously put their advanced nature into practice .  
Information from military sources has disclosed that the development program of the medium-range ballistic missile , undertaken by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology [ CIST ] , is a top secret .  Very few officials in the military know about it .  However , some foreign think tank personages have verified it from the Ministry of Defense [ MND ] officials , and there are signs that the number of people who are aware of the program is increasing .  
To align the personal quality of these professional soldiers with the requirements of the rank of nomcom as soon as possible , people who have obtained the rank of noncom must understand their position and role in military construction , be aware of their duties and have a strong sense of urgency regarding learning information about organization , training , and education and about administrating soldiers , so as to improve their overall quality in the military and in political fields .  
However , we should be clearly aware of the existing problems : Today , an insufficient effective demand and an irrational economic structure still remain predominant problems , no new consumption hot spot is expected in the near future , problems accumulated over the years in the country 's economic life have been exposed in a concentrated way , and there are still many uncertainties in the international market .  All these problems ought to be brought to our close attention .  
After the sugar coating was licked off , what one may taste was only the bitterness inside .  If the voters are aware of the sugar coating and the packing , then they should know that even though opposing dark gold politics , restoring law and order , and reforming government were all what they required , if these objectives were to be achieved only by means of establishing a so-called Taiwan people 's state , then nothing would really be accomplished .  
By engaging in separatist activities , Lee has been unable to open a dialogue with Beijing and has even pushed cross-strait relations to a tense confrontation .  Chen is fully aware of this .  If he carries forward Lee 's botched policy , he will be in a more terrible plight than Lee is .

- - We must uphold Marxism , most importantly upholding scientific tenets and scientific spirit along with the innovative spirit of Marxism , be adept at becoming aware of and studying forward moving new situations and new questions based on changes in the objective situation , continually drawing nourishment from the fresh experiences of the masses created in practice , and continually advancing and improving our work . 
To be sure , we are fully aware that China is a developing country with over 1.2 billion inhabitants , a weak economic base , a low per-capita output value , and imbalance between its different parts in their economic development standards .  Therefore , we have put forth an important strategy to promote the development of west China .  
We should be aware that with the arrival of an information era and the promotion of global integration , a war will gradually no longer be ignited by traditional disputes .  Western countries headed by the United States are looking for new causes for provoking a war or military intervention .  They are now in the stage of theoretical exploration and tests .  The Kosovo War and the wars started by NATO previously are new adjustments made to achieve this aim .  
We should , laying stress on youngsters and " high-risk groups , " go down to universities as well as middle and primary schools ; to public security lockups , reeducation-through-labor centers , detention centers , and rehabilitation centers ; and to residential districts , rural areas , enterprises , and public institutions to properly conduct preventive education on narcotics through various integrated measures to make every family and individual aware of the matter .  
But we should also be aware that some issues and difficulties do exist in the work of people 's courts , particularly courts at the grassroots level .  The cases in point are their failure to cope with the profound changes in economic , social , ideological , and cultural aspects .  
At the same time , however , we should also be clearly aware that some state enterprises are still faced with great difficulties , and the task of deepening reform remains extremely arduous .  In view of this , we must act in line with the requirements put forward by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , seize the present favorable opportunities , integrate our solution of current predominant problems with our fulfillment of long-term development targets , and create favorable conditions for the cross-century development of state enterprises .  
Although the Chinese government insists that the Taiwan question brooks no intervention and has taken retaliatory action against European countries that sold advanced arms to Taiwan with satisfactory results , it is reluctant to take action to stop the United States from overtly calling for the maintenance of the status quo while covertly supporting " Taiwan independence , " because it is aware of its substantial gap with the United States in economic and military strength and has to take care of its economic development and improve the material life of its people .  
In their speeches , they stressed the need to unify thinking with central strategic policy decisions and to be more aware of politics , the overall situation , and responsibility .  In line with the unified arrangement of the party Central Committee and the State Council , we should conscientiously make plans , work in a down-to-earth manner , avoid practicing formalism , and realistically do a good job of guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativeness of the broad masses of the cadres and the people .  
In Anhui Province , Jilin Province , and Zhengzhou City , information providers were appointed among people in various social circles so that the departments concerned could be aware of the opinions and comments from the masses in good time , and could take more relevant actions to strengthen and improve the supervision over leading cadres and over the work of selecting and appointing cadres .  All this has won favorable comments form the masses and the cadres .  
Wang noted that the UN should make more positive contributions to preventing massive humanitarian crises and the tragic mass killings of innocent civilians .  At the same time , it should be fully aware of the complexity of international intervention and the risk of inappropriate intervention .  
In recent years , the United States has become more and more aware of the challenge brought by the sudden rise of China and regarded this as " one of the greatest challenges in making foreign policies for the 21st century . "  Any view that ignores or neglects China 's role is shortsighted and harmful .  In particular , after the Asian financial crisis , the United States has noted that China 's big power image is moving in a " positive direction , " and that China is a responsible power that can be cooperated with .  
However , Tien Hung-mao was unwilling to reconfirm Li Hsien-jen 's statements .  He stressed : Li Hsien-jen , as a convenor of the Foreign Affairs Committee , should be aware of the contents of such highly sensitive political statements .  Deputy Minister David Ta Wei Lee [ Li Ta-wei ] also pointed out on 18 December : Previously , because of their status in the opposition party , Bush 's personal aides who make decisions on foreign policies had opportunities to visit Taiwan and held talks with our government officials .  
High-level KMT officials were aware but fairly unconcerned about the likelihood of Liu Tai-ying and others deciding not to renew their party membership .  An unnamed high-level party official believes the popular will represented by Liu and others is limited .  
The CYL organizations at all levels should be fully aware that opposing " Falungong " is a long-term , intense , and complicated struggle , which is also , in essence , a serious political struggle ; should extensively mobilize or unite the broad masses of the CYL members or youth to wage a firm and thorough struggle against " Falungong , " which is an evil cult ; should play a role as a vital new force in a struggle aimed at exposing or repudiating " Falungong " as an evil cult ;  
People must be clearly aware of the sinister and malicious attempt of the evil cult .  Luo Haocai stressed : The horrifying suicide incident once again showed that our struggle against the " Falungong " evil cult is a round of serious political struggle , and we must fully realize that the struggle will last over a long time and is arduous and complicated .  While doing a good job in educating and transforming obsessed " Falungong " followers , it is also necessary to resolutely punish diehard members of the evil cult according to the laws .  
The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .

Between the ages of seven and 14 , there is a legal presumption that a child is incapable of committing a crime , but this can be rebutted by the prosecution on proof beyond reasonable doubt that , at the time of the offence , the child was well aware that his or her act was seriously wrong , and not merely naughty or mischievous . 
In an opening address , Director of FEHD Mrs Rita Lau said that although there was no scientific evidence so far to suggest that GM food was inherently harmful to human health , the Government was aware that there were different views held in the society on the subject and there was the demand for legislative control and labelling of GM food so as to enable consumers to make informed choice .  
( b ) In order to ensure that members of advisory and statutory bodies are aware of the functions of the relevant bodies as well as their duties , rights and responsibilities , we have issued guidelines requesting Bureaux and Departments to provide adequate information to the prospective appointees , prior to their appointment , to ensure that they have a clear understanding of their duties .  
" The incident has also given rise to wide discussion and concerns both within the Force and amongst the community .  Force management fully appreciates the concerns expressed .

All the views expressed will be carefully considered , " Mr Tsang said .  
The Board noted the current position of Hong Kong in the compilation of disability statistics .  Board members were aware that data on persons with disabilities were scattered in various administrative records maintained by different Government departments , statutory bodies and non-governmental organizations .  There was no single and comprehensive data source that could provide a complete picture on the demographic and socio-economic profiles of such persons .  
When we were aware that the demand growth was dropping , we have already started immediately to liaise with the Guangdong side to reduce the supply quantities .  After extensive negotiations , the Guangdong side has agreed in 1998 that the annual increase in supply quantities from 1998 to 2004 could be reduced by 20 million cubic metres ( mcm ) .  As a result , the total supply quantities in these seven years would be reduced by 560 mcm cumulatively .  
" With the promotion of various precautionary measures against AP by the Department of Health over the past few weeks , we believe that members of the public are all on high alert to guard against the disease .

Financial Secretary : We noted that the rating agency had adjusted the outlook of Hong Kong . The Government is fully aware of the impact of the atypical pneumonia on Hong Kong and on our economy .  That 's why the Government has assigned top priority in controlling and containing the spread of the disease .  And we spare no efforts , including financial , personnel and other resources , in making sure that the disease is controlled .  
Even after mounting the more than seventy steps to arrive at the cottage , the callers must be prepared for another climb . For , inside the cottage , the floor is laid more or less in line with the natural incline of the hill side . Callers may be surprised at the sloping floor , but as for me , familiarity breeds callousness - - I am now scarcely aware of the fact . Going from my study to the dining room is up-hill work .  
Earlier this century people became aware that if things continued in this way they could end up having a hard time even breathing . They came up with the idea of making polluters pay for the cost of the pollution they were responsible for . With that idea , a struggle over environmental rights , like the earlier one over human rights , became inevitable .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Our middle class is constantly expanding , and these people have an excellent educational level and potential as opinion-formers . Once they become aware of the importance of regenerating spiritual values in our civilization , I believe balanced social development will be within our grasp .  
They need more care : Of course , these children would n't need extra guidance if they did n't have problems . Every teacher is aware that very few children are able to make decisions of their own about their course in life . Assailed from every direction - - their natural talents , family environment , educational level , social status and so forth - - children who did n't have a very firm grasp on the tiller to begin with may easily wind up shaken and at a loss . "  
With incessant questioning , when your feeling of doubt is continuous so you are aware when acting , sitting , waking and sleeping , then you are working in the right way , can smash the ring of doubt and perceive the Truth .  
Had enough of silly love songsQ : You also have criticized the rampancy of love songs among pop music as revealing the misguided obsession of modern people with sentiment . Correspondingly , you encourage-ore social ly aware and critical music .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
Chen was Lai Ho 's companion in literature , and the two developed a close bond . They often interacted through poems and songs . The two of them joined together with a group of highly educated and politically aware writers to form the ' Ying Society . ' They composed poetry to express their concerns about current events and their sympathy with the lives of the masses , and they also used this to carry on the Chinese cultural tradition .  
Ho Jin-tsair , the director of the Department of Social Education in the Ministry of Education , says that the relevant government agencies have been under intense pressure since the discovery of the sunken ship off Penghu . Public opinion is inclined to see such wrecks as cultural resources . Many critics say that the MoE is not doing its job because , though it is aware that " national treasures " fall clearly within its purview , it is not actively moving to " rescue " the artifacts .  
The other teachers are all waiting for us to make fools of ourselves . They say we have absolutely no chance of success . " April Ten Alliance convener Chang Tze-chou has lent a hand solving the problem of " experimental class students being too noisy and getting out of control during class , " in response to the invitation of a teacher at a middle school experimenting with new policies . As a result , he is also deeply aware the troubles NGOs face in challenging the prevailing system .  
But Teng Shu-ping is also painfully aware that many of these jade artifacts have been illegally dug up and sold in mainland China , and not excavated by expert archaeologists . Such practices not only damage the ancient tombs , they also cause a great deal of archeological information to be lost . Furthermore , the spiralling price of fine ancient jade has indirectly encouraged counterfeiters , so that there are many bogus pieces about .  
Afterwards , she became aware of the unsettled , disorderly atmosphere in her home , and realized that it might be affecting the other two children . She was worried that they did not know how to deal with a severely handicapped little brother , and that this would create difficulties in their interpersonal relationships . She therefore had them take part in a psychological treatment group designed especially for children .  
It 's like getting addicted to coffee . Sure , the shows are n't very enlightening , and the kids are aware the shows are n't any good , but their emotions need a release . Sometimes they feel that the discussion today was really satisfying . " She does n't believe that topics should be taboo , but she does acknowledge that some hosts seem to be " walking on the edge , and if they go a few steps farther they 'll be illegal . "  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .  
People have long been aware of the educational and recreational functions of museums . But now the global trend is toward moving the focus of museums away from the elite to the general public , and relating them more closely to the lives of the people who live nearby . From elite to mass  
Shih Ying does not deny that there were already a number of community organizations active in Wenshan District , and that it already had quite a strong cultural and educational ethos . Thus siting the first community college there " in fact was a soft option-but that does n't mean we are n't aware of the difficulties to be faced later . " He says that in the future it is hoped that community colleges will spread to communities throughout Taiwan , but this will depend on each community 's degree of readiness and preparedness .  
The story of the Sun brothers surviving in the collapsed Tunghsing building in Taipei City thanks to a big old refrigerator was widely reported , but few people are aware that in the stricken areas many of the dead were crushed by falling heavy furniture and electrical appliances , or were trapped by overturned furniture which blocked their escape routes .  
With a tone of deep reflection , Mulroney affirms , " Because of him , we 've come to see a beautiful home that we never noticed before , and we 've become aware that it will easily be destroyed if we are n't careful , just like in Nebraska , where tens of thousands of buffalo trod the plains as far as the eye could see , and the native Americans lived by following the buffalo herds that spread out like a sea between the earth and sky .  
Some people criticize Hanfu literature for being overly descriptive , and for using too much esoteric vocabulary , thus weakening its artistic capability to touch people 's emotions . It became increasingly verbose and pedantic , and packed with pretentious and irrelevant terminology . With regard to this , Ko Ching-ming says that in fact Han literati were very much aware of what they were doing .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it .

I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
Few people are aware that in many Chinese restaurants overseas , almost every item of decor , from the paneled ceilings and intricately carved wooden ornamental windows to the floral-medallion-pattern carpet and the lions outside the door , is the work of Taiwan 's China Palace Art and Painting Company , owned and managed by the Sung family , and that most of these items were handmade in Taiwan before being shipped out by the container load .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
He became aware of how vastly different the Buddhist carvings in the Yungang Grottoes were to ancient Greek sculptures : the East emphasized tranquillity , capturing the essence , whereas the West stressed unrestrained energy and realistic depiction . Western figurative art considered the human body as a geometric form , an approach which culminated in the cubism of Picasso , whereas the Wei and Jin carvings of the Buddha give the human figure a sense of life and their forms embody and evoke a sense of more of life 's elements .  
Then , in the 1930s , Bell Laboratories in the US detected radio waves coming from the Milky Way galaxy , and researchers became aware that there are many signals in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye . Some of these electromagnetic waves can pass through dust clouds that block visible light , and can thereby reveal many unknown celestial worlds .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather .

Wang Hao-wei says that everyone is aware that heavy drinking will lead to serious problems . But fewer people are aware that the opposite extreme , not drinking at all , is also not synonymous with good health . This is because " some people are very tense , and people who never drink at all perhaps find it hard to relax . "  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice . While people should make as serious a commitment to marriage as they do to a career , as in a career one can change course or start again . When a marriage really can not be xxxxsustained , divorce should be a socially acceptable alternative , and does not symbolize personal failure or moral bankruptcy .  
Another international organization based in Taiwan that is devoted to eliminating poverty and hunger is the Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region ( FFTC ) , which was set up even earlier than the AVDRC . But because FFTC 's main mission is to collect and disseminate information on agricultural technology , it has a smaller staff than the AVDRC and does not have its own experimental farm or research personnel . Hence even fewer people outside the field of agriculture are aware of its existence .  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .  
However , Professor Kim was well aware of Hsiao 's romantic temperament and tender nature ; his works have always abounded with vivid color and layer upon layer of beautiful , unforgettable melody . As a result , Kim reminded Hsiao that he need n't be a slave to modern music and its jarring dissonances , encouraging him instead to follow his own musical path .  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
Such plans all emphasize lively and vivid presentation , and putting fun into learning . But the school authorities are also very aware that some parents might think the teachers are " not doing their regular work " or just playing games with the students . For this reason they must first persuade parents to support the approach . Fortunately , the experimental plan is aimed at first-grade students who entered junior high school in 2002 and who do n't yet feel the pressures of academic testing , so resistance is minimal .  
Lee Yuh-hwa , Eslite 's assistant manager of public relations , has been with Eslite for many years and seen its growth at first hand .

We feel political and economical closeness to the West , and we are aware of the unique historical opportunity to join the prosperous union of democratic European countries .  
We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
We are increasingly becoming aware that the world is one family , and that if we are to assure a brighter and better future for coming generations , we have no other choice than to continue our efforts towards preserving and promoting a strong United Nations that will be able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity , justice and shared economic progress .

In Anhui Province , Jilin Province , and Zhengzhou City , information providers were appointed among people in various social circles so that the departments concerned could be aware of the opinions and comments from the masses in good time , and could take more relevant actions to strengthen and improve the supervision over leading cadres and over the work of selecting and appointing cadres .

A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .
