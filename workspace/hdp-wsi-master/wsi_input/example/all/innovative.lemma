Chinese scientists ' research on human genome has been fully supported by the State 's Program 869 and Program 973 , Natural Science Foundation and others .  On April 21 , the relevant person in charge at the State Natural Science Foundation said in an interview that opening the human gene database to the public free of charge can allow ordinary people access to the cutting-edge science .  The person in charge said the more the public get to know about the innovative science , the more motivated scientists will feel for research .  
Hard supply refers to the low-level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form .

It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
From a managerial point of view , we must strive to build an open , vivid , dynamic , and relaxed competitive research environment ; enable innovative tasks to receive timely and relevant support , and also allow them to be carried out smoothly .  
The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .

We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .

An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
Achieving technological dynamism is therefore a major objective and challenge facing all countries .  To this end , parallel to individual country efforts , inter-country or cross-country initiatives are taking shape in the interest of efficiency and dynamic complementarities that achieve economies of scale and broaden the scope of innovative activities , particularly where the critical level of resources is not readily available .
