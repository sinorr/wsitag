When the first volume of Science and Civilisation in China was published in 1954 , Needham 's humanistic aspirations were still confronted by two established bodies of opinion .

The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years .

In terms of land management , besides continuing the " royal demesne " system , the " garrison field system " was adopted . Under this system , in ordinary times soldiers would farm the land and be self-sufficient .

Chang Chin-un , a designer and consultant for several large hospitals and president of the Hospital Association of the Republic of China , points out a direction which is concrete . Group-practice clinics should be established to draw in patients with a stronger line-up of physicians and advanced equipment , as well as striking up a cooperative relationship with large hospitals , further strengthening a bi lateral referral system . He also suggests establishing " half-open system hospitals , " along the American model , which specialize in offering equipment and locales for use by licensed physicians .

"  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
Because Kaohsiung harbor has a huge capacity , and is a pivotal spot for routes to southeast Asia , in the Japanese occupation era the authorities made it a concentration point for heavy industry and petroleum refining .

Wu Yii-feng emphasizes that the most unique characteristic of a documentary film is the relationship established between the film maker and the subject .

Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them .

It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention . 
The current period has been particularly important for this new international organization : the principal organs of the Authority - the Assembly , the 36-member Council and the Secretariat - have all been established , together with the subsidiary expert bodies , and the organizational work required to assume the substantive functions entrusted to the Authority by Part XI of the Convention and by the 1994 Agreement has been initiated .  
The group of experts on marine and coastal biodiversity , established pursuant to decision II / 10 of the Second Conference of Parties , has not been able to meet as planned ; however , the first step has been achieved in drawing up a roster of nominated experts from which the group will be composed .  
The European Union believed that the medium-term plan should reflect the political parameters established at the recent global conferences , promote their integrated implementation and assess the organizational needs , including the administrative and budgetary resources required to facilitate the implementation of the commitments undertaken .

Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
The fierce international competition and the ever growing ability of well established firms to penetrate remote and underdeveloped markets makes it increasingly difficult for enterprises in low-income countries , in particular the LDCs , to survive , let alone compete , unless strong supportive action is taken so as to redress the structural handicaps confronted by these firms .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
Each national legislation established its own rules concerning natural persons , with the sole obligation of observing international custom and generally recognized legal principles , particularly the 1993 Hague Convention concerning specific questions relating to conflicts of laws on nationality .  
The measures imposed on the Bosnian Serb party were suspended indefinitely starting on 27 February 1996 , after the Security Council was informed the day before , through the appropriate political authorities , that , in the assessment of the commander of the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation established in the Peace Agreement ( letters to States and international organizations , SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2 ) and SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2-1 ) ) ;  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,

Gratis personnel have also been accepted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services ; their functions have included auditing and ensuring compliance with recommendations of the Office ; their contractual relationship to the United Nations is established by a special service agreement ; since support costs have not been charged to the donor Governments , those costs have fallen upon the regular budget .  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .

JIU shared the view of the Administrative Tribunal that the language of Article 101.3 unequivocally established a standard under which less qualified persons were not entitled to preferential treatment based on gender , and that the fundamental principle reflected in that Article might not be diluted by a desire to overcome past problems .  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
Yemen reaffirms the need to move quickly towards a final settlement of the question of Palestine that will allow the Palestinian people to attain their legitimate rights , especially their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital , in keeping with international law and with the fundamental principles established at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo and subsequent agreements .

Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .

While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .

The first one is that , by having established and implemented the largest compensation operation in history in record time and at minimum cost , the international community , acting through the United Nations , has confirmed the potential and capacity of the world organization to meet new and unprecedented challenges and to do it better than such operations performed outside its scope .  
In a recently completed study carried out by UNCHS in Africa and Asia , direct epidemiological relationships between inadequate waste management and the incidence of diarrhoea and , respiratory and skin diseases have been established and low-cost , remedial interventions have been recommended , advancing strong health arguments for targeted investments in infrastructure in low-income settlements .

They also try to ensure that the guidelines include the main criteria to be fulfilled by NGOs applying for consultative status , such as being of a representative character and having a recognized standing , as well as having an established record in areas falling within the competence of a given agency .  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .

The Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the Commission and the Sub-Commission to the incompatibility with international law and with the concurrent criteria established by it of some legislations _ generally inspired by common law and based on national security _ that authorize the adoption of exceptional measures ( such as prolonged administrative detentions , severe restrictions of freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate , and which lay down severe penalties for any breach of them ) without the need to proclaim a state of emergency .  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .

After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , as established at the Managua meeting , is an ambitious and comprehensive initiative guided by the principles of respect for life ; peace ; democracy ; the observance of human rights ; economic integration ; and the responsibility of succeeding generations for sustainable development ( A / 49 / 580-S / 1994 / 1217 , annex I ) .

To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
The safeguarding of peace and the promotion of closer and sustained cooperation among Mediterranean countries should enable the enjoyment of complete sovereignty by all the peoples of the region , free and protected by established and accepted territorial borders and adhering to a mutual policy of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of each other .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
Although , in practice , compulsory education in the national system of education consists of primary education and basic middle education ( basic secondary ) , its compulsory nature has not been established expressly by law , since the Act promulgated in 1959 ( No . 680 / 59 ) provided for compulsory education up to 12 years of age and the sixth grade of primary schooling , and its provisions have not been modified since .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .

At its organizational session , the Commission decided to include three substantive items on its 1997 agenda : item 4 Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; item 5 Fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ; and item 6 Guidelines on conventional arms control / limitation and disarmament , with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 N . Three Working Groups were established to deal with these agenda items . 
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
Expected results and successful criteria include : ( a ) functional gender-development units will have been established in each of the 27 countries participating in the regional programme ; ( b ) databases on national and regional gender-in-development activities will have been set up ; ( c ) networks will have been established between non-governmental organizations and gender-in-development units ; and ( d ) institutions involved in gender-related research and training will have been provided with results that may have an impact on national gender-related issues .  
To the supplementary Ariane-5 programmes at rates ranging from 3 to 6 per cent according to the anticipated activities in these three programmes , with the aim of maintaining the high standard of the specific industrial capabilities established in Belgium since the 1970s and thus preserving their advantageous position in the industrial consortium marketing the launch vehicle .  
For example , the parties involved in the projects conducted geological studies and a national inventory of natural resources in Madagascar , established a forest inventory in Tunisia , created an agricultural land information system in Egypt and an action plan for flood control in Bangladesh , controlled resettlement of refugees in Cambodia , and prepared a demographic census in Nigeria , a dam site impact study in Cameroon , erosion studies in Chile and a cartographic survey of mine dumps in South Africa .  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
An average of 96 groundsmen and cleaners were employed under special service agreements to clean a maximum of 88 military locations at a monthly payment equivalent to the lowest grade provided for in the established local salary scales ( $ 915 per month ) .  
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing , a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , the sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
Even with the passing years , we can not forget how the international community erred in addressing this crisis by involuntarily encouraging those who , over the course of time , felt increasingly comfortable in giving free rein to their ethnocentric and inhumane aspirations , coldly established as systematic theory .  
These documents have established a legal order governing the ocean space which will contribute to the exploration of the sea for peaceful purposes and the equitable and efficient utilization of marine resources and facilitate the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order .

We are confident that the Secretary-General will ensure the continuing institutional capacity of the Organization to respond adequately to the needs of States , newly established institutions and other competent international organizations by providing advice and assistance , taking into account the special needs of developing countries .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .

An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
At the theoretical level , the Conference scientifically established the organic interrelationship between the natural state of mountains and climatic conditions arising in mountainous areas , on the one hand , and the disruption of the ecological balance and level of social and economic development of peoples living in mountainous areas , on the other .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
It is recommended that the reporting procedures of funds and programmes follow similar lines as those established for the Office of Internal Oversight Services in paragraph 5 ( e ) of resolution 48 / 218 B . Therefore , internal oversight units should be authorized to submit , through their respective executive heads , periodic comprehensive reports and ad hoc reports on specific issues to their governing bodies .  
At its fifty _ second session the Commission on Human Rights decided , without a vote , that all continuing thematic or country _ oriented mandates established by the Commission and entrusted to special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups are expected to report to the fifty _ third session ( decision 1996 / 113 ) .  
Although the Commission was not yet fully functional at the time of the mission of the Special Rapporteur , standing committees had been established on relations with non _ governmental and community _ based organizations , and international and parliamentary liaison , on legal and constitutional matters , and on policy and planning matters , including those relating to women 's human rights .  
First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;

That strategy was already yielding results : between 1992 and 1996 , per capita income had risen substantially , while rural poverty had declined ; direct elections to new village committees had been held in the majority of municipalities , provinces and autonomous regions and the revised criminal code had established , inter alia , the principle of equality before the law .  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
The increasing number of the fabricated and unjustified blocks and holds it puts on and the objections it makes to many of the contracts submitted to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , particularly in recent times , have demonstrated that the United States administration is using that Committee as a tool to implement its irresponsible policy directed against Iraq , by , whenever it wishes , preventing the Committee from approving contracts for food and medical supplies .  
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .

Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .

Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
I should like to call your attention to the fact that , during the initial 180-day period the Memorandum of Understanding has been in effect , the representative of the United States of America in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) has deliberately obstructed and delayed the processing of contracts in the Committee for odious political reasons inimical to the people of Iraq .  
We are particularly happy to note that an excellent cooperation based on full mutual understanding has been established between the command of MPF , the Albanian authorities and the Albanian public , in general , which constitutes a solid basis for success in helping to alleviate and resolve the crisis . 
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
In addition , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47 / 180 , they had prepared national reports , established national committees with broad-based participation and made specific proposals and firm commitments regarding housing and human settlements at the national and international levels .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
IASC has agreed that simple field-based monitoring systems should be established in all complex emergency situations in which the United Nations system is involved in order to facilitate accountability , to optimize utilization of resources , to avoid duplication of effort and to adapt to changing circumstances .  The establishment of the system will be an inter _ agency effort carried out under the leadership of the resident / humanitarian coordinator .  
Urges the developed countries , in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity , taking into account established official development assistance targets and their current level of contribution , to increase substantially their official development assistance , including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system and for the effective implementation of the outcomes of the major United Nations international conferences ;  
Ms .

The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .  
You have no doubt noted that , even after the submission of your report to the Security Council of 2 June 1997 ( S / 1997 / 419 ) , two of the members of the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , namely the United States and the United Kingdom , are continuing to raise numerous difficulties and obstacles to the proper implementation of the provisions of the memorandum of understanding by impeding the approval of contract applications for the purchase of food , medicines and other basic humanitarian requirements .

The waves stirred up when the ROC established formal ties with the Marshall Islands and Macedonia are but one example of the ROC 's and PRC 's diplomatic wrangling . Yet they illustrate clearly the ROC 's current situation in regard to its allies .

Even before the museum was established , there was a ready-made stream of visitors passing through the area looking for worthwhile places to go .  
" Crab doctor " Wu Shu-he , who is cooperating with the museum on a research project , explains why its specimens have attracted so much attention . In the three to four centuries since natural history museums were first established , there were no significant advances in the preparation of crustacean specimens .

Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention . 
The current period has been particularly important for this new international organization : the principal organs of the Authority - the Assembly , the 36-member Council and the Secretariat - have all been established , together with the subsidiary expert bodies , and the organizational work required to assume the substantive functions entrusted to the Authority by Part XI of the Convention and by the 1994 Agreement has been initiated .

Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
The fierce international competition and the ever growing ability of well established firms to penetrate remote and underdeveloped markets makes it increasingly difficult for enterprises in low-income countries , in particular the LDCs , to survive , let alone compete , unless strong supportive action is taken so as to redress the structural handicaps confronted by these firms .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
Each national legislation established its own rules concerning natural persons , with the sole obligation of observing international custom and generally recognized legal principles , particularly the 1993 Hague Convention concerning specific questions relating to conflicts of laws on nationality .  
The measures imposed on the Bosnian Serb party were suspended indefinitely starting on 27 February 1996 , after the Security Council was informed the day before , through the appropriate political authorities , that , in the assessment of the commander of the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bosnian Serb forces had withdrawn from the zones of separation established in the Peace Agreement ( letters to States and international organizations , SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2 ) and SCA / 8 / 96 ( 2-1 ) ) ;

Gratis personnel have also been accepted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services ; their functions have included auditing and ensuring compliance with recommendations of the Office ; their contractual relationship to the United Nations is established by a special service agreement ; since support costs have not been charged to the donor Governments , those costs have fallen upon the regular budget .  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .

Thus , if a part of the population of a particular country wanted to change their status , there were three contexts in which this could be achieved : when the constitution established a right to self-determination ; when all the parties concerned agreed to secession ; and when that part of the population was denied the right to participate freely in the conduct of public affairs or if their civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights were denied .

The first one is that , by having established and implemented the largest compensation operation in history in record time and at minimum cost , the international community , acting through the United Nations , has confirmed the potential and capacity of the world organization to meet new and unprecedented challenges and to do it better than such operations performed outside its scope .  
In a recently completed study carried out by UNCHS in Africa and Asia , direct epidemiological relationships between inadequate waste management and the incidence of diarrhoea and , respiratory and skin diseases have been established and low-cost , remedial interventions have been recommended , advancing strong health arguments for targeted investments in infrastructure in low-income settlements .

They also try to ensure that the guidelines include the main criteria to be fulfilled by NGOs applying for consultative status , such as being of a representative character and having a recognized standing , as well as having an established record in areas falling within the competence of a given agency .  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .

The Special Rapporteur has drawn the attention of the Commission and the Sub-Commission to the incompatibility with international law and with the concurrent criteria established by it of some legislations _ generally inspired by common law and based on national security _ that authorize the adoption of exceptional measures ( such as prolonged administrative detentions , severe restrictions of freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate , and which lay down severe penalties for any breach of them ) without the need to proclaim a state of emergency .  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .

With its leaner and more focused mandate , the Mission will undergo a corresponding reduction of its personnel and will thus complete its transformation from the large peacekeeping operation established in 1995 , with a strength of approximately 6,000 military and 700 civilian police personnel , to a contingent of 250 civilian police and a headquarters unit of 50 military personnel having full command and control over a voluntarily funded security element .  
Likewise , the categorized list contains certain items the export of which to Iraq must be notified to the joint unit established by Security Council resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) as these items will be subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian or for prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant resolutions .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .

Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
We request you to intervene with the Government of the United States with a view to halting these provocative actions and the obstacles being raised to the implementation of the memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the United Nations , and in order to ensure that the articles approved by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are delivered and that such actions are not repeated , as they constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the precepts of international law .

To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping .

Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
Although , in practice , compulsory education in the national system of education consists of primary education and basic middle education ( basic secondary ) , its compulsory nature has not been established expressly by law , since the Act promulgated in 1959 ( No . 680 / 59 ) provided for compulsory education up to 12 years of age and the sixth grade of primary schooling , and its provisions have not been modified since .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .

Success will be measured by the number of additional jobs and improved livelihoods generated by new investments , increased trade and development of infrastructure , and the cooperative mechanisms established and strengthened to ensure sustainability and promote peaceful and productive development among the member States .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
Expected results and successful criteria include : ( a ) functional gender-development units will have been established in each of the 27 countries participating in the regional programme ; ( b ) databases on national and regional gender-in-development activities will have been set up ; ( c ) networks will have been established between non-governmental organizations and gender-in-development units ; and ( d ) institutions involved in gender-related research and training will have been provided with results that may have an impact on national gender-related issues .

The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
During the discussion , it was stated that machinery should be established that does not require diplomatic action , that sufficient publicity should be given to existing means of defence and that closed investigations should be made public or open so that they will be more effective .  
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Recognizing that a special session should set the future course of action in the field of disarmament and related security matters , emphasizing the importance of multilateralism in the process of disarmament , bearing in mind the historical significance of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the first special session devoted to disarmament , and the need to strengthen the machinery established by this session , as well as existing multilateral bodies and regimes , the objectives of the special session could include , inter alia :  
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .

With the decreased level of construction of subsidized public housing , a Welfare Builders ' Programme has been established by the Ministry of Welfare , which offers acceptable alternatives to poor young families to obtain their first home , as well as to the handicapped , the sick and persons who were formerly in the care of the State and their families .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
These disturbing trends are in contrast with the global consensus that has emerged during major international conferences organized over the past decade under the auspices of the United Nations . They raise legitimate questions as to the very future of the system established to organize international cooperation for development .  
In the context of these changes , and more than half a century after the United Nations was established , there is an urgent need for the Organization to undergo drastic reforms , both structural and functional , so as to establish rules and principles for a new international order free of double standards .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .

In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .

Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .

A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
At the theoretical level , the Conference scientifically established the organic interrelationship between the natural state of mountains and climatic conditions arising in mountainous areas , on the one hand , and the disruption of the ecological balance and level of social and economic development of peoples living in mountainous areas , on the other .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
It is recommended that the reporting procedures of funds and programmes follow similar lines as those established for the Office of Internal Oversight Services in paragraph 5 ( e ) of resolution 48 / 218 B .

First , effective horizontal lines of communication between the existing internal oversight functions should be established in every agency and vertical lines of reporting to the executive management level should be clearly defined and shortened .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;

As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Accordingly , we concur with the Secretary-General 's recommendation to extend the mandate of UNAVEM III until 30 June 1997 , on the understanding that the operation would gradually proceed with the transition towards a United Nations observer mission in Angola to be formally established on 1 July 1997 .  In addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , the observer mission would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at consolidating the national reconciliation process .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
The increasing number of the fabricated and unjustified blocks and holds it puts on and the objections it makes to many of the contracts submitted to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , particularly in recent times , have demonstrated that the United States administration is using that Committee as a tool to implement its irresponsible policy directed against Iraq , by , whenever it wishes , preventing the Committee from approving contracts for food and medical supplies .  
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .

Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .

Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
I should like to call your attention to the fact that , during the initial 180-day period the Memorandum of Understanding has been in effect , the representative of the United States of America in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) has deliberately obstructed and delayed the processing of contracts in the Committee for odious political reasons inimical to the people of Iraq .  
We are particularly happy to note that an excellent cooperation based on full mutual understanding has been established between the command of MPF , the Albanian authorities and the Albanian public , in general , which constitutes a solid basis for success in helping to alleviate and resolve the crisis . 
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
In addition , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47 / 180 , they had prepared national reports , established national committees with broad-based participation and made specific proposals and firm commitments regarding housing and human settlements at the national and international levels .  
To this end , we recommit ourselves to the global partnership established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and to the continuous dialogue and action inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and equitable world economy , as a means to provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .
