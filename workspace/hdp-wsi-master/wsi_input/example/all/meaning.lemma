Official polls in Taiwan chimed in with these views with ulterior motives and deliberately distorted the meaning of " one country , two systems . "  They deceived and threatened the Taiwan public by calling the realization of China 's national reunification a move to " make Taiwan accept mainland rule , " and describing " China 's special administrative region " as " a special administrative region of Communist China .

Back then , Japan 's expression of reservations about the United States ' stern policies amid its own censure of China along with the Bush administration 's own hesitation and doubts that soon attracted much attention no doubt convinced Deng Xiaoping , a great strategist who deeply understood the meaning of " realpolitik , " that ideological consensus would not obstruct or stop the growing conflict between Japan and the United States nor would the ideological differences eliminate the possibility of those two countries ' respective long-term cooperative coexistence with China .

"

15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .

Take water sleeves for example ; the extent of expression that can be conveyed by an actor 's hand movement is limited .

Undergoing radiation and chemotherapy , she finds her moods turning gloomy . From reading the classics , she discovered that the Chinese character for cancer ( ) has no particular etymology of meaning but rather is just a frightening pictograph .

The characters on the oracle bones , which are of the six orthodox varieties of " ideographic , pictographic , compound ideographic , attered phonetic , combined meaning / phonetic , and phonetic loan " characters , must have already been at an early stage of standardization , and could not have been the earliest Chinese writing .

" The lone eagle circles over the sparse wood , searching for a meaning in life .

"  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
In Chinese medicine , jing ( meaning both " semen " and " vital essence " ) , yuan ( " innate vital energy " ) , qi ( " breath " and " vital energy " ) and shen ( " spirit " ) are known as the " four treasures .

An even more noteworthy feature of their culture is that they typically buried the dead sideways with knees bent , and the burial site was not far from their homes , meaning that even when Ketagalans passed away , they were not forsaken by their relatives or society . They still received attention and remained in their loved ones ' memory . This is somewhat similar to what we know from oral history of the funerary customs of other indigenous people .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction .

The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation .

He pointed out that the new leader of the Taiwan authorities adopted an evasive style toward the One China principle in his " inaugural speech " , and lacked this most fundamental point ; all the other pleasant sounding sweet words and blandishments , and the so-called expressions of goodwill , all became scraps of worthless paper , carrying no meaning .  
Dai Wenbin , a professor at China 's Taiwan Research Institute of the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences , believes that the " inaugural speech " of the new leader of the Taiwan authorities was actually advocating " peaceful Taiwan independence " .  Judging by appearances , he used beautiful and pleasant sounding words when speaking , which made it appear that he wanted to express a meaning of detente .  
The perspective given to people from the meaning within the words was not so much wanting to show good intentions , but hinging on the elaborate style of the wording , seemed to show the new official Taiwan leadership is lacking sufficient understanding of the serious situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . The cunning application of wording was greater than that allotted to practical considerations , and the elaborate portion was greater than the revealing of sincere feelings .  
Thus , the speech 's use of " Taiwan stands up " as a topic , the great and special discussion of " the beginning of a new age , " " overcoming fear , threats , and pressure , bravely standing up , " " symbolizing the pursuit of hope and the realization of dreams , " " seemingly standing before the threshold of an entirely new history , " and the final loud call for " Long live the Taiwan people , " perhaps all can not be explained from a simple literal meaning .  
Back then , Japan 's expression of reservations about the United States ' stern policies amid its own censure of China along with the Bush administration 's own hesitation and doubts that soon attracted much attention no doubt convinced Deng Xiaoping , a great strategist who deeply understood the meaning of " realpolitik , " that ideological consensus would not obstruct or stop the growing conflict between Japan and the United States nor would the ideological differences eliminate the possibility of those two countries ' respective long-term cooperative coexistence with China .

"  
When the talks were about to conclude , the SEF representative proposed three more forms of expression and also produced the content of their final expression : " Although in the course of the common efforts of both sides in pursuing national reunification , both sides uphold the one China principle , they have different understanding regarding the meaning of one China .  
American media started to call Clinton a " lame duck " before the curtain was raised on the election campaign in the first half of this year , meaning that as he was soon to leave office , domestic attention switched the new master of the White House who would replace him , while international opinion would gradually take an attitude of observation , so it would be hard to him to have much impact on domestic and foreign affairs in the future .  
At the same time as this , the new authorities ignored the requests of the widespread public in Taiwan for easing up , improvement and development of cross-strait relations , and ignored the urgent requests of numerous industrial and business circles to quicken cross-strait economic interchanges and cooperation .  They still obstinately insisted on Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] " no haste , be patient " policy , saying one thing about cross-strait direct " three links " and meaning another , completely lacking sincerity .  
Since opening and reform were implemented , China 's rural operating system has undergone fundamental changes , but administrative system reform has lagged behind , meaning it could not meet the demands of rural market economic development .

15 .  We must point out that legislative interpretation is not equivalent to amendment .  Legislative interpretation must be faithful to the true legislative intent .

Take water sleeves for example ; the extent of expression that can be conveyed by an actor 's hand movement is limited . After adding the sleeves , not only is the meaning of the opera deepened , but also it can make the graceful and tender figure more noticeable and give the viewer a strong and sharp sensation . If a sense of despair is to be expressed , then both sleeves are lifted high into the air at the same time .

Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University . When official astronomers witnessed an unusual celestial event , they would attach some forced political meaning to it , and rarely explored for the objective truth .  
" The Chinese critical tradition is a weighty burden that often proves stifling .

"  
To use wooden fish to temper one 's mind has a very symbolic meaning . The never-sleeping eyes tell us that Buddhist cultivation is limitless and that the cleansing process is endless .

Variety shows are well designed to create illusory effects through special lighting effects , snazzy camerawork and dubbing to videotapes . Once young pop fans are swept up in all this , why should they worry about its content and meaning ?  
Chang Hao has a penetrating analysis in that regard . Modernization theories , he points out , have their origin in the 18th-century Enlightenment . Their argument is simple : " modernization " - - meaning industrialization , capitalism , the rise of a middle class , democracy and freedom of thought - - is good and the sole criterion of value used to measure a country 's " progress . " And evidenced by the " backward " countries of the " non-Western world , " modernization and tradition are often antithetical .

In sketching flowers and birds , the Southern Sung painters gave up intricate lines of neat perfection in favor of bold and vigorous strokes and forsook rich colors in favor of more gentle pigments .

Undergoing radiation and chemotherapy , she finds her moods turning gloomy . From reading the classics , she discovered that the Chinese character for cancer ( ) has no particular etymology of meaning but rather is just a frightening pictograph .

It 's been nearly 100 years since the rediscovery of oracle bone writing , and there has always been one mystery . The characters on the oracle bones , which are of the six orthodox varieties of " ideographic , pictographic , compound ideographic , attered phonetic , combined meaning / phonetic , and phonetic loan " characters , must have already been at an early stage of standardization , and could not have been the earliest Chinese writing .

" The lone eagle circles over the sparse wood , searching for a meaning in life .  
The dig report from that time pointed out that there were two cultural levels at the site . The pottery discovered in the upper layer had writing , and brass implements had also been unearthed , so that layer seems to be from the Chou dynasty . But the lower layer was entirely from a stone tool culture . The black and light yellow pottery that was found was innovative in shape and of very high quality in technique , meaning that it must have been " an important stage in high antiquity . "

Also , Lisa 's grasp of the computer profession is so good that she can be very faithful and fluent , and she can translate concisely while maintaining the subtle innuendos and insinuating tones . " For example , she used a slang term in Taiwanese meaning " Is that real ? " to express the dubious veracity of an event . She described the end of a big computer exhibition as a " leftover meal . " Such succinct and incisive language causes readers to infuse their own imagination into the spaces of the text .

Yet except for the moslems of Arabia who found a spiritual meaning in their abnormal state and treated them as spiritually blessed , most societies have traditionally viewed them as the cursed , bodies deserted by their spirits , violators of sacred laws , or people possessed by the devil - - even incarnations of the devil himself . They have faced brutal punishments , such as death by burning .  
It may sound odd , but here it is : Although the Nien genealogy clearly states that they are descended from the Jurchen , as far as the people of the Nien Clan Village are concerned , being identified as the heirs of Ahguda seems only to have occasional symbolic meaning , with little substantive impact .  
The secret of what meaning Liu Bowen really intended his poem to convey went with him to his grave ; but many believers did go to Tienhoukung Temple in Lukang to ask how the temple oracle could have been so mistaken . The temple elders came out in person to make it clear that " this was probably just hearsay or even a hoax , we do n't think the divination was made according to the proper practice , so of course its credibility is doubtful . "  
When we chose the book labels as gifts , we simply thought they had an old-fashioned elegance and would be nice to collect . We never thought that the negative side of their content would lead to a misunderstanding . Because our paper-cut stories are mainly intended to be amusing and tell a story , many of them have a negative or ironic side to their meaning . This is true , for instance , of stories in recent issues such as " Both on the Losing End , " and " No Silver Buried Here . "  
In Chinese medicine , jing ( meaning both " semen " and " vital essence " ) , yuan ( " innate vital energy " ) , qi ( " breath " and " vital energy " ) and shen ( " spirit " ) are known as the " four treasures .

In order to accommodate the living habits of the village 's Saisiyat residents , Wu thought of incorporating the short spirit ceremony into the dance , and with that in mind in 1994 he specially attended the biannual ceremony at Sky Lake , where he taped the entire thing .

"  
But these days , other products which have the same symbolic meaning - - like turtle-shaped patterns constructed out of canned food or made from mushrooms or day lilies - - are widely popular ; some people even just use cash as a substitute .

Even if most of the descendants of the Ketagalan have forgotten their own identity , according to an investigation by Lin En-shean , a professor at National Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Ethnology , in the wake of the recent increasing social emphasis on " native soil , " meaning a new esteem for local Taiwanese culture , the atmosphere in society toward minority ethnic groups has evolved from prejudice and taboo to respect .  
An even more noteworthy feature of their culture is that they typically buried the dead sideways with knees bent , and the burial site was not far from their homes , meaning that even when Ketagalans passed away , they were not forsaken by their relatives or society . They still received attention and remained in their loved ones ' memory . This is somewhat similar to what we know from oral history of the funerary customs of other indigenous people .  
Lien Te-sen became famous for his work " MRT , " in which he rendered the character xing ( �� ) , meaning " motion , " in several disconnected pieces , and in the center drew the character gui ( �t ) , meaning " turtle , " in ancient seal script , thus mocking the progress of Taipei 's traffic and mass rapid transit system .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture .

Chiang Han-kuang believes that in actuality the main purpose for promoting EQ is to teach everyone to pay attention to emotional and psychological health , to understand individual personalities , to become more mature and stable and to maintain a balance between the body and the mind .

Another reason for the PRC 's low-key attitude is that the current model for direct shipping does not have the " domestic " shipping label which PRC officials regard as ideal , meaning that the flagging issue has not been completely resolved .

For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .

To Chen 's student Huang Li-shu lacquer ware has Zen-like meaning : " Lacquer ware is like the character of oriental people . When striking and bright colors are coated by transparent amber lacquer , they become muted . After being rubbed , lacquer 's sheen loses its glare to acquire a subdued beauty . When using a piece of lacquer ware , you catch a glimpse of your own reflection , and holding a piece of it in your hand is calming to the mind . "

But the distorted value systems on these other shows , in which truth becomes inseparable from fiction , are even more insidious . " Kuo says that most people already find it difficult to extract meaning from reality in all its complexity and suffer information overload . People usually take the easy way out , and turn to television . The uninterrupted flow of dubiously " re-constructed , " or outright fictional , information can temporarily offer solace to their tired souls .  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .

She was dumbfounded when he came back with the rubber suction cup for a plunger . Chinese who go to America all have difficulty with understanding slang expressions like " standing someone up , " or the meaning of " yield " in traffic signs , or that what they know as " hiding from the kitty " is called " peekaboo " in English and that when describing someone unattractive , it is better to say " plain " instead of " ugly .

In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .

It 's like a spiritual sauna . Or , like a pilgrimage to the great cities of the ancient world , for modern people this is a relaxing and enriching education . Unfortunately , construction of the Internet part of the Avatamsaka World is still ongoing .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
The e-Generation 's predilection for image-based reasoning is causing their patience for serious reading and logical writing to gradually erode . Their writing is incoherent and even in spoken language they show a tendency towards the abbreviated , partially formed language favored by commercials ; in the end , their actual meaning evaporates in a flash of fragmented information .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what .

The impression that people are still unable to grasp the meaning of installation art is naturally one of the first addressed by the author .

Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved .
