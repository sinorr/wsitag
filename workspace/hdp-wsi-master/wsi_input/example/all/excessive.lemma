In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .  
The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
The Council also expressed grave concern about the excessive level of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including the introduction of sophisticated weaponry .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
An appropriate balance must also be struck between including all the substantive and procedural norms necessary to ensure proper criminal procedure and the need to avoid an excessive level of detail which could impede the success of the initiative .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .

Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
Given the serious consequences of the problem as described above , this is a promising time to analyse the small arms and light weapons in use in recent conflicts , the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer , as well as to recommend to Member States , regional organizations and the international community as a whole , particularly as represented by the United Nations , practical measures to prevent and reduce the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of such weapons , with a view to diminishing their role in exacerbating conflicts .  
Attention should be drawn to the need to strike a balance between the interests of the various States so as to reduce the gap between the excessive well-being of some and the alarming poverty of others , since , in an increasingly interdependent world which shared a common destiny , solutions to environmental problems must be closely interrelated .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
Since the market and other informational failures that lay behind their taking on such excessive aggregate market exposures in East Asia were massive , the required regulatory changes would have to be far-reaching and the early warning systems elaborate .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .

The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
The conference , for this purpose , should consider the main factors leading and contributing to the excessive accumulation of small arms and may adopt a plan of action consisting of specific coordinated efforts by the international community to reduce and prevent illicit trafficking as well as to face and resolve the problems associated with the excessive accumulation of small arms .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
In conclusion , while the efforts of the Council to lend its voice to the efforts to halt the excessive accumulation of and traffic in small arms is laudable , we wish to caution that the underlying sociological , economic and political causes of conflict must be addressed so as to create conditions of stability and thus reduce the need for arms and , consequently , for conflict .  
If the parties raised preliminary objections for tactical rather than objective reasons , pleaded at excessive length and attached long annexes to their pleadings or called for unduly extended oral proceedings , the length of the proceedings would be drawn out .  
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .

While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the difficulties that the concerned Governments face in fighting armed insurgent groups , she notes with concern that in some countries Governments have adopted counter-insurgency strategies , often involving excessive and indiscriminate use of force , aimed at targeting those suspected of being members , collaborators or sympathizers of those groups , leading to further violations of the right to life .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
In some areas , the police make special raids on Roma communities - armed assaults in the early hours of the morning , during which houses are searched , the contents ransacked , inhabitants , including women , the elderly and children , harassed or subjected to excessive force , and men rounded up for arrest and questioning , usually without search and arrest warrants .

With regard to possible future work on insolvency law , his delegation agreed with the view that strong insolvency and debtor-creditor regimes were important for preventing or limiting financial crises and promoting rapid and orderly recovery from excessive indebtedness .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 122-125 ) , regulatory agencies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
Our national and regional security is best enhanced through the development of an international security system and through the removal of the threat to peace posed by weapons of mass destruction and the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
It is appropriate to recall today that , against the backdrop of an Israeli occupation that has continued for several decades , the Government of Ariel Sharon initiated a systematic policy of aggression against the Palestinian people , destroying their property , imposing economic blockades on their towns and villages and collective punishment through the repeated use of excessive and sustained force with all the weapons in the Israeli arsenal , and using force on a daily basis against unarmed Palestinian civilians .  
COHCHR has also received allegations of police violence and excessive use of force , summary and extrajudicial execution , disappearance , mob killings , torture , political intimidation and violence against members of political parties , in particular the opposition party , including instances of extrajudicial execution , interference of the executive in judicial matters , curtailment of the freedom of association and expression and intimidation of human rights defenders .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .

On the contrary , it has been observed that secured creditors generally require only that the insolvency regime be sufficiently fair and predictable to instil in them the belief that their security rights , if properly created , will ultimately be enforceable against the collateral within a reasonable time frame , without excessive cost and without being subject to unanticipated competing claims .  
The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed . 
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .

Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In addition to continuing with efforts to improve the well-being of the poor , IMF contributes to the monitoring of progress towards international development goals in three ways : disseminating information of growth rates in countries ; reporting the composition of government expenditures with a view to encouraging countries to reduce unproductive expenditures , such as excessive military expenditures ; and tracking trends in social expenditures and social indicators in low-income countries and transition economies .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
In Southern and East Africa , for example , the benefits from harmonized axle load limits are as follows : ( i ) transport operators are able to load their trucks with the maximum payload ; ( ii ) harmonized axle load limits facilitate uniform axle load enforcement ; ( iii ) these limits also facilitate exchange of information on overloading and on habitual violators of axle load limits ; and ( iv ) there is uniform application of fines for overloading and excessive gross vehicle weights , based on an agreed pavement damage formula .  
Israels possession of excessive quantities of weapons , its stupendous arsenal of highly destructive and unconventional weapons and its categorical refusal to place its nuclear installations under International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards constitute a flagrant challenge to the international community .  
Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures , especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic development in many regions , particularly in post-conflict situations ,  
Continuing to promote and enhance effective measures , including fiscal and financial sector reforms for better domestic resource mobilization , and reallocating public resources for investment in social development , inter alia through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures ;

There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
Second , we will combine the SOE reform with structural adjustment , vigorously develop new high-tech industries represented by the information technologies , quicken the pace of transforming the traditional industries with new high technologies and advanced applied technologies , push forward industrialization through the application of information technologies on an extensive scale , and continue to eliminate the backward and excessive production capacity that are not suited to market demands .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
Such a judgment that sets academic backgrounds and knowledge against practice is a mentality of finding fault with and making excessive demands on high-quality talent ; and in the eyes of people with such a mentality , high-quality talent " are not bold and vigorous enough in their work but are holding themselves aloof , " lack mature skills in leading the troops , have insufficient drive in exercising control , and are engaged in impractical scientific research and studies .  
Although technology objectively has a negative impact on the environment , this negative viewpoint is basically a flimsy excuse .  With the economic development and the people 's understanding being raised to a higher and higher level , the people will make a higher and higher demand for a quality life and a healthy , comfortable environment .  This will basically restrict the living space of the technology featuring excessive exploitation of natural resources and will help promote the development of environmentally friendly technology .  
Many administrative and management personnel have also become fairly accustomed to the set of management methods of the planned economy .  The phenomenon of lacking a market economic management concept and management skills , and the lack of positions , excessive positions , and mistaken positions , still exists in large degree .  
We must take effective measures to appropriately lower the prices of industrial raw materials for which there are big price differences between China and abroad , resolutely intensify the work of closing down " five small " industries and knocking out backward production capacity , ensure the prevention of new duplicate construction , strictly control excessive imports of ordinary industrial products , and expand the market space for the development of state enterprises .  
They have made positive contributions to controlling excessive population growth , improving population quality , and bringing population growth into line with economic , social , resource , and environmental development .  
Such circumstances have already emerged in some localities .  Take the northern region which has relied upon drilling water to irrigate cultivated land for a long time as an example : Owing to the excessive pumping of underground water , the underground water level in this region has fallen rapidly , causing strata to subside in varying degrees .  In north China and other regions , the excessive extraction of underground water has led to underground funnels and surface subsidence and has entailed rather serious consequences .  
Recently , to attain excessive profits , foreign organizers for illegal emigration continually manipulated the masses ' eagerness to get rich , changed their tactics , and plotted and organized illegal emigration .

However , taking into consideration the negative impact of the expansionary financial policy , there is a need to adjust the focus of the macropolicy in a timely manner and correspondingly weaken the " primary " impetus , to prevent the excessive accumulation of negative effects resulting from the prolonged implementation of the policy on expansionary demand and fully invigorate the vitality of supply and civilian-run enterprises by strengthening the " secondary " impetus , thereby laying a solid foundation for the long-term , sustained stability of the national economy .  
Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
The motion was advanced by the 114 deputies of the Anhui delegation to the NPC session .  It holds that , at this critical moment when tax for fees reform and regulating funds for public undertakings in rural areas will be fully carried out , it is imperative to establish a system for sharing compulsory education funds between the central and local authorities according to a certain proportion in order to prevent peasants ' excessive burden and consolidate the results of the trial of tax for fees reform at selected places .

Our objective is to relax excessive control in the rental market .  
Family doctor Tony Shieh says that the most direct way to reduce sexual stimulation is exercise , which lowers seminal vesicle activity , releases energy , and preempts blood from filling up the sex organ . Besides this , a cold shower before bed , light calisthenics , wearing loose-fitting underwear , avoiding a too-warm blanket , and keeping an active lifestyle to tire oneself out are all ways to help overcome excessive sexual desire .  
Most downstream pollution comes from industrial and residential sources , but in sparsely populated upstream regions , not only have the water and soil been damaged by tea plantations , fruit orchards and vegetable farms , but excessive use of fertilizers has led to half of the reservoirs becoming infested with algae .  
Last year the Amei River , located to the east of the Hsiu-kuluan River , and which originates in the Coastal Mountain Range , flooded over because of excessive silt buildup downstream . This year , the central , provincial , and county governments are preparing to spend NT $ 100 million to deal with this tiny , lessthan-10-kilometer-long stream .

That 's why it is necessary to have reserve electric power . But many scholars believe that Taiwan has always had adequate electrical power capacity . The problem lies in management shortcomings at Taipower . For example , poor maintenance and an excessive shutdown rate lower electrical supply , creating a situation in which actual supply can not meet the demands of users , thus creating the need for occasional rationing .  
" This is not just an issue about 200 people 's livelihoods , or who 's going to take over . It 's more about redefining Peking opera and readjusting the guidelines for national cultural development , " says National Institute of the Arts teacher Wen Chiu-chu , who just completed research on " Taiwanese Peking opera .

According to Turtles of the World , which was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 , excessive culling , along with highway construction in developed countries , is a main reason turtle and tortoise populations are now facing a general crisis . In particular , the trade in turtles as meat and pets is booming as never before . With tortoises and turtles of large and small species alike being adopted as pets or turned into culinary delicacies , there 's no way for these chelonians to fulfill their duty of passing on their genetic legacy .  
" The biggest threat is in academic books , " says Chen Hsin-yuan . Taiwan has developed a get-rich-quick culture in recent years . There has been little attention paid to author development or basic research , and there has been excessive reliance on products published in the PRC , leading to a insufficient number of books originating in Taiwan .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
In the reign of emperor Han Wu Di ( 141-87 BC ) , Dong Zhongshu tried to use catastrophes to hold the emperor in check and prevent excessive concentration of political power in his hands . He argued that unusual heavenly events portended major changes in the course of human affairs , and championed the idea that one could predict the future by observing the stars .  
5 . Pay attention to the theoretical system underlying a spiritual cultivation method : As well as the theory itself , also observe whether this theoretical system links in with secular systems of knowledge . Excessive rejection of other ideas is usually a sign that something is amiss , but excessive tolerance or an attitude that anything goes is also too undiscerning .  
In fact , in a survey carried out two years ago by the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation and National Tsing Hua University , almost 40% of fish sampled from food markets contained excessive levels of " persistent organic pollutants , " which are likely to act as environmental hormones . However , following angry protests from fishermen after the report was published , no action was taken .  
Chen feels that leaving white space is more difficult to master than the actual artwork , because all that space can easily end up looking excessive , or even downright vacant . That is why he is so careful about blank space . Besides , white and black are two of his favorite colors .  
In the past Taiwan placed excessive importance on fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and created a monopoly of electrical power supply , thereby excluding opportunities for development of renewable sources of energy . Thus the President emphasized , " In the future we should , acting through liberalization of the power market and various subsidy measures , increase incentives for diversification of sources of energy . "  
This summer two typhoons hit Tai - wan in close succession , washing away homes and crops , destroying roads , and killing people , demonstrating again the awesome power of nature .

Successful countries have been those that have been capable of attracting a high level of external capital inflows while , through active macroeconomic policies , avoiding the over-heating of domestic demand , excessive exchange rate appreciation and volatile interest rates .  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .

Two United Nations reports on these tragic incidents state clearly that the responsibility lies with Turkey and the illegal Turkish-Cypriot regime , which used excessive and unwarranted force against unarmed demonstrators who were simply trying to remind the world that for 22 years Cyprus has remained a divided country whose people are still prevented by the Turkish occupation forces from returning to their homes and lands and from moving freely in their country . 
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
The overwhelming burden of external debt , excessive dependence on a few commodities , rapid population growth , serious deterioration of nutritional indicators , environmental degradation with the recurring problems of drought and desertification social tensions and ongoing conflicts reveal only part of the grave consequences of increasing marginalization of African countries from the world economy .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,

Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
Fiscal regimes applied to natural resources have a long way to go in discouraging the excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources and / or mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources for sustainable development .  
In practice , the ongoing reform of natural resource fiscal regimes in various countries has a long way to go in mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources and at the same time discouraging excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources .  
During the period in question , the 411 complaints admitted fell into the following categories : ( a ) torture ( 6.3 per cent ) , an appalling practice which the administrative measures taken against certain officials involved in such cases have not managed to eradicate completely ; ( b ) cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ( 19.2 per cent ) ; ( c ) excessive use of force ( 3.4 per cent ) ; and ( d ) other threats ( 71.1 per cent ) .

Three main problems were identified : virtually all ministries lack qualified personnel at appropriate levels to expedite externally assisted projects ; bureaucratic obstacles on the part of the Government - but also on the part of the donors - retard and even impede project implementation ; lack of coordination among donors in some sectors leads to excessive demands on the time of the Minister concerned and already overworked ministerial staff who are at times obliged to analyse and choose among similar projects presented by different donors .  
A subject of utmost concern to the Special Committee was the Israeli decision to open an archaeological tunnel beneath the Temple Mount , which had been viewed as a grave provocation by Muslims throughout the world and had sparked the worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the beginning of the peace process , in which the Israeli army had responded with excessive force and incursions into the self-rule areas under exclusive Palestinian control .

At a time when the international community is struggling to deal with the problems of environmental degradation resulting from the excessive use of fossil fuel , the Agency 's achievements in the area of nuclear safety underline the merits of nuclear energy as the most feasible and attractive alternative to fossil fuel .  
Data must be adequate , relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which they are held ; be accurate and for the registered purpose ; and surrounded by proper security .  
In such conflicts , particularly in the case of a civil war , it is often difficult to determine which party is guilty of violating the peace , and the sanctions themselves may be indiscriminate , non-specific and , consequently ineffective and may only increase the already excessive burdens and sufferings borne by the innocent civilian population .

They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .

In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
The IPTF investigation concluded that the west Mostar police had used excessive force , in violation of national and international human rights standards , and that they had attempted to cover up the facts of the incident .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
As argued in World Economic and Social Survey , 1997,3 Governments need to be sensitive to the fact that excessive enthusiasm for the quick reduction of budget deficits can have high economic and social cost and may not even be required for the fiscal probity that is indeed necessary in the medium run .  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

The Advisory Committee also devoted considerable attention to extrabudgetary funds in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997,9 where it addressed the presentation of information on trust funds in the budget document , the primacy of United Nations regulations and rules with regard to any conditions attached to special purpose contributions and the need for a standard format and procedures for reporting on trust funds to donors with a view to reducing the administrative burden and excessive overheads .  
Yet while today it is the Congolese people who are hostages , perhaps tomorrow it will be another people 's turn to be taken hostage by a political class that is driven by selfish ambitions , unprepared to accept the rules of democracy and uninterested in seeking and maintaining peace .  Every day and at an increasing human cost , the excessive demands of some and the lack of tolerance of others defer to a later date the establishment of conditions for a negotiated peace .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
On the contrary , experience demonstrates that excessive government interference with trade union rights and restrictions on collective bargaining leads to a progressive build-up of industrial relations tension and eventually can result in severe public protests and widespread strikes , with detrimental effects for economic and political stability .  
The Council also expressed grave concern about the excessive level of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including the introduction of sophisticated weaponry .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
An appropriate balance must also be struck between including all the substantive and procedural norms necessary to ensure proper criminal procedure and the need to avoid an excessive level of detail which could impede the success of the initiative .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .

Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
Given the serious consequences of the problem as described above , this is a promising time to analyse the small arms and light weapons in use in recent conflicts , the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer , as well as to recommend to Member States , regional organizations and the international community as a whole , particularly as represented by the United Nations , practical measures to prevent and reduce the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of such weapons , with a view to diminishing their role in exacerbating conflicts .  
Attention should be drawn to the need to strike a balance between the interests of the various States so as to reduce the gap between the excessive well-being of some and the alarming poverty of others , since , in an increasingly interdependent world which shared a common destiny , solutions to environmental problems must be closely interrelated .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
Since the market and other informational failures that lay behind their taking on such excessive aggregate market exposures in East Asia were massive , the required regulatory changes would have to be far-reaching and the early warning systems elaborate .  
Additional constraints included the small size of their domestic markets , the vulnerability of their economies to external shocks owing to excessive dependence on a narrow range of exports and the difficulty of gaining access to international capital markets .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
With the sporadic outbreak of local conflicts , the excessive accumulations of small arms and light weapons have not only had direct human costs , but also brought immeasurable social and economic dislocation .  
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
The conference , for this purpose , should consider the main factors leading and contributing to the excessive accumulation of small arms and may adopt a plan of action consisting of specific coordinated efforts by the international community to reduce and prevent illicit trafficking as well as to face and resolve the problems associated with the excessive accumulation of small arms .  
According to the indictment , many of the detainees under the accused 's control were subjected to inhumane treatment , including excessive and cruel interrogation , physical and psychological harm , forced labour in hazardous conditions and being used as " human shields " , and some of the detainees were murdered or otherwise killed .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
In conclusion , while the efforts of the Council to lend its voice to the efforts to halt the excessive accumulation of and traffic in small arms is laudable , we wish to caution that the underlying sociological , economic and political causes of conflict must be addressed so as to create conditions of stability and thus reduce the need for arms and , consequently , for conflict .  
If the parties raised preliminary objections for tactical rather than objective reasons , pleaded at excessive length and attached long annexes to their pleadings or called for unduly extended oral proceedings , the length of the proceedings would be drawn out .  
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;
