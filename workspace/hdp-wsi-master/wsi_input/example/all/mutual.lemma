Speak highly of the positive role that the " Shanghai Five " has played with respect to promoting and deepening good neighborliness , mutual trust , and friendly relations ; and to consolidating regional security and stability and promoting common development between member countries ever since its establishment five years ago ;  
On the sound basis of political mutual trust , China attaches importance to developing economic cooperation with neighboring countries and has actively uplifted economic cooperation to a higher level .  
The " Shanghai spirit " cultivated by the Shanghai Five process of mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , consultation , respect for cultural pluralism , and seeking common development , is a summary of the experiences of the five countries in handling mutual relations ; in addition , it is of important practical significance in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order of justice and reason .  
It stands for extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange to put peace and security on a more solid foundation .  " Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
The two governments agreed to develop bilateral relations of friendly cooperation on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-intervention in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  They also agreed that while maintaining good political relations , efforts would be made to actively open up exchanges and cooperation in other fields , especially in economy and trade .  
The vast numbers of overseas Chinese and the social organizations have a multifaceted connection with China . We can fully put into play the advantages and preferential conditions of language , customs , as well as relations and rural friendships .  On the basis of mutual advantages , we can open cooperative exchanges in multiple channels and broad territories .  
There are differences between countries in their social systems , ideological thinking , perceptions of values , and religious beliefs ; therefore , in international relations , we should strictly observe the basic principles of mutually respecting each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality , mutual benefits , and peaceful coexistence .  
We should strive for diversification of property rights through multiple forms , such as standard public listing of companies , mutual purchase of shares by legal persons , domestic natural person investment , foreign investment , conversion of bank credits rights to equity , market share subscription , stock right transaction , and the holding of shares by employees of a company , and gradually establish and improve a standard system of corporate governance .  
He said that in recent years the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries of China and Cuba have developed rapidly , there has been mutual understanding and support in the political field , economic cooperation has unceasingly expanded , various exchanges have increased day by day , and there is close cooperation in the midst of international struggle .  
National unity has been further strengthened , socialist national relations marked by equality , unity and mutual aid have been consolidated and developed , and the bonding forces of the people of every nationality in the region toward the motherland have been further enhanced .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
First of all , an international investigation commission on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict headed by former US Senator Mitchell officially presented its report on 21 May after more than six months of investigations .  This put forward specific proposals on halting the violent conflict , rebuilding mutual trust , and reviving the peace talks , and provided a good opportunity for active US intervention .  
He said : The treaty of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance signed between the two countries four decades ago is a great event in the history of bilateral relations .  It has not only promoted exchanges and cooperation in numerous spheres between our two countries but also strengthened the unity and friendship between our two sides and played a major role in safeguarding world peace .  
Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
This treaty will become a legal document guiding the development of bilateral relations in the new century , and it is bound to have a far-reaching positive impact on the two countries in developing enduring good neighborly , friendly , and mutual beneficial and cooperative relations .  
It is quite unreasonable for Japan to make wild comments about China 's normal national defense construction in an official publication such as its " Defense White Paper , " and this does not help to promote mutual understanding and trust between the two countries in the military security field .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
Jiang Zemin said that several years ago , China and Russia declared the establishment of strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century in accordance with changes in the international situation and proceeding from the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
Still more important , following the reliable legal guarantee for all-round development of bilateral relations provided by the " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly Friendship and Cooperation , " a new page will be turned in this relationship in the new century , and in the face of the new-style state relations of mutual trust and benefit established by China and Russia , the disintegration strategy pushed by the sole superpower in combination with its cold war mentality unilateralism will be of no avail .  
The " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly friendship and Cooperation " sets down in legal form the aspirations and resolve of China and Russia to be forever good neighbors , good partners , and good friends , and totally discards the cold war mentality of being either in alliance or confrontation ; it is an expression of the new-style interstate relations of seeking security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit , and is a programmatic document guiding the healthy and steady development of Sino-Russian relations in the new century .  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
Second , this treaty discards the old mentality and pattern of the cold war period by which interstate relations were either in alliance or confrontational , and has laid down for Sino-Russian relations the properties of being nonaligned , non-confrontational , and not being aimed at any third country , thus setting a good example for the international community in pursuing security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .  
It can be fairly said that with concerted efforts by the two sides , we have established comprehensive , friendly , and cooperative bilateral relations .  Such relations are based on the guiding principle of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs and are characteristic of great trust and close cooperation .  
Over the 10 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , relations of bilateral cooperation have developed smoothly .  There have been frequent mutual visits at a high level and the two sides have established a basic framework and principle for cooperation in political , economic , trade , cultural and other fields .  
Today , President Jiang Zemin held talks with President Alexander Lukashenko and met Prime Minister Vladimir Yermoshin and speakers of the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic .

President Jiang Said : " In this visit to your honorable country , I want to increase my understanding of your honorable country ; to exchange deep ideas with president De Marko and other leaders of your honorable country concerning developing relations between our two countries , and international problems of mutual concern ; to have broad contact with people in various fields in your country - - doing all this to increase the friendship between the people 's of the two countries , and to propel the development of Sino-Maltese relations to a new standard .

The seminar , marked in the beginning by mutual suspicions and by heated debates , has evolved finally into in-depth and rational discussions .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
On the basis of bilateral cooperation and in accordance with the respective development targets and advantages of China and ASEAN , the Chinese side proposes to identify the five areas of agriculture , human resources development , cooperative development of the Mekong River Basin , information and communications technologies and mutual investment as key areas for China-ASEAN cooperation in the first few years of the new century in order to make more effective and centralized use of the resources and strengths of both sides .  
The 16 November letter indicated that , " Your association 's representatives propose that at this working discussion , with the precondition of mutual understanding , each side will use the verbal statement method to express the one-China principle , and propose the specific content of the expression , and this will make it explicit that both sides of the strait support the one-China principle .  This content will thereafter be conveyed to Taiwan publications . "

Since reform and opening up two decades ago , Fujian-Taiwan trade and economic exchanges and cooperation have developed steadily , their quality and level have been constantly increased , and people-to-people and social and cultural exchanges have become increasingly frequent , initially bringing about a situation of economic complementarity and mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development .  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation .

Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
" We are of the opinion that the two sides can create a favorable condition for reaching an ultimate reasonable solution to the issue , so long as they respect historical facts and make friendly consultations based on the principle of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation . "  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Chi Haotian said : Since China and Azerbaijan established diplomatic ties , bilateral ties have developed smoothly .  The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .  China would also like to develop multilevel exchanges between the two armies in various fields on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit .  
Foreign ministers of the two countries also signed a joint statement recently on future bilateral cooperation , thus defining the direction of the growth of Sino-Indonesian comprehensive , friendly , and cooperative relations of mutual benefit .  
They completed the initial draft of the " great democratic constitution " in June that year ; this openly proclaimed that " Taiwan and mainland China should be based on the principle of peace , equality , coexistence , and mutual benefit , and respect each other 's national sovereignty and the integrity of the right to rule the areas under their jurisdiction , " and " the governments of Taiwan and mainland China should deal with all business according to international law and convention . "  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin praised highly the visit of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il at the important historical moment of the turn of the century .  He maintained that the current visit is of important significance to further improvement of mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and two countries , and to the promotion of development of Sino-DPRK friendly relations [ zhong chao you hao guan xi ] oriented toward the new century .  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
The North and the South have markedly enhanced their mutual trust .  When problems occurred , Kim Chong-il and Kim T'ae-chung exercised restraint and took the initiative to express their goodwill toward each other .  Their unremitting efforts and correct decisions have eventually been crowned with the historical summit .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
While continuing to give play to the advantage of the eastern region , the strategy of the development of the western region will be implemented , the development of the central and western regions will be quickened , and mutual promotion and coordinate development between the eastern , central and western regions will be enhanced with sustained economic growth .  
Both sides have agreed to promote the development of the national economy through economic cooperation , and to enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust by boosting cooperation and exchange in the social , cultural , sports , public health , environment , and other fields .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the two parties ' improving relations on the peninsula is in accord with both sides ' fundamental interests and with the common aspirations of the Korean nationality .  He expressed the belief that the meeting would enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides , promote both sides ' exchanges and cooperation in various fields , and ultimately create an excellent opening for realizing independence and peaceful unification on the peninsula .  
Both sides have decided to exchange visiting groups of separated families and relatives in as early as coming August , and both are prepared to promote mutual cooperation and exchange in social , cultural , and other fields through economic cooperation .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations in mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
At present Sino-US relations are facing new opportunities .  The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
The Chinese Government has attached importance to the development of relationship with Britain and is willing to bring about long-term , stable , and sound development of this friendly relationship and cooperation in the principle of mutual respect , the sought of common ground while reserving difference , equal and mutual benefit , and joint development .  
Finally , Zhu Rongji emphasized China 's readiness to join hands with Bulgaria in actively promoting lasting , stable and comprehensive development of friendly bilateral relations in the 21st century , in striving to tap potential in mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of complete equality , mutual respect , seeking common grounds while reserving differences , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and in constantly substantiating the contents of bilateral relations , strengthening cooperation in international affairs , and safeguarding common interests .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
In recent years , the five countries have basically solved their boundary problems left by history through friendly consultation .  They have mutually reduced their troop strength in the border areas , and built and strengthened mutual trust , thus protecting peace and tranquility in the border areas .  
During the visit , the two heads of state held talks , and in a constructive atmosphere of mutual understanding , discussed the question of further developing the two countries ' relations of good neighborliness , friendship , and cooperation , and also exchanged views and reached broad consensus on international and regional issues of common concern .  
Your Excellency the President has paid three visits to China . This , together with the summit meetings of the five nations and other international occasions , has enabled us to meet on more than 10 occasions and to establish good working relations and personal friendship .  This has played a very important role in deepening mutual understanding and trust and promoting the development of relations of good-neighborliness , friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  
They point out that continual talks will be held between China and Russia and between China and Tajikistan on thoroughly solving the remaining border issues as quickly as possible on the basis of the current border treaties according to the universally recognized norms of international law , through negotiation on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation .  
3 .  All sides point out that the agreements reached between the five countries in settling border issues and enhancing military trust have embodied a new security view that is built on mutual trust , equality , and cooperation ; are conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and good-neighborly relations ; and have contributed in a constructive manner to ensuring stability in this extensive region .  
Kok appreciated the achievements scored by China in human rights .  Because of the differences in historic , economic , and social development between various countries , it is very important for them to carry out constructive dialogue based on mutual respect .  
The two sides will , in accordance with the laws of respective countries and bilateral agreements , encourage and protect mutual investment , strengthen the exchanges and cooperation between relevant departments of the two countries , create favorable economic , financial and legal conditions , as well as other conditions , for cooperation between major trade and economic bodies of the two countries , and provide them with necessary support .  
At the same time , both sides unanimously agreed that there are enormous potential and good prospects for trade and economic cooperation between the two countries and the trade and economic cooperation should be further expanded on the basis of equality and mutual benefit so that they will reach a level commensurate with the economic potential of the two countries .  
The above mutual understanding regarding specific issues that was reached by the two leaders made both sides more full of confidence regarding the prospects for relations between China and Italy , which have numerous points in common politically , have strong complementary natures economically , and have great potential for development .  
Zhu Rongji made clear to the countries visited that China holds an active attitude of developing bilateral ties , and emphasized China 's willingness to strengthen political dialogue and consultations with these countries on the basis of mutual respect , reciprocity based on equality , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Reasons for achieving this are as follows : First , all previous governments of the two countries and their leaders paid high attention to the development of bilateral relations .  Leaders of the older generations of the two countries threw lots of energy into the causes of friendship between the two countries .  Like leaders of the older generations , leaders of the new generation of the two countries have maintained close contacts , intensified mutual trust and understanding , and provided guarantees for promoting an in-depth development of contacts and cooperation in all fields .  
When receiving visiting US Secretary of Defense Cohen in Beijing recently , President Jiang Zemin spoke with him in a grave tone and with sincerity : The Chinese and US Governments and leaders should look far ahead from a high ground , be oriented to the future , grasp the general direction of Sino-US relations from a strategic height and long-term angle , and properly handle Sino-US relations on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and in the spirit of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
Fan Xizhou , Chen Kongli , Lin Jing , and Liu Guoshen , Taiwan issue experts of the Taiwan Affairs Research Institute of Xiamen University , today expressed their views on " mutual invitations by Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors for mutual visits . "  They said that mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors have positive significance on promoting the two cities ' economic and cultural exchanges and developing their relations .  People on both sides of the strait are optimistically looking forward to the success of their visits .  
Associate Professor Liu Guoshen said : Mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors seem like the first light of the day in the current critical cross-strait relations .  These visits , serving as an opportunity for both sides of the strait to advance toward mutual trust and reconciliation , can not come true because of obstructions by the Taiwan side under " all sorts of pretexts . "  This is regrettable .  
During the visit , Hu said that he would call on his Excellency President Abdurahman Wahid , exchange views with Megawati in a frank and sincere manner on bilateral relations and issues of common concern , and meet well-known Indonesian personages from all walks of life .  He hoped that the visit would enhance mutual understanding and trust between the two countries and be beneficial to the healthy development of Sino-Indonesian good-neighborly relations of mutual trust and all-round cooperation .  
Not long ago , China and Indonesia jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties and signed a joint statement that has drawn a blueprint for mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides in various fields in the new century and clearly and definitely indicated that the two countries will establish a long and stable relationship of good-neighborliness , mutual trust and comprehensive cooperation .  
He hoped that the two sides would continue maintaining close cooperation ; enhance mutual support in the areas of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ; put forth joint efforts opposing interference from without , promoting the establishment of a just and rational new world political and economic order , and protecting the legitimate rights of developing nations .  
and ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992 , the two countries have achieved fruitful results in constantly expanding mutual exchange and cooperation in political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and other fields as well as in international affairs .  
Both sides unanimously held that all countries have the right to choose their social system , economic system and path of development according to their own national conditions , and that China and Belurus should strengthen mutual understanding and support , learn from each other , and use each other 's experience for reference , and should make joint efforts to develop comprehensive friendly cooperation at a deeper level in the new century in order to benefit the peoples of the two countries . 
This is due to the personal encouragement from the leaders of the two countries .  On the basis of the " Shanghai Five " summit meeting mechanism , both sides have carried out very fruitful cooperation , signed the five-nation border trust agreement , the disarmament agreement , and three joint statements , and developed a brand new mode for building mutual trust and maintaining regional peace .  Meanwhile , they have also greatly promoted the development of the Sino-Kazakh bilateral relations .  
Based on the spirit of friendly consultation and mutual understanding and mutual compromising , they have completely and thoroughly settled the border issues between the two sides left from history , and turned the 1,700-km long Sino-Kazakh common border into a link of goodly neighborliness and friendliness .  
Hu Jintao separately met and held talks with the heads of states , heads of governments , and parliamentary leaders of the five countries .  He also had extensive contacts with people from various circles .  His visit had enhanced mutual understanding , promoted bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation , and pushed forward the comprehensive development of bilateral relations between China and the five countries .  
Both sides unanimously agreed to make concerted efforts to build up good neighborly and friendly relations and to settle problems that are currently existing in their bilateral relations , with a view to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship and to promoting mutual exchanges in all fields .  
The responsible persons of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation , the Provincial Intellectual Property Rights Bureau , and the Shenyang Cross-Strait Science and Technology Industrial Park briefed the visitors on the situation of Liaoning Province and the Liaoning-Taiwan economic and technological cooperation and trade .  The two sides thoroughly discussed projects of common interest and reached a preliminary mutual intent on some joint-venture and cooperative projects .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Jamyang recalled with deep feeling the tenth Panchen Lama and Zhao Puchu , a lay Buddhist of noble character and high prestige .  He praised them for " becoming a model for the Chinese Buddhist world by forming close cooperative relations in a mutual lofty undertaking . "  
He said that it is only through mutual adaptation to the process of modern civilization , and mutual adaptation to development , progress , unity , and well being of the entire Tibetan nation , that Tibetan national culture can be safeguarded , developed , and continued .  Only by economic development , while at the same time improving the lives of the people , can Tibetan culture be better preserved .

First , the establishment of mechanisms for military mutual trust must be based on a framework of bilateral or multilateral ties , that is , the parties concerned must have existing basic mechanisms to hold dialogues and channels to facilitate cooperation , and one of the most important preconditions is that they have a certain level of political mutual trust .  Without political consensus and trust , a mechanism for military mutual trust will be infeasible both theoretically and in practice .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .

"  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .

Bush said that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the United States signed with the Soviet Union in 1972 was " outdated , " and he discarded the defense policy based on mutual deterrence over the past 10 years , thus triggering off a new arms race by adding more and more offensive weapons to the defense system and expanding the weapon system to the outer space .

The " Shanghai Five " mechanism advocates good neighborly relations , mutual trust , equality , mutual benefits , unity , cooperation , and joint development .  It has provided the international community with valuable experience and inspiration in abandoning the Cold War mentality and in actively exploring for a new type of state-to-state relations , a new type of security view , and a new type of regional cooperation model in the post-Cold War era , and has made positive contributions to world peace and stability .  
The " Shanghai Spirit " , which has been developed during the process of the " Shanghai Five " , shows the characteristics of mutual trust and benefit , equality , consultation , mutual respect to different civilizations , and common prosperity .

" Shanghai Spirit " speaks for mutual respect and seeking common points while reserving differences , which has been proved to be the only realistic choice for countries of different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to attain a peaceful coexistence .  
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .

This treaty will become a legal document guiding the development of bilateral relations in the new century , and it is bound to have a far-reaching positive impact on the two countries in developing enduring good neighborly , friendly , and mutual beneficial and cooperative relations .

Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
Jiang Zemin said that several years ago , China and Russia declared the establishment of strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century in accordance with changes in the international situation and proceeding from the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
Still more important , following the reliable legal guarantee for all-round development of bilateral relations provided by the " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly Friendship and Cooperation , " a new page will be turned in this relationship in the new century , and in the face of the new-style state relations of mutual trust and benefit established by China and Russia , the disintegration strategy pushed by the sole superpower in combination with its cold war mentality unilateralism will be of no avail .  
The " Sino-Russian Treaty of Good neighborly friendship and Cooperation " sets down in legal form the aspirations and resolve of China and Russia to be forever good neighbors , good partners , and good friends , and totally discards the cold war mentality of being either in alliance or confrontation ; it is an expression of the new-style interstate relations of seeking security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit , and is a programmatic document guiding the healthy and steady development of Sino-Russian relations in the new century .  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
Second , this treaty discards the old mentality and pattern of the cold war period by which interstate relations were either in alliance or confrontational , and has laid down for Sino-Russian relations the properties of being nonaligned , non-confrontational , and not being aimed at any third country , thus setting a good example for the international community in pursuing security through trust and cooperation through mutual benefit .

Such relations are based on the guiding principle of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs and are characteristic of great trust and close cooperation .

The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation . "  
Sun Yuxi said : President Jiang 's upcoming visits will be an important diplomatic move made by China at the turn of the century .  The purpose of the visits are to step up high-level exchange between China and the aforementioned six countries , ensure further development of bilateral relations , and exchange views with them on the current international situation and the situations in regions of concern , in order to enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation on international and regional affairs .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
President Jiang 's current visits to the six countries is China 's important diplomatic action at the turn of the century aimed at strengthening high-level contacts between China and the above-mentioned six countries to further develop their bilateral ties and exchange views on the international and relevant regional situation .  The visits will increase their mutual understanding and enhance their cooperation in international and regional affairs .  
Through this round of visits , China has strengthened high-level contacts with the nations concerned , promoted the further development of bilateral relations with them , enhanced mutual understanding with them , and strengthened cooperation with them in international and regional affairs .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
" We are of the opinion that the two sides can create a favorable condition for reaching an ultimate reasonable solution to the issue , so long as they respect historical facts and make friendly consultations based on the principle of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation . "  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Chi Haotian said : Since China and Azerbaijan established diplomatic ties , bilateral ties have developed smoothly .  The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .  China would also like to develop multilevel exchanges between the two armies in various fields on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit .  
Foreign ministers of the two countries also signed a joint statement recently on future bilateral cooperation , thus defining the direction of the growth of Sino-Indonesian comprehensive , friendly , and cooperative relations of mutual benefit .  
They completed the initial draft of the " great democratic constitution " in June that year ; this openly proclaimed that " Taiwan and mainland China should be based on the principle of peace , equality , coexistence , and mutual benefit , and respect each other 's national sovereignty and the integrity of the right to rule the areas under their jurisdiction , " and " the governments of Taiwan and mainland China should deal with all business according to international law and convention . "  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin praised highly the visit of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il at the important historical moment of the turn of the century .  He maintained that the current visit is of important significance to further improvement of mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and two countries , and to the promotion of development of Sino-DPRK friendly relations [ zhong chao you hao guan xi ] oriented toward the new century .  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The DPRK has regarded the issue of improving South-North relations as a major subject for the realization of a peaceful reunification on the peninsula ; and by putting forward such suggestions as holding high-level political talks , it intends to push the North-South relations towards reconciliation and unity , and to seek coexistence , common prosperity , and mutual benefits between the North and the South .  
Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
The North and the South have markedly enhanced their mutual trust .  When problems occurred , Kim Chong-il and Kim T'ae-chung exercised restraint and took the initiative to express their goodwill toward each other .  Their unremitting efforts and correct decisions have eventually been crowned with the historical summit .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
While continuing to give play to the advantage of the eastern region , the strategy of the development of the western region will be implemented , the development of the central and western regions will be quickened , and mutual promotion and coordinate development between the eastern , central and western regions will be enhanced with sustained economic growth .  
Both sides have agreed to promote the development of the national economy through economic cooperation , and to enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust by boosting cooperation and exchange in the social , cultural , sports , public health , environment , and other fields .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the two parties ' improving relations on the peninsula is in accord with both sides ' fundamental interests and with the common aspirations of the Korean nationality .  He expressed the belief that the meeting would enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the two sides , promote both sides ' exchanges and cooperation in various fields , and ultimately create an excellent opening for realizing independence and peaceful unification on the peninsula .  
Both sides have decided to exchange visiting groups of separated families and relatives in as early as coming August , and both are prepared to promote mutual cooperation and exchange in social , cultural , and other fields through economic cooperation .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations in mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
At present Sino-US relations are facing new opportunities .  The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
The Chinese Government has attached importance to the development of relationship with Britain and is willing to bring about long-term , stable , and sound development of this friendly relationship and cooperation in the principle of mutual respect , the sought of common ground while reserving difference , equal and mutual benefit , and joint development .  
Finally , Zhu Rongji emphasized China 's readiness to join hands with Bulgaria in actively promoting lasting , stable and comprehensive development of friendly bilateral relations in the 21st century , in striving to tap potential in mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of complete equality , mutual respect , seeking common grounds while reserving differences , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , and in constantly substantiating the contents of bilateral relations , strengthening cooperation in international affairs , and safeguarding common interests .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
In recent years , the five countries have basically solved their boundary problems left by history through friendly consultation .  They have mutually reduced their troop strength in the border areas , and built and strengthened mutual trust , thus protecting peace and tranquility in the border areas .  
During the visit , the two heads of state held talks , and in a constructive atmosphere of mutual understanding , discussed the question of further developing the two countries ' relations of good neighborliness , friendship , and cooperation , and also exchanged views and reached broad consensus on international and regional issues of common concern .  
Your Excellency the President has paid three visits to China . This , together with the summit meetings of the five nations and other international occasions , has enabled us to meet on more than 10 occasions and to establish good working relations and personal friendship .  This has played a very important role in deepening mutual understanding and trust and promoting the development of relations of good-neighborliness , friendship and cooperation between the two countries .  
They point out that continual talks will be held between China and Russia and between China and Tajikistan on thoroughly solving the remaining border issues as quickly as possible on the basis of the current border treaties according to the universally recognized norms of international law , through negotiation on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation .  
3 .  All sides point out that the agreements reached between the five countries in settling border issues and enhancing military trust have embodied a new security view that is built on mutual trust , equality , and cooperation ; are conducive to enhancing mutual understanding and good-neighborly relations ; and have contributed in a constructive manner to ensuring stability in this extensive region .  
Kok appreciated the achievements scored by China in human rights .  Because of the differences in historic , economic , and social development between various countries , it is very important for them to carry out constructive dialogue based on mutual respect .  
The two sides will , in accordance with the laws of respective countries and bilateral agreements , encourage and protect mutual investment , strengthen the exchanges and cooperation between relevant departments of the two countries , create favorable economic , financial and legal conditions , as well as other conditions , for cooperation between major trade and economic bodies of the two countries , and provide them with necessary support .  
At the same time , both sides unanimously agreed that there are enormous potential and good prospects for trade and economic cooperation between the two countries and the trade and economic cooperation should be further expanded on the basis of equality and mutual benefit so that they will reach a level commensurate with the economic potential of the two countries .  
The above mutual understanding regarding specific issues that was reached by the two leaders made both sides more full of confidence regarding the prospects for relations between China and Italy , which have numerous points in common politically , have strong complementary natures economically , and have great potential for development .  
Zhu Rongji made clear to the countries visited that China holds an active attitude of developing bilateral ties , and emphasized China 's willingness to strengthen political dialogue and consultations with these countries on the basis of mutual respect , reciprocity based on equality , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Reasons for achieving this are as follows : First , all previous governments of the two countries and their leaders paid high attention to the development of bilateral relations .  Leaders of the older generations of the two countries threw lots of energy into the causes of friendship between the two countries .  Like leaders of the older generations , leaders of the new generation of the two countries have maintained close contacts , intensified mutual trust and understanding , and provided guarantees for promoting an in-depth development of contacts and cooperation in all fields .  
When receiving visiting US Secretary of Defense Cohen in Beijing recently , President Jiang Zemin spoke with him in a grave tone and with sincerity : The Chinese and US Governments and leaders should look far ahead from a high ground , be oriented to the future , grasp the general direction of Sino-US relations from a strategic height and long-term angle , and properly handle Sino-US relations on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and in the spirit of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
Fan Xizhou , Chen Kongli , Lin Jing , and Liu Guoshen , Taiwan issue experts of the Taiwan Affairs Research Institute of Xiamen University , today expressed their views on " mutual invitations by Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors for mutual visits . "  They said that mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors have positive significance on promoting the two cities ' economic and cultural exchanges and developing their relations .  People on both sides of the strait are optimistically looking forward to the success of their visits .  
Associate Professor Liu Guoshen said : Mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors seem like the first light of the day in the current critical cross-strait relations .  These visits , serving as an opportunity for both sides of the strait to advance toward mutual trust and reconciliation , can not come true because of obstructions by the Taiwan side under " all sorts of pretexts . "  This is regrettable .  
During the visit , Hu said that he would call on his Excellency President Abdurahman Wahid , exchange views with Megawati in a frank and sincere manner on bilateral relations and issues of common concern , and meet well-known Indonesian personages from all walks of life .  He hoped that the visit would enhance mutual understanding and trust between the two countries and be beneficial to the healthy development of Sino-Indonesian good-neighborly relations of mutual trust and all-round cooperation .  
Not long ago , China and Indonesia jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties and signed a joint statement that has drawn a blueprint for mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides in various fields in the new century and clearly and definitely indicated that the two countries will establish a long and stable relationship of good-neighborliness , mutual trust and comprehensive cooperation .  
He hoped that the two sides would continue maintaining close cooperation ; enhance mutual support in the areas of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ; put forth joint efforts opposing interference from without , promoting the establishment of a just and rational new world political and economic order , and protecting the legitimate rights of developing nations .  
and ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992 , the two countries have achieved fruitful results in constantly expanding mutual exchange and cooperation in political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and other fields as well as in international affairs .  
Both sides unanimously held that all countries have the right to choose their social system , economic system and path of development according to their own national conditions , and that China and Belurus should strengthen mutual understanding and support , learn from each other , and use each other 's experience for reference , and should make joint efforts to develop comprehensive friendly cooperation at a deeper level in the new century in order to benefit the peoples of the two countries . 
This is due to the personal encouragement from the leaders of the two countries .  On the basis of the " Shanghai Five " summit meeting mechanism , both sides have carried out very fruitful cooperation , signed the five-nation border trust agreement , the disarmament agreement , and three joint statements , and developed a brand new mode for building mutual trust and maintaining regional peace .  Meanwhile , they have also greatly promoted the development of the Sino-Kazakh bilateral relations .  
Based on the spirit of friendly consultation and mutual understanding and mutual compromising , they have completely and thoroughly settled the border issues between the two sides left from history , and turned the 1,700-km long Sino-Kazakh common border into a link of goodly neighborliness and friendliness .  
Hu Jintao separately met and held talks with the heads of states , heads of governments , and parliamentary leaders of the five countries .

The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Jamyang recalled with deep feeling the tenth Panchen Lama and Zhao Puchu , a lay Buddhist of noble character and high prestige .  He praised them for " becoming a model for the Chinese Buddhist world by forming close cooperative relations in a mutual lofty undertaking . "

its industrial structure under went gradual readjustments ; social undertakings in areas such as science and technology , education , culture , and health made considerable progress ; the people 's living standards improved unceasingly ; and the relations of equality , unity , and mutual help between different ethnic groups have been further consolidated .  All this constitutes a solid foundation for Tibet 's better development in the new century .  Practice has proven that the party 's ethnic policy and the central authorities ' numerous principles guiding Tibet 's work are entirely correct .  
Through frequent exchanges and continual high-level contacts , both sides have enhanced mutual understandings and friendship .  Moreover , both sides have also signed about 10 agreements on bilateral cooperation , thereby laying firm foundations for further developing their bilateral ties .  
Since then , the two countries have constantly enhanced their mutual understanding and trust and expanded their cooperation year by year in the political , economic , cultural , educational and scientific and technological fields .  
The course of developing our bilateral relations in the nine years since China and Estonia established diplomatic ties shows that the bilateral relations can develop smoothly as long as both sides strictly adhere to the principle of mutual respect , mutual benefit on an equal footing , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality among all countries regardless of size , and abide by the spirit of the China-Estonia Joint Communique and Joint Statement on Establishment of Diplomatic Relations .

"  
based on the principle " equality and mutual benefit , variety of forms , attention to practical results , and joint development , " China will adopt tangible measures to greatly step up Sino-African economic and trade and social development cooperation , and continually expand the spheres and channels of cooperation ; in particular , it will encourage direct links and exchanges between Chinese and African enterprises , so that the enterprises can play a still greater role in bilateral cooperation .  
The Ambassador said : " I particularly appreciate the remarks made by the late Premier Zhou Enlai that we should ' seek common ground on major issues while reserving differences on minor points . '  Japan and China have normalized their relations for nearly 30 years , and the obligations shouldered by the two countries in maintaining world peace and prosperity have indeed been steadily growing .  Looking forward into the 21st century , I believe that Japanese-Chinese relations will definitely develop into a relationship based on solid mutual reliance that can contribute to world peace . "
