Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .

The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
In order to gather specific information on preparations for the Year , United Nations Member States , United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , and selected non-governmental organizations were requested to provide information on the establishment of focal points for the Year and designate priorities for their preparatory activities within the four dimensions of the conceptual framework for the Year .

This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .

He confirmed that the UNCTAD initiative on trade was not limited to the new round of negotiations in services but that the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , in close cooperation with the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa , had planned joint activities for the preparation of the second WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in 1998 , including on issues related to trade and investment policy , trade and competition policy , transparency in government procurement and cooperation in organizing an Africa-wide conference preparatory to the Ministerial Conference .  
Because of the sharp annual increase in the elementary and preparatory school population , and the lack of funds to build new schools or classrooms to accommodate the additional pupils , the Agency resorted to renting buildings not originally designed as schools , or to operating some schools on double shifts - that is , two administrative schools in one building .  
That training is implemented in cooperation with the five education development centres , one in each Field , and covers a wide range of courses of one - , two - or three-year duration aimed at certifying unqualified elementary and preparatory teachers or vocational training instructors , meeting curricular changes and developing the supervisory and leadership skills of senior education staff .

Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .

The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .

Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Such support mainly involves the assignment of specialized staff to carry out preparatory tasks in a variety of areas , ranging from substantive issues to matters relating to the development of a working methodology and procedures , the preparation of a chronology for the period covered by the Commission 's work , and administrative and logistical matters , which include everything from the recruitment of support staff selected by the members of the Commission to the renting and refurbishing of office space .  
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
Based on the lessons drawn from those experiences , UNICEF had concentrated its activities , throughout the preparatory process for Habitat II and during the Conference itself , on putting children at the centre of the concerns of Habitat II , identifying poverty as the main cause of ill health in urban children , developing policies that led to a better distribution of the fruits of economic growth , reaffirming housing rights and defending the role of cities in guaranteeing the well-being of their inhabitants and not merely economic growth . 
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .

In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
Regrettably , in view of the complexity of the subject and the diversity of views on some contentious issues , the preparatory committee has not been able to finalize its work on the main substantive document for the special session , and has decided to recommend that the General Assembly at its fifty-third session authorize the Commission on Population and Development acting as the preparatory committee to hold a resumed session for four days in May or June 1999 in order to complete its work .

Many delegations expressed appreciation for the comprehensive and clear strategy outlined in the report , and for the collaborative and transparent preparatory process , which had involved a wide range of partners .  
The regulatory activities of the judges during the first half of 1994 , which for journalists were overly technical and which held little meaning among the general public , together with the preparatory work of the Deputy Prosecutor , which appeared dry work , were not initially helpful to the Tribunal when it came to overcoming the scepticism expressed throughout the first months of its existence .  
The Commission urged all members and associate members to take prompt action to establish national coordinating mechanisms for the Year , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Commission to undertake several specific measures , including the convening of a regional intergovernmental preparatory meeting and the initiation of a series of country studies on the role of the family in development .  
A wide array of activities was undertaken at the regional level , including four regional preparatory meetings , with the objective of supporting and supplementing national and local efforts .  
The preparatory activities for the Conference were characterized by intense collaboration among Governments , the Secretariat and the organizations of the United Nations system , and by the unprecedented involvement and strong support of other intergovernmental organizations and an extremely broad spectrum of non-governmental actors at the international , regional , subregional and national levels .  
Regional meetings to prepare for the mid-term global review were organized by the relevant United Nations regional commissions in accordance with paragraph 4 ( c ) of General Assembly resolution 49 / 98 , and the substantive inputs provided through the preparatory process at this level were transmitted to the Donor-Recipient Meeting in May-June 1995 and to the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting itself . 
The discussions and debate in the informal drafting group were intensive and were marked by wide and active participation on the part of delegations , reflecting the importance of the issues addressed by the preparatory process .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
A considerable momentum had been created and a commensurate political will was required to avoid protracted discussions and ensure that preparatory work was completed in time for a diplomatic conference in 1997 .  
had set up a national committee on human settlements that was coordinating joint efforts among Government organs , local authorities and non-governmental organizations with a view to effective participation in the preparatory process and in the Conference .  
Also invites the international community to make substantial contributions to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and holding of the World Food Summit as well as to facilitate the full and effective participation of representatives of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , both at the preparatory meetings for the Summit to be held in January and September 1996 and at the Summit itself ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Thus , seven preparatory studies have been undertaken in fields as diverse and important as the following : first , remuneration in the civil service ; second ; summary of audits conducted in certain Ministries ; third , rapid diagnostic assessments of Ministries that have not been audited ; fourth , administrative practices and the State of law ; fifth , analysis of the general status of the civil service ; sixth , inquiry into the image of the public sector ; and , seventh , ethics , professional conduct and motivation of State employees .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The Commission may recall that at its fourth session , all delegations and representatives of the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that contributed to the debate on the Ninth Congress expressed their satisfaction with the successful conduct of the proceedings and its productive results , in spite of the fact that the time available for pre-Congress consultations and the Ninth Congress itself had to be shortened , that the venue of the Congress had to be changed , and that all preparatory arrangements had to be completed in only a few months .  
At its 1st plenary meeting , on 5 February , after the representative of the United States of America raised a question to which the Chairman responded , the Preparatory Committee accredited to the Conference , and its preparatory process the international associations of local authorities listed in A / CONF . 165 / PC . 3 / 2 / Add . 2 ( see annex I , decision 3 / 2 ) .  
Non-governmental organizations in general consultative status , special consultative status and on the Roster which express their wish to attend the international conferences convened by the United Nations in the economic , social and related fields , and the meetings of the preparatory bodies of said conferences , shall be accredited for participation .  
With financial support from Germany , preparatory work is already under way on a high-impact programme for entrepreneurship development among women , under which 10 national programmes will be elaborated , each aimed at releasing the principal technical , managerial , financial , institutional and policy constraints affecting the development of women 's entrepreneurship .  
In its resolution 47 / 180 of 22 December 1992 , the General Assembly , concerned that people 's living environments were deteriorating and in urgent need of concerted international attention , decided to convene the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in 1996 and to establish a preparatory committee for the Conference , and requested the Secretary-General to establish an ad hoc secretariat for the Conference .  
Also decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs . " 
It had been agreed , in the preliminary exchanges of views , that the Working Group 's visit could with advantage be preceded by a preparatory visit so that , firstly , the Group could more easily take cognizance of certain constraints , political or technical ( for example the problem of distances ) , facing such a visit and to have a better understanding of Chinese law , in particular with regard to the difficulties entailed in bringing it into conformity with the international instruments on human rights .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
In order to gather specific information on preparations for the Year , United Nations Member States , United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , and selected non-governmental organizations were requested to provide information on the establishment of focal points for the Year and designate priorities for their preparatory activities within the four dimensions of the conceptual framework for the Year .  
At the informal consultations held on 15 January 1997 at a briefing by UNDCP for permanent missions to the United Nations ( Vienna ) , there was agreement that the bureau of the special segment ( preparatory body ) should be distinct from that of the regular segment ( functional commission ) and should remain in office until the special session .  
The input of the United Nations University ( UNU ) to the preparatory process included international conferences on world cities and urban future , and human settlements in the changing global political and economic processes .  
Following the precedent of the seventeenth special session , the preparatory body may wish to recommend that the vice-presidents of the upcoming special session should be the same as those of the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly , on the understanding that the regional groups may make substitutions of the vice-presidents allocated to each group .  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
The UNSCOM 168 team undertook preparatory work for the December political level talks which included interviews of personnel involved in the storage , movement and destruction , and in accounting of proscribed missile assets declared to have been secretly destroyed in 1991 .  
The Sudan is also ready and willing to participate in the preparatory meetings leading to the forthcoming Ottawa Conference , which will hopefully commit those countries which have expressed their readiness to accept some constraints on the kind of landmine that can be used or sold , taking into consideration paragraphs 69 and 70 of the section on Disarmament and international security of the Final Document adopted at the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non _ Aligned Countries held in New Delhi on 7 and 8 April 1997 . 
At its forty-fifth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1993 / 40 , decided to entrust Mr . Asbj \ x { 9de8 } n Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels , taking also into account matters related to the realization of the right to development , with a view to determining how most effectively to strengthen activities in this field .  
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
In this spirit , the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , deeply alarmed at the widening gap between the rich and the poor , adopted resolution 1993 / 40 in which it entrusted Mr . A . Eide with the task of producing a preparatory document on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , at both national and international levels .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
He confirmed that the UNCTAD initiative on trade was not limited to the new round of negotiations in services but that the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , in close cooperation with the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa , had planned joint activities for the preparation of the second WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in 1998 , including on issues related to trade and investment policy , trade and competition policy , transparency in government procurement and cooperation in organizing an Africa-wide conference preparatory to the Ministerial Conference .  
Because of the sharp annual increase in the elementary and preparatory school population , and the lack of funds to build new schools or classrooms to accommodate the additional pupils , the Agency resorted to renting buildings not originally designed as schools , or to operating some schools on double shifts - that is , two administrative schools in one building .  
That training is implemented in cooperation with the five education development centres , one in each Field , and covers a wide range of courses of one - , two - or three-year duration aimed at certifying unqualified elementary and preparatory teachers or vocational training instructors , meeting curricular changes and developing the supervisory and leadership skills of senior education staff .  
Requests all concerned organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the regional commissions and other relevant international and multilateral institutions , to make , within their respective fields of competence , substantive contributions and proposals for further action as submissions to the preparatory process of the Conference ;

Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
The Centre established a comprehensive data base on non-governmental organizations and other partners active in human settlements and is expanding its programme with those partners which had participated actively in the Habitat II preparatory process and had organized their own forums and presented their declarations and commitments to Committee II of the Conference . 11 .  At the present time , the main operational activity of the Centre in relation to the Global Strategy for Shelter , is the application of the urban and housing indicators .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Finally , the text reaffirms that the follow-up to the Summit will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the results of the major international conferences in the economic and social fields , and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the preparatory process for the special session benefits from the active involvement of all concerned and that the Secretariat is adequately supported so that it can assist in this process .

Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
With regard to the National Reconciliation Conference , a preparatory committee was established on 17 October 1997 , composed of 40 members representing the public authorities ( the Presidency of the Republic , the Government , the National Assembly and the judicial authorities ) , the parties of the four major political groups , trade unions , employers , the various professions ( lawyers , doctors , pharmacists , architects , notaries ) , religious denominations and women .  
Such support mainly involves the assignment of specialized staff to carry out preparatory tasks in a variety of areas , ranging from substantive issues to matters relating to the development of a working methodology and procedures , the preparation of a chronology for the period covered by the Commission 's work , and administrative and logistical matters , which include everything from the recruitment of support staff selected by the members of the Commission to the renting and refurbishing of office space .  
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
Based on the lessons drawn from those experiences , UNICEF had concentrated its activities , throughout the preparatory process for Habitat II and during the Conference itself , on putting children at the centre of the concerns of Habitat II , identifying poverty as the main cause of ill health in urban children , developing policies that led to a better distribution of the fruits of economic growth , reaffirming housing rights and defending the role of cities in guaranteeing the well-being of their inhabitants and not merely economic growth . 
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .  
We look forward to participating actively and constructively at the coming preparatory meeting for the 2000 Review Conference , which in our view should recoup the ground lost at previous meetings and resume the positive spirit and substantive role with which the strengthened review process started in 1995 .

In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
Regrettably , in view of the complexity of the subject and the diversity of views on some contentious issues , the preparatory committee has not been able to finalize its work on the main substantive document for the special session , and has decided to recommend that the General Assembly at its fifty-third session authorize the Commission on Population and Development acting as the preparatory committee to hold a resumed session for four days in May or June 1999 in order to complete its work .
