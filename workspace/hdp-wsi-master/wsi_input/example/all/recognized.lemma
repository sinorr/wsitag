Kerry , a Vietnam veteran with shining military exploits , is able to be selected as the Democratic presidential nominee , mainly because he is recognized as the candidate with the greatest chance to challenge Bush on the issue of national security .  
What is worthy of attention is that because the proposition on " Taiwan independence " has never been accepted by the majority of the Taiwan people , those who have adhered to " Taiwan independence , " have , out of current political needs , asserted that " Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country , " and Taiwan has never been recognized as a part of China 's territory .  
She even brazenly denied the common knowledge , universally recognized by the international community and known even to women and children , that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times , and is still talking about seeking " substantive diplomacy " in the " joint rule of two sexes . "  Is she not asking the people of Taiwan to ride a horse blindfolded and approach the deep pond in the middle of the night ?  
Whether it is in terms of blood relationship and geographical ties , or tradition or culture , the two sides of the strait are an inseparable entity , which has been universally recognized by the international community and a common understanding of all the Chinese descendants at home and abroad .  
In light of the " three represents " requirements , party committees at and above the army level fully recognized the extremely great importance of changing the leadership style and getting involved with the masses .  They paid special attention to overcoming superficial work style , formalism , and failure to go down to the grassroots , stay there , and provide concrete assistance to the masses .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
The reason why our party can win sincere support from the masses of people and pool and convert the will of hundreds of millions of people into a tremendous force for transforming the world and promoting the advance of history is that our party has always advocated and persisted in seeking truth from facts , and has sought and upheld the truth , recognized and corrected mistakes for the sake of people 's interests .  Our party is open and straightforward , upright and without any concealment and cheating .  
The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .  In fact , relevant authorities in Taiwan had earlier planned to adopt this system .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
As for why I should attach such great importance to the water shortage , I might as well list a series of statistical figures : Per capita water resources in China as a whole currently stand at less than 300 cubic meters , one eighth of the national average or one thirtieth of the world 's average , and much lower than the internationally recognized minimum water standard of 1,000 cubic meters each person .  
On the frequent high-level meetings between China and Russia , Zhu Bangzao said : The strategic cooperative partnership that is continuing to develop between China and Russia is based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the universally recognized norms of international law ; it is a new type of state-to-state relationship that is characterized by non-alignment and non-confrontation and is not targeted at a third country .  
At this year 's " two sessions , " the government has proposed that " full consideration should be given to the people 's capability of adapting themselves to the reform while carrying out reforms , and the expenses originally borne by the state and social institutions can not be shifted to the people . "  The government has also emphasized that the basic living standards of the disadvantaged people should be guaranteed , and a social security system should be established and improved .  NPC deputies and CPPCC members have recognized this .  
It is rather ignorant of history and the current situation and quite arrogant for Chen Shui-bian to sell the old stuff in 2000 .  This is of no help for easing up the tense situation across the strait .  The Chinese people have waged a struggle against the US theory asserting that " Taiwan 's status is not yet settled " for more than four decades and the US ultimately recognized that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and there is only one China in the world ;  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .  
Even though they do their utmost to play crafty tricks , saying that the two sides of the strait are two states and saying in another way round that the two sides of the strait can form a confederation or a compound state in the form of two sovereign states , this argument is not tenable in terms of legal principle and will not be recognized by the international community .

He said : The Chinese people cherish friendly feelings toward the Croatian people .  When your country declared independence in 1991 , China rapidly recognized it and established diplomatic relations with it in 1992 .  This was a decision made by the Chinese Government pursuant to its independent foreign policy of peace and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
People have also noticed that all the six countries Li Peng has visited have invariably reiterated that they support the principle of One China and hope to see China 's complete reunification be realized on an earlier date .  They have also made it clear that they will develop no official relations with Taiwan . This shows that the Chinese Government 's principle of safeguarding national reunification has been recognized by the international community at large .  
Taiwan says that the " National Reunification Council " is an advisory group that was set up under " the existing reunification consensus , " while the " Supra-Party Group Conference " " has recognized that the ( one-China ) consensus was subject to problems and even antagonism , so has jointly faced up to the future by setting up a mechanism to unite and congeal the views of both ruling and opposition parties , to rebuild the consensus . "

They point out that continual talks will be held between China and Russia and between China and Tajikistan on thoroughly solving the remaining border issues as quickly as possible on the basis of the current border treaties according to the universally recognized norms of international law , through negotiation on an equal footing and in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation .  
A new international political and economic order should be based itself upon the universally recognized norms governing international relations , meet the need of the development and progress of our times and reflect the spirit of peace and equality .  It should ensure that all countries , regardless of their size , wealth and strength , are all equal members of the international community .  
Since the new leader of Taiwan assumed office , he has never recognized the one-China principle , opposing reunification overtly and pursuing " independence " covertly , totally devoid of sincerity in improving cross-strait relations .  As a result , cross-strait relations continue to remain tense and a political crisis cropped up .  This is an even more serious background and deeper cause for the failure of his cabinet .  
3 .  Both sides stress the importance of exchanging views on international and regional issues of common concern , and express the willingness to promote bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation .

Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized .

In the Midrand Declaration , 7 member States of the Conference stated that it should be recognized that countries entered the new rules-based system of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) from very different starting points ; that , accordingly , the impact of globalization and liberalization was uneven ; and that the least developed countries , particularly those in Africa , remained constrained by weak supply capabilities and were unable to benefit from trade .

The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
It was unfortunate that a few countries refused to acknowledge that the issue had been settled once and for all by resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , and that the General Committee was subjected every year to the same repetitious and wasteful debate on the subject , despite the universally accepted principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State duly recognized as such by the United Nations . 
That lack left the door open to different interpretations even of such generally recognized principles as the sovereign equality of States , non-discrimination , non-interference , negotiation in good faith , cooperation between States and the non-use of force , and experience showed how changing the agreed or implied rules of negotiation or backtracking on previous agreements complicated subsequent negotiations .

The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .

The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .

The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
The United Nations , as a special and irreplaceable place for 185 States to meet , work together and cooperate , must lay down rules of law recognized universally by all so that international relations can continue in a coherent , equitable and efficient manner .

The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .

While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,

I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
Some were of the opinion that there has not yet been sufficient support in space law to conclude that a right of passage for ascending or descending space objects has been recognized as a rule of customary international law , but that in practice , such passage occurred without protest , and that as long as the passage was innocent and not prejudicial to the peace and security of subjacent States , then it could serve as the basis for the legalization of the actual practice .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .

As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .

Thus the principal question in the present context is what measures might be taken in order to facilitate achievement of the oft-confirmed goal of universal ratification of the six core treaties ?  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .

However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .

Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .

While we fully understand the desire of the Member States and the Secretariat of the United Nations to save funds by reducing the number and the size of its documents , it has been always recognized that this general 32-page limit can not be applied to thematic mechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights , the annual reports of which should adequately reflect the situation of gross and systematic human rights violations on a country-by-country basis throughout the world .

Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) said that the potential development impact of TCDC for developing countries was increasingly being recognized , since South-South cooperation was essential as a means of sharing relevant development experiences , his delegation welcomed the leading role increasingly being taken by developing countries themselves in initiating , organizing and financing TCDC activities , since national ownership and commitment were crucial to the success of South-South cooperation .

The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Any person may take quick , expedient action to protect himself , as long as no other more appropriate judicial means exist , against any immediate or potential act or omission of public authorities or any individuals , harming , restricting , altering or threatening rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution , by a treaty or by a law , in either an arbitrary or a manifestly illegal manner . . . .  
The effective functioning of the justice system and , in particular , the independence of the judiciary have been seriously undermined by several factors , including military intimidation , political pressure , very low salaries and a limited level of legal training of the judges and prosecutors , publicly recognized corruption of the judicial personnel , and article 51 of the Civil Servants Act .  
The Convention is recognized as the first truly verifiable global disarmament accord , with a unique , comprehensive and effective verification regime covering both military and industrial facilities .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Inter-clan fighting , lawlessness and the absence of a recognized national government remained major factors hindering the flow of humanitarian assistance , slowing the pace of recovery in more stable regions and threatening a recurrence of crisis conditions in others .  
In its resolution 51 / 185 , the Assembly recognized the paramount importance of a well-structured and coherent process towards the conclusion of the Decade , and requested proposals concerning the shape and form of natural disaster reduction activities in the twenty-first century and regarding the format , substance and timing of a closing event for the Decade with a view to enabling a forceful launching of the preparatory process as early as possible in 1998 .

Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the human rights treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;

Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Again urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees , to cease all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , to close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres , and to ensure that all accused persons are held in ordinary police or prison custody where family members and lawyers can visit them , and that such persons receive prompt , just and fair trials under internationally recognized standards ;

A substantial proportion of maternal deaths , approximately 13 per cent , result from complications associated with unsafe abortion . 4 The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development has recognized unsafe abortion to be a major public-health issue and recommended that the recourse to abortion be reduced through expanded and improved family planning services . 
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
The Committee noted that while there are a large number of thematic and related mechanisms dealing with different aspects of civil and political rights , there is none dealing solely with the economic , social and cultural rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , despite the acknowledged interdependence , indivisibility and interrelatedness of the two sets of rights ( E / 1997 / 22 _ E / CN . 12 / 1996 / 6 , para .  390 ) .  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
The United Nations , as a special and irreplaceable place for 185 States to meet , work together and cooperate , must lay down rules of law recognized universally by all so that international relations can continue in a coherent , equitable and efficient manner .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall fully respect the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States , as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law , and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognized by the United Nations .  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
I also consider it important to note that , at its substantive session of 1995 , the Economic and Social Council approved the report of the Commission on Sustainable Development on the work of its third session , in which , in its discussion of progress in implementing Agenda 21 , the Commission recognized that mountain ecosystems and environments are of crucial importance as rich and unique centres of biological and cultural diversity , water stores and sources of minerals . 
Recalls , with regard to the election of the members of the treaty bodies , the importance of giving consideration to equitable geographic distribution of membership and to the representation of the principal legal systems , and of bearing in mind that the members shall be elected and shall serve in their personal capacity and be of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights ;  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
Some were of the opinion that there has not yet been sufficient support in space law to conclude that a right of passage for ascending or descending space objects has been recognized as a rule of customary international law , but that in practice , such passage occurred without protest , and that as long as the passage was innocent and not prejudicial to the peace and security of subjacent States , then it could serve as the basis for the legalization of the actual practice .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
As the embodiment of the world community 's conscience and the sole recognized multilateral negotiating forum on disarmament , this Conference not only shoulders the primary responsibility for finding ways and means to really deal with the problem , but is also the most appropriate venue to commence the negotiations on a universal , effectively verifiable and legally binding multilateral treaty regulating the development , production , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction .  
As the distinction was difficult to apply in practice , the Commission should in the future base its work on any given topic on international conventions and custom and the recognized principles of law and should then proceed to consider what contributions to progressive development might be acceptable to the international community .  
Replace the first sentence with the following : At the ninth session of UNCTAD , Governments recognized that development had evolved from a narrow focus on economic growth and capital accumulation to a multidimensional process , with the ultimate goal of bettering the human condition .

Everyone has the right [ is entitled ] , individually and in association with others , to solicit , receive and utilize voluntary financial or other contributions , for the purpose of promoting and protecting , through peaceful means , [ universally recognized ] human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .  Thus the principal question in the present context is what measures might be taken in order to facilitate achievement of the oft-confirmed goal of universal ratification of the six core treaties ?  
The Convention on the Rights of the Child being a point of departure to guarantee child rights ; taking into consideration the progressive character of the implementation of certain social , economic and cultural rights as recognized in article 4 of the Convention , the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland would undertake the implementation of the right to free primary education to the maximum extent of available resources and expects to obtain the cooperation of the international community for its full satisfaction as soon as possible .

However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .

The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .  
The Committee also suggests that a multidisciplinary monitoring and coordinating system be established to assess the progress achieved and difficulties encountered in the realization of the rights recognized by the Convention at the national and local levels , paying particular attention to the adverse effects of economic policies on children .  
The High Contracting Parties shall base their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect , sovereign equality , territorial integrity , the inviolability of borders , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of pressure , the right of peoples to control their own destiny , non-interference in internal affairs , observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , cooperation among States , and conscientious fulfilment of international obligations and other universally recognized norms of international law .

All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
They shall abide strictly by the principles of mutual respect for their State sovereignty and independence , equality and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , non-use of force or threat of force , including economic and other means of exerting pressure , territorial integrity , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , conscientious fulfilment of their obligations , and other universally recognized norms of international law .

The international conferences of the 1990s recognized the crucial role of the private sector , together with other actors of civil society , in achieving goals of economic , social and environmentally sound development .  
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .
