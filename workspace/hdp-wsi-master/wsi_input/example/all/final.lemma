But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
A thorough review of the final documents of recent international conferences clearly illustrates that , notwithstanding the conceptual and normative transformations which the international community has undergone in the formulation and expression of its concerns and recommendations , it has legitimately stood firm on the need to respect the fundamental principles that preserve the very fabric of our diverse and pluralistic world .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
Regional cooperation is a goal which we all seek , but it must be the result of the achievement of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , including the resolution of the final status issues , as provided for in the Declaration of Principles . We believe that this goal should be reached gradually , moving parallel to the political developments achieved and supporting them , not preceding them .  
I wish to express the hope that the practical implementation of this document will contribute to the continuation of the negotiating process towards the final settlement of the problem by political means and to the establishment of lasting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East , and will serve the cause of the Palestinian people 's exercise of its right to national self-determination through the creation of an independent State of Palestine .  
At all three sessions , the Assembly while expressing its absolute support for the ongoing peace process , has emphasized its principles stand , based on the Charter and international law , with regard to the elements of the final settlement of the Palestinian question nd to the necessity of enabling the Palestinian people to attain its inalienable rights .  
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
Emphasis should be placed on improving basic data in those series necessary for compiling the major aggregates of the 1993 SNA for the total economy , including estimates of value added by kind of activity and final expenditures on gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices ; gross national income ; gross disposable income ; savings ; and net lending .  
Sometimes this means that certain conflicts whose threat to international stability is not obvious swallow up considerable funds , with large contingents of peace-keeping forces being sent immediately , whereas in other instances we believe the Security Council is slow to act , sometimes taking months to study a situation and limiting itself in the final analysis to sending small groups of observers , despite the direct request made by the leaders of the States concerned .  
The attainment of that goal meant the final elimination of nuclear weapons , since the existence of such weapons still constituted a serious threat to the main purpose of the United Nations - the maintenance of international peace and security .  36 .  In the view of his delegation , there were three available options for extending the Treaty : it could be extended for an indefinite period , for an additional fixed period , or for several successive periods .  
Such an assessment was confirmed by the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that the human rights of women and of the girl child were an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights ; that they should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities and be regularly and systematically addressed . 
Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone . 
Recalling the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including its most recent resolution , 1994 / 74 of 9 March 1994 , [ 4 ] / in which the Commission decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-first session ,

Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .

The United Nations must never again permit itself to be reduced to a passive observer or , even worse , an obedient assistant to the Pale regime in their final act of ethnic cleansing .  
The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support .

Following on the plenary meeting , in a meeting devoted to Iraq 's biological weapons programme , Iraq for the first time disclosed a much more extensive programme than that contained in its full , final and complete disclosure of early August 1995 , admitting weaponization immediately prior to the outbreak of the Gulf war , including the filling of biological warfare agents into 166 bombs and 25 Al Hussein missile warheads .  
Another concerned the proposed function of the International Court of Justice : assuming that it continued to operate in its current manner , was the Court suited to make the final decision with regard to the existence of an international crime and would it be able to respond quickly enough to an international crime which was being committed by a State ?

Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 23 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
further the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including the most recent , resolution 1995 / 76 of 8 March 1995 , [ 31 ] / by which the Commission extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-second session ,  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;

In this context , we hope that Iraq will create the conditions and climate necessary for achieving this objective , through full cooperation with the Special Commission established to supervise the elimination of all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and through the provision , at the earliest possible date , of complete , comprehensive and final information on all elements of its proscribed programmes .  
For the sole reason that it was a colony of the Japanese imperialists , Korea was included in the operational zone of the Allied forces at the final stage of the Second World War , when the United States of America " persuaded " the then Soviet Union that " the United States forces should participate in disarming the Japanese forces stationed in Korea " , and thereby divided Korea along the 38th parallel of north latitude " temporarily " , placing the northern part of Korea under Soviet responsibility and the southern part under United States responsibility .

Table 2 shows that 32,483 work-months , that is 62 per cent of the total work-months utilized , were committed for the implementation of activities that generate final outputs under the major categories of parliamentary services , published material and information services . 
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue .

It recently took concrete form , as everyone knows , through the freezing of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron , the refusal to resume negotiations on the final situation in the occupied Palestinian territories , the return to the policy of settlements , the blocking off of the Palestinian territories , the confiscation of Arab lands and the collective economic sanctions and daily acts of violence against the unarmed civilian population .

Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .

Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .

To question the reservations procedure designed in the Vienna regime would , far from promoting the universality of treaties , result in an excessive restriction on the admissibility of reservations , the free consent of the parties , and the supplementary nature of reservations , which , in the final analysis , was an expression of the same will of States that was reflected in a balanced way in the literal text of the treaties .

As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
In a world of constant change that does not allow for static and rigid criteria and practices , the Commission needs to have under continuous observation these fluctuating and interconnecting scenarios in order to anticipate their evolution and the adjustments that they could require , if the Commission is to reach its final goals and to leave a legacy of realistic and tangible achievements .  
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .

Jos Bengoa , ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
In its decision 1996 / 119 , the Sub _ Commission , having considered that report decided to request the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its forty _ ninth session a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity contained in annex II of the final report , taking into account the comments and observations received .  
The Sub-Commission , at its forty-eighth session , in its resolution 1996 / 30 , requested the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States which have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency with a view to its consideration by the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session , and requested him to submit final conclusions on the protection of human rights during states of emergency , together with specific recommendations as to how this question should be dealt with in the future .  
The final objective of the report is to signal the challenges to the human rights system posed by the process of globalization , especially in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Similar reconvened sessions should in future be held in December of odd years to approve the initial programme budget for the following biennium and the final version of the programme budget for the biennium that is drawing to a close , and to deal with any related administrative or budgetary matters . 
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations . 
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations . 
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
The Economic and Social Council also decided that similar reconvened sessions should in future be held in December of odd years to approve the initial programme budget for the following biennium and the final version of the programme budget for the biennium that is drawing to a close , and to deal with any related administrative or budgetary matters .  * E / CN . 7 / 1997 / 1 .  
In a letter dated 24 July 1997 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule on implementation of the Abuja Agreement ( S / 1995 / 742 , annex ) .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
The efficient work of the IDNDR national committees of France , Germany and the United Kingdom must be commended , especially in relation to the planning and organization of relevant central events of the final phase of the Decade , such as the conference on early warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters scheduled to take place at Potsdam , Germany , in 1998 ;  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
In the final days of the regular session the General Assembly and the presidency responded effectively and played an impartial and constructive role in selecting a Secretary-General when assertive unilateralism provoked deadlock in the Security Council and threatened to undermine the integrity of the institution of the United Nations itself .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
The risk of trafficking organizations being detected as a result of seizures can also be lowered by using large numbers of unskilled and cheap couriers to forward relatively small amounts of heroin and cocaine within regions or through transit regions that are not too distant from the final destination and less suspicious to enforcement agencies than the known source countries .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
With regard to project activities , the Committee was informed that a reserve is maintained for each project in accordance with United Nations administrative instructions ( ST / AI / 285 ) for technical cooperation trust funds , which stipulates in Part IV , B , that " a cash reserve at the level of 15 per cent of the annual estimated expenditures " is to be maintained during the implementation of the trust fund activities to cover eventual shortfalls and will be utilized to meet the final expenditure of the trust fund , including liquidating liabilities .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
With regard to new article W , the representative of Germany stated that his delegation placed mental brackets on the adoption by consensus of new article W .

In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
At least at the current stage of the Commissions work on the topic , the functional protection extended by international organizations towards their agents should be considered along with diplomatic protection per se , since the initial results would supply the clarification needed for the subsequent adoption of a final decision on the inclusion of functional protection .  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .  
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
IACWGE has taken steps to ensure that the outputs of the task forces , such as their final reports or the guidelines for resident representatives , fully reflect a gender perspective , including direct or indirect participation in the discussions of case studies at the country level ( see ACC / 1996 / 22 , para . 31 ) ( see also the report of ACC on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up to the major United Nations conferences and summits ( E / 1997 / ) ) . 
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .  
The argument put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army militia is responsible for the detention camp of Khiam , is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility , since Israel is the occupying power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies .  
As of 30 June , the office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson had opened 1,692 provisional files , registered 713 cases , issued 10 final reports in individual cases and eight special reports ; 38 requests for interim measures have been successful , and 21 have not been implemented by the authorities . 
An election implementation plan was agreed between the OSCE Mission and my Office based on the principles that implementation of the election result are : the responsibility of the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities ; an integral part of the electoral process and , therefore , will be firmly anchored in the rules and regulations ; certified in a two-step process ensuring that final certification is not issued before the successful installation of municipal councils has taken place .  
Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
The final document of the Bucharest meeting contained specific recommendations on organizing national consultative processes involving civil society with a view to elaborating and implementing national plans , integrating activities designed to strengthen national structures working for the advancement of women within the context of administrative reform , establishing cooperation mechanisms between governments and non-governmental organizations , and conducting research and gathering statistical data on the role of women in society .  
Despite the decision pursuant to the peace accords signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel to postpone discussion of certain items , including the matter of settlements , pending negotiations on final status , the illegal confiscation of Arab lands by the Israeli Government in order to build settlements was incompatible with the achievement by all parties of the common goal of economic and social stability .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
Requests the Commission , at its seventh session , to finalize the programme for the Tenth Congress and to make its final recommendations , through the Economic and Social Council , to the General Assembly , taking into account that the Tenth Congress should deal with a limited number of precisely defined substantive topics reflecting the urgent needs of the world community and include practical technical workshops on well-focused issues related to the substantive agenda items ;  
The Economic and Social Council also decided that similar reconvened sessions should in future be held in December of odd years to approve the initial programme budget for the following biennium and the final version of the programme budget for the biennium that is drawing to a close , and to deal with any related administrative or budgetary matters .

It is valid only until nuclear disarmament is achieved , and resolute , systematic and progressive efforts towards the final objective of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide are of crucial importance to it .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia considers that this vital issue for Republika Srpska should be settled in a principled manner , by strict compliance with the Dayton / Paris agreement and respect for the legitimate interests of Republika Srpska , which is an essential prerequisite for final success of the Dayton / Paris peace agreement .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this current offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of the current offensive contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it .  
The fact that Ethiopia started this offensive and violated the United States-brokered moratorium on air attacks has been contrary to its useless but usual attempt to deny it , ascertained by all those who have followed and witnessed its final preparations and the actual launch and conduct of its current offensive .  
Requests the regional preparatory meetings to present to the Preparatory Committee , through the High Commissioner , reports on the results of their deliberations , with concrete and pragmatic recommendations aimed at combating racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , which will be duly reflected in the texts of the draft final documents of the World Conference , to be prepared by the Committee ;  
In the final phase , a global strategy against trafficking in human beings will be formulated in close consultation with relevant national and international organizations and presented for adoption by the international community , possibly at a high-level forum .

In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
His delegation was convinced that the final text must meet at least two conditions : it must result in a consistent and well _ organized instrument , which did not duplicate existing international instruments or those under discussion in other forums ; it must be effective , which meant that it must enable States to act effectively against the scourges with which the protocol dealt .  
The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .  
The Rio Group therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a comprehensive and final settlement with a view to re-establishing a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups and minorities in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .

In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the working group , in order to continue its work , to meet prior to the fifty _ sixth session of the Commission for a period of two weeks , with a view to completing expeditiously a final and substantive text , and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ sixth session .  
It was agreed that the Bureau would consult with representatives of Member States in New York on the theme proposed by the Group of 77 and China entitled " The role of technical cooperation among developing countries in science and technology for development " and that a final decision based on those consultations would be communicated to the Member States well ahead of the twelfth session so that delegations may take suitable preparatory actions .  
The first type is in terms of the gross output , based on its status and whether it is a final ( parliamentary services , published material , information materials and services , advisory services , training courses / seminars / workshops ) or an intermediate ( coordination , harmonization and liaison or international cooperation ) output .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its forty _ ninth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1997 / 107 taking note that it did not have sufficient time for a comprehensive discussion of the final report of the Special Rapporteur on income distribution and human rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 9 ) , decided to postpone to its fiftieth session the presentation by Mr .

The inherent nature of the colonial undertaking , the exploitative , discriminatory and dominating character of its philosophy as a system , the methods employed and the final results it had on very dissimilar societies mark the difference .  
It is not the task of the Special Rapporteur in this final report to describe in detail the harsh impact on indigenous peoples of being subjected to a new and totally alien social , economic , and political _ juridical order .  
The observer for Romania added that the problem of effective participation of political organizations of national minorities , and the recognition of minoritiy representatives in public affairs , should be included in the final document as an element of international preventive policy .  
A unilateral statement , however phrased or named , formulated by a State or an international organization after initialling or signature but prior to entry into force of a bilateral treaty , by which that State or that organization purports to obtain from the other party a modification of the provisions of the treaty to which it is subordinating the expression of its final consent to be bound , does not constitute a reservation within the meaning of the present Guide to practice .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
Ambassador Moher arrived four years ago , at a crucial time , when the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty were entering their final stage , and he injected into our deliberations a remarkable blend of deep knowledge of the issues under negotiation , an ingredient of iron _ clad logic and a special ability to build bridges between opposing views .  
Given the recognized and authentic relationship which exists between disarmament and development and because it is immoral and unacceptable to squander resources on armaments while the needs of billions of human beings so unsatisfied , the final document resulting from the first special session devoted to disarmament , held in 1978 , included various references to the question in its paragraphs 16 , 35 , 89 , 94 and 95 .  
The limits of the shelf established by a coastal State on the basis of these recommendations shall be final and binding .  9 .

In a letter dated 24 July 1997 to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1997 / 581 ) , the Secretary-General informed the Council of the successful completion of the electoral process in Liberia , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja agreement , which had been signed in August 1995 .  
At its 904th plenary meeting , on 15 October 1999 , the Trade and Development Board took note of the oral report of the representative of Uganda , speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the informal consultations on the subject in question , and decided to extend the mandate of the informal consultations with a view to receiving a report on the outcome of the consultations at its forty-sixth session . final sessions : 
The final status of the concerned territories will later be determined through delimitation and demarcation ( based on colonial treaties and applicable international law ) , processes that are completely separate from the restoration of the status quo ante .  
The meetings final document stressed the importance of the active involvement of indigenous peoples in the building of the country and in ensuring the stable development in the North of traditional and modern means of production , with protection of the inhabited environment .  
After intense negotiations and substantive progress in the definition of the text of the protocol , the meeting had been suspended without having achieved its final objective ; informal consultations had been held in Vienna the previous month , but no progress had been achieved .  
In 1992 , the member countries signed the Maastricht Treaty , agreeing to eliminate over 280 physical , technical , and fiscal barriers to the creation of a single market , and moved one step closer to the final stage of currency union .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
However , along with these common interests , the following point must be made clear : A democratic country like Israel can not accept a precondition to beginning the talks that requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the opposing side .  
Regardless of its considerable benefits , nuclear energy is still problematic in one particular aspect : spent fuel and nuclear waste , its interim storage and final repository , especially in small States with limited industrial and scientific capabilities .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban , South Africa , in September 1998 , as contained in the final document , which Namibia strongly supported . 
In this respect , we wish to recall the final document adopted at the Non-Aligned Movement summit held in Durban , South Africa , which expressed deep concern over the widening of , the extraterritorial nature of the embargo against Cuba and over continuous new legislative measures geared to intensifying it .  
Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
My delegation also wishes to express very special appreciation for the excellent work accomplished by the Counsel of the Brazilian Mission , Mrs . Marcela Nicodemos who for the third year in a row led the informal consultations that brought about the final text of this draft resolution in an effective , professional and expeditious manner .  
It is significant that throughout the political campaign leading to the first round of general elections , held just 12 days ago , and whose final outcome will be decided in the run-off scheduled for 26 December , each and every one of the political parties , without exception , expressed full support for the implementation of the peace agreements , as well as for the continued presence in Guatemala of the Verification Mission . Indeed , MINUGUA forms an integral part of those Agreements . 
But we must remember that it is a process : a series of steps which build upon each other so that the final result , which we firmly believe to be achievable , will have come about through gradual , careful and deliberate negotiation and not through imperfect solutions imposed from outside or as a consequence of inherent power imbalances or short-term political expediency .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .  
While joining this valuable consensus on the final outcome of the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly , on population and development , and supporting its implementation at both national and international levels , I would like to enter our reservation regarding any provision in the text that condones or encourages , explicitly or otherwise , sexual relations outside the framework of marriage and the family , as defined exclusively as the heterosexual union between man and woman .  
The productive and intensive work of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as preparatory body for the special session has enabled us to formulate a balanced , realistic and forward-looking draft final document , which will be a new and important step towards the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and towards the full realization of the objectives of Agenda 21 .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52-227 , requested the Secretary-General to include in his tenth progress report a detailed plan of action and information on the final level of resources needed to resolve all outstanding problems so as to make the system fully operational , taking into account , inter alia , the study by the independent experts .  
In the final paragraph of the text , regret was expressed that a comprehensive review of the issues raised in the three previous resolutions on the item had not been carried out and the Secretary-General was requested to undertake that review and report on its conduct and on the implementation of the current resolution addressing a range of structural and management issues , including those raised by the Advisory Committee . 
89 . At its fifty-fourth session , in resolution 1998-34 , the Commission requested the open-ended working group , in order to continue its work , to meet prior to the fifty-fifth session of the Commission for a period of two weeks , in the course of which the Chairman of the working group , in consultation with the members of the group , might request one additional week with a view to completing expeditiously a final and substantive text , and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
The final resolution of the Conference stated that it is crucial to ensure access to all relevant information for the public , to involve local and regional authorities and the public in decision _ making and to seek public confidence in principles that govern the safety of repositories and in waste management programmes ( for the proceedings of the Conference , see the Council of Europe series Studies and Texts , No . 57 ) .  
Secondly , some elements that were incorporated into the draft resolution are not in accordance with our own perception of nuclear disarmament , which is fully identified with the position of the Non-Aligned Movement as appropriately stated at its summit at Cartagena , Colombia , in an international setting that favoured the promotion of practical measures for the final and complete elimination of nuclear weapons .

Using the letters " HK " as a theme , the new smart ID card would incorporate sophisticated security features to make it very secure and fraud resistant .  
They were very happy to have the opportunity to observe the congress in session . They were particularly excited by the revolutionary stand of the Kuomintang in the adopted party platform , pledging itself to remain in the democratic camp , and to unite all the people 's strength from at home and abroad , as well as from behind the enemy lines , for the final victory of national recovery against the Communists .  
By the time they got to the final game they were exhausted , the pitchers had very little energy and the batters were almost incapable of swinging their bats . Moreover , New Zealand by virtue of being the Western champion earned a rest in the afternoon while the ROC battled Australia .  
This was the first of the " cursive " style of calligraphy , which was a free-flowing , less structured form of character script . This progression marked a radical departure from those first early pictographs which graced the oracle bones . The " standard " script marked the final evolution of formal writing , while a further evolution in the " cursive " style produced the " running " style of calligraphy .  
Under the imperial examination system , the friends and relatives of a scholar traveling to the capital to take the final examination would customarily present him with a duck as a farewell gift , because the Chinese character for duck contains the phonetic chia , meaning number one or first place . Hospitable innkeepers in the capital would cook pigs ' feet ( t'i ) for the candidates as a sign that their names would be listed ( t'i ) on the roll of successful candidates .  
Upon the decease of a parent , the mourners first erect a paper tabletas a temporary home for his spirit . Meanwhile a wooden tablet is prepared with the parent 's name and the conventional funerary inscription written on it , all except for the dot on top of the final character chu . This dot must be added by someone well acquainted with the deceased and of impeccable virtue , whereupon the paper tablet is incinerated .  
That he could return to his homeland was naturally some consolation to him in his final years , but it is still a pity that Eight Virtues Garden lost its owner and was expropriated so soon . The remaining rocks and trees were sold or stolen ; the gibbons and other rare animals were sent to the Sao Paolo zoo ; and Great Wind Hall was left ankle deep in exquisite Chinese paper and scrolls .  
The midterm and final report cards they handed over were Komalan Opera , a Taiwanese opera that tells the story of how the Han Chinese and the Pingpu aborigines a century ago changed from opposition to mutual acceptance , and Walking Theater , a stage play that centers around the life of a veteran Pei Kuan opera performer and thus contains a large amount of traditional singing , reciting and acting .  
The faces of Buddhist Statues are mass produced in plastic ; the frames for final resting places are carved by machines and are ragged ; and course paper is used for the ceremonial spirit house , " says Master Hsu , angry about the superficiality of the living . As for whether the place where the deceased reside in the afterlife will leak water or collapse , that is of course part of the gap between this and the other world , and there is nothing anyone can do about it .  
In other words , if I was spiritually unable to pass the test , and could not conquer the terror of dying , no matter what the final outcome I would have felt very ashamed . This would be like a businessman losing even his initial investment . This sense of shame more or less inspired me to believe that I had no choice but to overcome fear .  
The Ghostbusting Eight Generals " is Sinorama 's final installment in our series on Taiwan 's yi-chen . Our writer , with detailed graphs , exquisite pictures and intriguing text , has brought the past back to us who grew up in Taiwan 's little villages , reminding us of times we were squeezed among the grown-ups as we all watched the members of an " ghostbusting " procession , tall and short , faces covered with frightening paint .  
On main thoroughfares and in little lanes , in supermarkets , in record stores , in taxicabs . . . . everywhere you turn you can hear her sweet voice resonating : The singing has stopped Drink a final cup of wine I chat and talk of anything To ease your troubled mind Life has few opportunities for intoxication Why not look forward to them ?  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
In the past , people rushed to plant trees as short-term cash crops , but did not develop the economic potential of native trees , nor was there any long term plan for nursery raising and planting of native tree species . Today we must work hard to make up for this lacuna , otherwise if non-native species are planted as cash crops , the final result may be the same as with pine wilt disease : that we will benefit from neither the introduced nor our native species . Reshuffling the cards  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
Not conceding defeat , she filed a final appeal for a constitutional ruling . According to statistics in the yearbook of the Judicial Yuan , intentional abandonment is the most common grounds for divorce , accounting for more than half of all cases , many of which hinge upon the wife not living at her husband 's official residence .  
She adds , with particular reference to the problem of overtime pay , " It is especially unfair given that employer and employee interact as economic entities , a status in which every individual should be equal . " The final irony of all is that the overtime regulations are frequently not observed by employers , so the people who are punished most are those single women who obediently agree to work past the legal limits on their overtime hours .  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
As the fall of the Southern Tang loomed , Li remained unaware of just how near the enemy had drawn until the Song troops had Jinling totally encircled . In the end he walked out the city gates together with his ministers of state to proffer his final surrender wearing only a simple white gown , a stark symbol of surrender akin in Chinese culture to the act of running up a white flag .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures . But the problem was that children just had one way to succeed . What 's worth applauding about multiple-track admissions is that it lets children with different sets of strengths all have a chance to get ahead . "  
Fourth , they established organized systems of religious practice . Examples are clerics such as Hui Neng , sixth patriarch of Chan Buddhism , Master Xian Shou , who founded the Huayan Sect in the Tang dynasty , and Master Zhi Zhe , who enabled the Tiantai Sect to spread far and wide . A final characteristic of the most distinctive figures in Buddhism is that their stories were avidly related by later generations .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
Among them , Lin would not only have his works selected for ten Taiwan Exhibitions in a row , but he would also win the top prize at the fourth Taiwan Exhibition for Lotus Pool , second place at the sixth for Sugar Cane , and first prize again at the seventh exhibition for Sunset . Moreover , as a result of his accomplishments , beginning with the eighth exhibition he was granted the privilege of entering the final stage of competition directly .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
The final major focus is miniature fuel cells . We expect that by 2006 we can develop mobile phone batteries that will run for 50 days on standby , and notebook computer batteries that will run for 12 hours . When you go and sit in a cafe to write an urgent report and go online to find information via a wireless Internet connection , you wo n't have to worry about your computer running out of power .  
With the public in an uproar and politicians scrambling to distance themselves from corruption , the Legislative Yuan 's Home and Nations Committee completed its initial review of the political contributions law , and the ruling and opposition parties were expecting to get the bill through the third and final reading during the recently concluded legislative session .

Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
During the 80s , in conjunction with extensive land development , the capital costs of salt making and the quality of the final product made it impossible to compete with imported salt for market share . Furthermore , those willing to do the backbreaking work of exposing the salt to the sun were becoming harder to find .  
Although pressure for economic reform is gaining momentum in the international community , the PRC authorities see control of information as the final line of defense , and thus keep a tight grasp on it . However , this is already being put to the test by Western and Japanese companies , through running their own advertising fronts and licensing out their titles , staking their claims before the complete lifting of restrictions , and using their massive capital bases to secure their positions .  
In mid-June , Taipei City Councilor Liu Yao-jen declared at a press conference that he had bought on the Internet personal information on 1,200 primary and middle school students at NT $ 1 a pop from a " name list seller . " All of this data , most of which was on students in the final years of primary school in Sungshan and Hsinyi districts , had been burned onto a CD-ROM , and included the names of the students and their family members , their grade , telephone number , and address .  
In former times , the emperor had the final say in how urban spaces were organized , and all buildings took the imperial palace as their yardstick . In the democratic era , citizens have formed a close relationship with public spaces , giving them a key role .

But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
First , France has not announced its intention to continue its nuclear testing indefinitely ; on the contrary , we have stated our decision to complete it by engaging in a final series limited to a few tests , which will be concluded before 31 May 1996 .  
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
A thorough review of the final documents of recent international conferences clearly illustrates that , notwithstanding the conceptual and normative transformations which the international community has undergone in the formulation and expression of its concerns and recommendations , it has legitimately stood firm on the need to respect the fundamental principles that preserve the very fabric of our diverse and pluralistic world .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
May this final celebration of the United Nations Year for Tolerance therefore also serve as the occasion on which we call for the redoubling of our efforts to close the apparent divides between us and overcome our momentary differences , our ideological and cultural barriers .  Let all of us therefore continue together , well beyond this special year , to work within the United Nations to instil the spirit of tolerance in the heart of the human community ( SG / SM / 5814 ) .  
Regional cooperation is a goal which we all seek , but it must be the result of the achievement of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , including the resolution of the final status issues , as provided for in the Declaration of Principles . We believe that this goal should be reached gradually , moving parallel to the political developments achieved and supporting them , not preceding them .  
I wish to express the hope that the practical implementation of this document will contribute to the continuation of the negotiating process towards the final settlement of the problem by political means and to the establishment of lasting peace and mutual understanding in the Middle East , and will serve the cause of the Palestinian people 's exercise of its right to national self-determination through the creation of an independent State of Palestine .  
At all three sessions , the Assembly while expressing its absolute support for the ongoing peace process , has emphasized its principles stand , based on the Charter and international law , with regard to the elements of the final settlement of the Palestinian question nd to the necessity of enabling the Palestinian people to attain its inalienable rights .  
I am fully aware that the task is a daunting one because of the fundamental divergence of views that exist within the Conference on the international arms-control and disarmament agenda in the post-cold-war era and following the indefinite extension of the NPT and , in the final analysis , on the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum at this crucial juncture .  
Emphasis should be placed on improving basic data in those series necessary for compiling the major aggregates of the 1993 SNA for the total economy , including estimates of value added by kind of activity and final expenditures on gross domestic product ( GDP ) at current and constant prices ; gross national income ; gross disposable income ; savings ; and net lending .  
Sometimes this means that certain conflicts whose threat to international stability is not obvious swallow up considerable funds , with large contingents of peace-keeping forces being sent immediately , whereas in other instances we believe the Security Council is slow to act , sometimes taking months to study a situation and limiting itself in the final analysis to sending small groups of observers , despite the direct request made by the leaders of the States concerned .  
The attainment of that goal meant the final elimination of nuclear weapons , since the existence of such weapons still constituted a serious threat to the main purpose of the United Nations - the maintenance of international peace and security .  36 .  In the view of his delegation , there were three available options for extending the Treaty : it could be extended for an indefinite period , for an additional fixed period , or for several successive periods .  
Such an assessment was confirmed by the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that the human rights of women and of the girl child were an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights ; that they should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities and be regularly and systematically addressed . 
Our efforts have helped develop a text that , in its final version , makes no mention of Chapter VII of the Charter , addresses requests to States that are not binding in nature and specifies that any detentions will be effected in accordance with their national law which , in our view , means that only those States that have domestic legislation enabling them to act along the requested lines will be able to do so , as the resolution can not serve by itself alone as a legal basis for arresting anyone . 
Recalling the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including its most recent resolution , 1994 / 74 of 9 March 1994 , [ 4 ] / in which the Commission decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-first session ,

Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .

The United Nations must never again permit itself to be reduced to a passive observer or , even worse , an obedient assistant to the Pale regime in their final act of ethnic cleansing .  
The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support . 
Comparisons of findings with written texts and subsequent modifications to the texts based on the students ' individual and collective experiences with the actual situations not only encourage reality-based interaction with those outside the school environment , but also encourage students to treat texts as modifiable entities instead of final authorities .

Another concerned the proposed function of the International Court of Justice : assuming that it continued to operate in its current manner , was the Court suited to make the final decision with regard to the existence of an international crime and would it be able to respond quickly enough to an international crime which was being committed by a State ?

Encourages the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to request the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 23 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-second session ;  
further the pertinent resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , including the most recent , resolution 1995 / 76 of 8 March 1995 , [ 31 ] / by which the Commission extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a further year and requested him to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and a final report to the Commission at its fifty-second session ,  
We must face up to terrorism and muster the national will to work collectively on a global level to stamp out the root causes of this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong , the poor and the rich , for , in the final analysis , terrorism is not susceptible to reason ; it stems from bigotry , traumatizes the innocent , resorts to violence and seeks no dialogue .  
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
Given the new challenges of these final years of our millennium , the International Court of Justice today , half a century after its founding , has become the body to which States , both large and small , and international organizations are turning increasingly to seek justice or to request the Court 's authoritative opinion on disputes , differences or legal problems that arise or create differences between them , convinced that the only valid and lasting solution is one based on law .  
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .  
Therefore , any action taken by Israel since the beginning of the Madrid process to alter the political , legal or demographic status of Jerusalem is tantamount to creating a fait accompli to be imposed on the Arab party , which would constitute a judgement on the status of the Holy City before the beginning of the final status negotiations .  This is unacceptable and can not be conducive to the peace we all desire .  
Thus the Government of Jordan , in order to maintain the Holy City 's special religious , cultural and historic character , has taken a strong interest in continuing its custodianship of the holy places so as to protect them from all dangers until the desired final status is achieved .  
Welcomes with special satisfaction the adoption by the African leaders of the final text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty ( the Pelindaba Treaty ) , 5 / which constitutes an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security and which , at the same time , recognizes the right of African countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples ;

The Committee had played a vital role in promoting economic , social and cultural rights , by formulating final views on the way in which States had fulfilled their Covenant obligations , by defining its General Comments as a basis for jurisprudence in that area , by discussing the question of the elaboration of an optional protocol to the Covenant that would allow individuals and groups to present legal complaints with regard to the violation of one or several of the rights protected by the Covenant , and by successfully conducting its first technical assistance mission .  
Also decides that the field-level committees organized by the United Nations system country team , which were established in accordance with paragraph 40 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 , should review substantive activities - including draft country programmes , sectoral programmes and projects - prior to their approval by individual organizations , and should exchange experience acquired , on the understanding that the result of the work of the review committee should be submitted to national Governments for final approval through the national focal points ;

In this context , we hope that Iraq will create the conditions and climate necessary for achieving this objective , through full cooperation with the Special Commission established to supervise the elimination of all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and through the provision , at the earliest possible date , of complete , comprehensive and final information on all elements of its proscribed programmes .  
For the sole reason that it was a colony of the Japanese imperialists , Korea was included in the operational zone of the Allied forces at the final stage of the Second World War , when the United States of America " persuaded " the then Soviet Union that " the United States forces should participate in disarming the Japanese forces stationed in Korea " , and thereby divided Korea along the 38th parallel of north latitude " temporarily " , placing the northern part of Korea under Soviet responsibility and the southern part under United States responsibility .  
In the final statement of the Summit , the two Presidents , laid out several steps designed to achieve three essential objectives : supporting the Israeli-Palestinian agreements ; supporting continuing negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement ; and working together to promote security and stability in the region through effective means , cooperation and further assistance .  
Table 2 shows that 32,483 work-months , that is 62 per cent of the total work-months utilized , were committed for the implementation of activities that generate final outputs under the major categories of parliamentary services , published material and information services . 
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
At the same time , we are pleased to note that the members of the Security Council have been able to resist the temptation to use threatening language and an approach based on force , which could only have complicated the work of the Special Commission and in the final analysis made it more difficult to achieve the major goal set out in Security Council resolutions : a lasting post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf .  
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue .

Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
Yemen reaffirms the need to move quickly towards a final settlement of the question of Palestine that will allow the Palestinian people to attain their legitimate rights , especially their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital , in keeping with international law and with the fundamental principles established at the Madrid Conference and in the Oslo and subsequent agreements .  
Since Israel 's occupation of East Jerusalem , more than 28 years ago , the Israeli Government has tried to judaize the city by distorting its identity , changing its demographic character , deporting Palestinian inhabitants and reducing their numbers through the application of military , administrative and legal measures , moving settlers into the city and expanding Jerusalem 's borders to prejudice the final status of the city .

To question the reservations procedure designed in the Vienna regime would , far from promoting the universality of treaties , result in an excessive restriction on the admissibility of reservations , the free consent of the parties , and the supplementary nature of reservations , which , in the final analysis , was an expression of the same will of States that was reflected in a balanced way in the literal text of the treaties .

We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
We believe , and it was also indicated in the discussions and the final declaration of the conference , that the Tehran conference provided a unique opportunity for participants to express their collective support for the ongoing peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and to send a strong signal to the warring factions in Afghanistan that the countries in the region totally reject the vicious circle of war and violence in Afghanistan .

For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
In a world of constant change that does not allow for static and rigid criteria and practices , the Commission needs to have under continuous observation these fluctuating and interconnecting scenarios in order to anticipate their evolution and the adjustments that they could require , if the Commission is to reach its final goals and to leave a legacy of realistic and tangible achievements .  
I am firmly convinced that with the final fine tuning of these ultimate requirements , this United Nations compensation operation will pass into history as a model of effectiveness , correction and fairness in the delicate and difficult circumstances that led to its creation , and that its work , its rules and its results will guide and shape the outcome of future compensation operations .

The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
The efficient work of the IDNDR national committees of France , Germany and the United Kingdom must be commended , especially in relation to the planning and organization of relevant central events of the final phase of the Decade , such as the conference on early warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters scheduled to take place at Potsdam , Germany , in 1998 ;

In the final days of the regular session the General Assembly and the presidency responded effectively and played an impartial and constructive role in selecting a Secretary-General when assertive unilateralism provoked deadlock in the Security Council and threatened to undermine the integrity of the institution of the United Nations itself .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
This could well be the real meaning of democracy : constant improvement in living conditions and moving from one level to another through successive Governments with the free vote of the people being the final judge of what is to be done .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community .

The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .

At least at the current stage of the Commissions work on the topic , the functional protection extended by international organizations towards their agents should be considered along with diplomatic protection per se , since the initial results would supply the clarification needed for the subsequent adoption of a final decision on the inclusion of functional protection .  
It also was necessary to exclude international juridical events , such as various notifications which did not entail an intention on the part of the author to become bound thereby , including fairly common situations in which internal juridical acts became , at the international level , simple juridical events .  69 .  Whatever the final scope of the topic turned out to be , his delegation would follow with particular interest the Commissions work on the regime of unilateral acts , particularly the question of their revocability .  
He reaffirmed his Governments view that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ; it opposed the specific reference to Jerusalem which had no effect on issues of sovereignty and prejudged the final political arrangements in territories that could be determined only by the direct negotiations to which the parties had committed themselves .

The argument put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army militia is responsible for the detention camp of Khiam , is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility , since Israel is the occupying power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies .

Despite the decision pursuant to the peace accords signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel to postpone discussion of certain items , including the matter of settlements , pending negotiations on final status , the illegal confiscation of Arab lands by the Israeli Government in order to build settlements was incompatible with the achievement by all parties of the common goal of economic and social stability .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :

Ambassador Moher arrived four years ago , at a crucial time , when the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty were entering their final stage , and he injected into our deliberations a remarkable blend of deep knowledge of the issues under negotiation , an ingredient of iron _ clad logic and a special ability to build bridges between opposing views .  
Given the recognized and authentic relationship which exists between disarmament and development and because it is immoral and unacceptable to squander resources on armaments while the needs of billions of human beings so unsatisfied , the final document resulting from the first special session devoted to disarmament , held in 1978 , included various references to the question in its paragraphs 16 , 35 , 89 , 94 and 95 .

Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .

Indeed , MINUGUA forms an integral part of those Agreements . 
But we must remember that it is a process : a series of steps which build upon each other so that the final result , which we firmly believe to be achievable , will have come about through gradual , careful and deliberate negotiation and not through imperfect solutions imposed from outside or as a consequence of inherent power imbalances or short-term political expediency .

Finally , the active involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions both in the final event and in the preparatory process was crucial : only through the coordinated efforts of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions would the common objective of poverty reduction and sustainable development be achieved .

Before entering into a discussion of the provisions of chapter V , the Working Group considered the general usefulness of chapter V and its scope as reflected in draft article 1 , paragraph 4 , which appeared within square brackets pending final determination of the scope or the purpose of chapter V .
