Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .  It is of great significance that our two countries establish and develop on the basis of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation a new relationship of cooperation and partnership characterized by mutual respect , mutual trust , equality and mutual benefit , long-term stability , and common development .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Within a period of more than five years , the whole army sent more than 1-million officers and men on various occasions to build the key national optical-fiber telecommunications line , and with their own hands , those officers and men have built a key optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up the south and the north of the Changjiang and connecting to the Eurasian continent .  The army units stationed along the line have connected themselves to the line , thus entering a photoelectric era with one stride .  
They said that China had for a long time provided unconditional economic assistance to the African continent , and even though China is not Africa 's major creditor , this action taken by China as a developing country is indicative of its sincere hope to join Africa in realizing the common development aspiration within the framework of South-South cooperation .  Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .  
In the twilight of the 20th century , the Chinese Navy sounded its siren as it sails into the ocean of the new century : Two naval formations charted new routes of crossing both the east and west hemispheres and the north and south hemispheres on the marine chart of the world this year , with one formation crossing the Pacific and reaching the North American continent and the other formation crossing the Indian Ocean , rounding the Cape of Good Hope and sailing into the Atlantic Ocean for the first time .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
PRC Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue has said that the OAU has completed its historic mission outstandingly well , and China sincerely wishes that the African Union will form a connecting link between past and future , carry forward the cause and forge ahead , and create still greater glory in building a peaceful and prosperous African continent .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
The meeting of the five countries ' heads of state held on 5 July in Dushanbe is a major event in the history of the Eurasian continent .  The " Dushanbe Statement " signed jointly by the five countries ' heads of state marks an excellent beginning of cooperation among the five countries in the new century which fully reflects the common wishes of the people of the five countries to be always friendly toward each other and to become eternal " good neighbors , good partners , and good friends . "  
But while reliable evidence is still lacking for a rational explanation to many doubtful issues , Professor Endre Galla , head of the Faculty of Chinese at Eotvos Lorand University at Budapest , jocularly points out that the Hungarians , always isolated like outsiders in Europe , are themselves only too happy to believe that they might be the Huns who once trampled over the continent ; at least , they claim some fairly close relation to the Huns .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Chen Yu-chun , the director of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Culture University , points out that when the US had formal diplomatic ties and a mutual security treaty with Taiwan , the US stated repeatedly that the treaty applied only to Taiwan and the Pescadores , not to Kinmen and Matsu ( the latter two islands being right on the coast of mainland China , as opposed to the former , which are more distant from the continent ) .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
Ever since the partisan balance of power shifted during the congressional and gubernatorial elections of 1994 , some people have remarked that the American continent has had a seismic shift to the right . Several rather conservative ideas , such as slashing social welfare and restricting immigration , have been proffered one after the other .  
Leaving aside the earliest relations between man and elephant , it was beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries , when Europeans first penetrated the continent , that the African elephant began to face mass slaughter . After three centuries of killing , the elephant population was devastated . In Capetown , South Africa , for example , when the government established the national park in 1931 , there were only 11 elephants , compared to the historical peak when at least 100,000 elephants roamed the grassy plain .  
Stained glass windows were a prominent feature of northern Europe 's gothic churches , while the walls and domes of the Byzantine churches of the south of the continent were decorated with biblical tales rendered in mosaics of multicolored glass tiles . It was as if glass , this brilliant , lustrous substance , could actually bring people closer to heaven .  
Taiwan , sitting at the intersection of the world 's largest continent with the world 's largest ocean , as an island with numerous mountains , has climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the temperate . An island rich in resources , Taiwan has been called " a microcosm of the northern hemisphere . "  
local press reporsts today quoted officials of the oau as saying that the conference was aimed at bringing to the notice of rich nations outside the continent , the severe hardship being experienced by african nations due to harsh conditions attached to loans from some creditor nations and organizations  
united nations , october 27 ( xinhua ) african economic recovery and development is not only linked with the long term stability in the continent , but also has an important bearing on the stable and healthy development of the entire world economy , said a top chinese diplomat today  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
Portugal , a country which is historically and culturally linked to Africa , is profoundly aware of the unparalleled , appalling and ever-deteriorating living conditions prevailing in vast regions of the continent . 
However , the continent must be the beneficiary of , inter alia , a major reduction in its debt burden , the elimination of obstacles to its exports , vigorous foreign investments and increasing international assistance better adapted to national policies .  
Despite the socioeconomic changes carried out in our States to stimulate private initiative and cooperative movements and to improve living conditions , the African continent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
The economic , social and political situation in Africa had continued to deteriorate , and the international community had been incapable of halting the continent 's increasing marginalization and impoverishment .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
However , throughout the entire history of the Asian continent , instability and protracted regional conflicts have often , unfortunately , constituted the political background , and this has significantly complicated the solution of problems of internal development .  
This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
We are a nation deeply committed to the proper functioning of democratic institutions , having attained a commendable political stability in our continent 's community of nations .  
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
To achieve this , Africa 's partners must transcend their previous ideas about cooperation with the continent and must overcome the accompanying donor fatigue , and must count on Africa 's natural determination to develop a dynamic of progress by which it will gain its proper place in the vast movement of international cooperation that is beneficial for all .  
These reports have been at once analytical , comprehensive and insightful inasmuch as they have exposed the dark cloud hanging over much of Africa , threatening to drag the continent deeper into economic ruin , social decay and political instability .  
This requires concerted action to ensure a consistent and incremental flow of resources , effective participation by African countries in international trade and a strategy to resolve the crushing debt problem faced by the continent .  
The international community 's assistance in these areas will not only offset the adverse consequences of the Uruguay Round , but also lay the ground for effective participation by Africa in the new international trade regime , through processing , manufacturing and distributing finished goods based on the continent 's primary commodities .  
As regards Africa , the steady deterioration of economic and social conditions can only contribute to confirming the pessimistic views regarding a continent that has been marginalized and left to its own devices to deal with the many political , economic , social and ecological crises besetting it .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
Here I would like to echo the proposal made by President Ben Ali , Chairman of the OAU last year , for a global economic and social plan aimed at ensuring the development of Africa on a sound and lasting basis , helping our continent overcome its shortcomings and become integrated into the world economy and ensuring dignified conditions of life for all the peoples of the continent .  
All the States of Africa pledged to make their contribution to the peace process under way and to the strict implementation of the agreements concluded for a lasting peace , which is the reason for the welcome presence here of a ministerial delegation composed of eminent sons of our continent .  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
In this forum I will limit myself to recalling the significant role of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the natural and constructive approach he had towards existing problems in the African continent , as well as his personal commitment towards charitable organizations with the purpose of raising funds for special social and development projects and programmes .  
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
Despite the new international situation that promotes less aggressive , less suspicious and less tense relations between States , the political instability that continues to exist in certain parts of Africa , and the conflicts that develop there , have become significant barriers to the economic recovery and social cohesion of the continent .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
It is inconceivable that , in an era when the virtues of democracy and good governance at the national level are being preached , such democracy is not applied at the level of the United Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member States is not represented in the Security Council in the permanent category .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
In an international environment characterized by the exacerbation of commercial , financial and cultural competition , in which international aid is becoming scarcer , strengthening the endogenous capacities of Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to take its destiny into its own hands .  
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
As a country that has suffered under the heavy burden of external debt and the ensuing social and economic hardships resulting from structural adjustment , Jamaica is fully aware of the difficulties currently being confronted by our sister nations on the African continent .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
The work of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) and other programmes and agencies in key social , economic and humanitarian initiatives outlined in the report are all of vital importance to efforts to improve the quality of life on the continent .  
It is on that continent that we find the greatest expression of the categorical need for renewed and strengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-mindedness and partnership to help African countries in their efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessary to lay the foundations for lasting political and social balance and to open new prospects of hope for their peoples .  
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
Even more recently , Africa signed the Pelindaba Treaty , making our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone , and thus making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the process of nuclear disarmament , which , in the context of ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty , has not gained the necessary impetus to preserve the future of mankind and to save succeeding generations from the nuclear scourge . 
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
The Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs shall be the organ responsible for coordinating the efforts of the region as a whole with the initiatives taken to counter threats to democratic security on the continent and in other parts of the world , and , in this sense , shall be the organ responsible for preparing positions and concluding cooperation accords or agreements with institutions and bodies responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security , independently of the previously established international commitments of each State Party . Article 64 .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
The main focus of the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Department of Public Information , is to raise global awareness of Africa 's critical economic situation and of the actions taken by Africa and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the continent .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
Australia 's own decision to suspend the use of anti _ personnel landmines and to support the negotiation of a global ban as soon as possible was not taken without considerable soul _ searching given that the defence challenge for Australia is to be able to protect a vast continent with a small professional armed force .  
Nevertheless , these decisive changes did not come about easily and had to make their way within an extremely hostile international setting marked by the cold war , and at a time when the so _ called national security doctrine was becoming established in many developing countries and across virtually the whole of the American continent .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
In that connection , he cited the numerous initiatives that had been undertaken by the President of Tunisia , Mr . Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and his continuing efforts to promote peace in Africa . Tunisia called upon the parties concerned to halt the fighting and re-establish peace , and invited international and regional organizations to provide assistance to the victims in order to avert a tragedy that would affect the entire African continent . 
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent . 
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
The preparation of a high-resolution digital mosaic of the ice sheet and exposed portions of the continent will help to better understand why changes in the ice sheet occur , providing more insight into the effects of human activity and global warming on the rapid retreat of large portions of the shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .  
Here again it must be recalled that the combined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and the lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj Omar Bongo , President of the Gabonese Republic and also of the international mediation committee , have , unfortunately , not managed to find a political way out of this grave internal crisis , the prolongation of which is a serious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
Equally historic is the balance achieved in civil and military relations , following the successes of April 1996 , when popular pressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the continent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated forms of autocracy .  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
Satellite communications systems , featured by large footprints ( coverage ) , ranging in size from a country to a continent , avoid the need for terrestrial infrastructure and shorten the time for establishing basic and advanced communications in rural areas .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Poverty was particularly severe on the African continent , which experienced a wide variety of epidemic and endemic diseases , a very low literacy rate , hunger and malnutrition and heavy external debt .  
From a geomorphological perspective , the shelf in ideal cases is the part of the seabed adjacent to the continent which forms a kind of large submerged terrace , the average surface of which generally dips gently seaward .  
Endowed with abundant natural resources , it is a promising continent with limitless potential in international economic development .  
Ghana was convinced that sustainable development held the key to global peace , and therefore appreciated the Departments focus of raising the profile of the African continent in the media .  
From north to south and east to west , passing through Central Africa , the clash of arms and the sound of bombs effectively beat out the rhythm of daily life in that ailing continent .  
Requests the Special Unit to ensure the effective implementation of the new directions strategy in Africa , bearing in mind the priority areas identified by African countries themselves in the Cairo Agenda for Action , as well as the Tokyo Agenda for Action , which stressed , among other things , the principles of accelerated economic growth for poverty reduction and further integration of the continent into the global economy in addition to the concepts of ownership and global partnership ;

The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
The view was expressed that African countries in particular had been marginalized in that field , which was an unfortunate situation , considering that the continent was faced with major social and economic problems , some of which could be solved by the application of space technology . 
Growth slowed in the majority of African countries and , at 2.6 per cent in 1998 , average gross domestic product for all of Africa fell far short of the eight per cent annual growth rate envisioned by the World Bank as the level capable of significantly reducing poverty levels on the continent .  
Central America is preparing to cross the bridge between the millennia with all its republics more integrated with each other than ever before , identifying with each other in the common ideal of keeping ourselves united so that we are stronger , of playing a stellar role in the American continent , of turning the isthmus into a point of strategic convergence for world trade , and of writing ourselves into a success story that will serve as an example and touchstone to the world community .  
This year , Nigeria , the giant of Africa , has achieved an impressively quick return to civilian rule after multi-party elections , while South Africa , the continent 's economic powerhouse , has successfully held its second democratic election , as well as undergone a smooth transition from the tenure of President Mandela to that of President Mbeki .  
Indeed , our continent is home to two thirds of the least developed countries and to three quarters of those at a low level of human development , and almost half of its inhabitants live in absolute poverty .  
Nevertheless , in spite of the picture of suffering and contrasts which the continent presents to the world ; in spite of the upheavals that wrack its civil societies ; and in spite of all the difficulties draining its capacity to steer its own way through a troublesome environment , Africa has taken the costly and demanding road of renewal that is so necessary if it is to assume control of its own destiny and to achieve a balanced world situation in the future .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
In this context , we would like to add that if the international community , just recently , was able to act in a concerted and comprehensive manner to resolve an issue which had received so much global attention , we firmly believe that if the same concerted and comprehensive approach were applied to Africa , it would surely resolve many of the major problems facing that continent .  
That support has been consistently reflected in Indonesias support of Africas objectives ; through our active participation in many international and regional forums , including our participation in various peacekeeping operations and South-South cooperation ; and also through the strong bilateral relations that Indonesia maintains throughout the continent .  
Everyone is aware that this trade has contributed to intensifying and prolonging armed conflicts in Africa , and to further complicating peacekeeping efforts by impeding economic and social development in certain regions of the continent .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite the policies of reform being implemented by African countries , their economic situation remains critical and African recovery and development continue to be severely hindered by , inter alia , the persistence of lower commodity prices and the heavy debt burden and are also substantially affected by the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment , as well as the ongoing conflicts in some regions of the continent ,  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
Situated on the crossroads between the east and the west , the north and the south of the continent , Belarus will be further contributing to international cooperation in combating transborder crime , terrorism and illicit drug trafficking .  
In that connection , the situation of the African continent is alarming : nearly two thirds of the least developed countries are located there ; approximately half of its population lives below the threshold of absolute poverty ; and its social indicators are among the lowest in the world .  
Our strong moral , political and financial support for the Tribunal will ensure not only that future dictatorial regimes will be effectively prosecuted for their actions , but that there will never be a repeat of genocide in our continent or , indeed , worldwide .  
Did not Baron de Coubertin aware as he was of the immense potential contribution of Africa to the Olympic Movement and the necessity to open up sport as a universal language and a permanent school of life to the colonized people of Africa advocated unsuccessfully the organization in 1928 of African games at Algiers , which were not held until half a century later in 1978 , bringing together the countries of the continent which were finally free . 
Mr . Gatilov ( Russian Federation ) ( spoke in Russian ) : Today ' s discussion is taking place against the backdrop of the major political outcomes of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) Istanbul summit , which laid down the basic guidelines for the formation of a stable architecture for security and cooperation on the European continent in the twenty-first century on the basis of the United Nations Charter and generally recognized principles of international law . 
As a logical consequence of the chronically unstable situation in certain parts of the continent and the constantly growing number of refugees generated by its convulsive conflicts , dealing with the humanitarian situation in Africa today is a major challenge to Africans and to the whole international community .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
In the social and economic fields , the United Nations plays a unique role in the development process on the African continent by continuously supporting the building of the OAUs institutional capacities to promote regional economic integration of the States of Africa and to enhance the continents ability to take advantage of international and bilateral initiatives to promote development .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
As we prepare to enter the twenty-first century , and cognizant of the challenges that will confront our continent and peoples , we emphasize the imperative need and a high sense of urgency to rekindle the aspirations of our peoples for stronger unity , solidarity and cohesion in a larger community of peoples transcending cultural , ideological , ethnic and national differences .  
He added that while almost every agency and operational arm of the United Nations had a special programme devoted to Africa , and even though the Organization had spent generous amounts of its resources on the continent , the United Nations still needed to be more involved in Africa and play a more effective role , as it does elsewhere , without undue preconditions .  
The Committee was fully aware of the delicate situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of efforts by numerous Governments , SADC , OAU , the Security Council and the Secretary-General to find a peaceful solution to a crisis which was likely to set the entire African continent aflame .  
As indicated in the communiqu of the SADC Summit meeting on the Democratic Republic of the Congo held on 23 August 1998 , the reconstruction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as an independent , sovereign , united , peaceful , stable and prosperous country is critical to the achievement of the same objectives in the region and in the rest of the African continent .  
When , after the end of the cold war , the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of interState conflicts , the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
In recent years the African continent has witnessed many acute struggles that threatened peace and security and led to difficult humanitarian situations , with tragic economic and social dimensions .  
Nevertheless , a stable , democratic political system had been established and the economic growth rate was currently 6.5 per cent per annum , which was a sizeable achievement in a country the size of a continent with a population approaching one-billion . 
In this regard , he emphasized the sad reality of an impoverished continent which is illequipped to play the game of globalization effectively , due mainly to the lack of educated and skilled human resources .  
To promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of the sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ;  
We have observed that the continent inherited a myriad of ills from the colonial past , which fundamentally affected the social , political and economic foundations of its society , thus constraining its present capacity for stability and development .  
Africa is a continent in which countless human beings men , women , children and young people have in a sense been left by the wayside , ill , wounded , powerless , marginalized and abandoned .  
The international community hopes for a return to peace and economic recovery in the Great Lakes region , especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is most unusual geopolitically , as it lies at the centre of the African continent , and which is exceptionally rich in a wide variety of natural resources , whose overexploitation by the belligerents without the least benefit to the people of the Congo is one of the leading causes of the conflict . 
In the declaration it adopted at the Summit meeting in September of last year , the Council reaffirmed its determination to give equal priority to the maintenance of international peace and security in every region of the world , while paying special attention to the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , in view of the special needs of the continent and the specific characteristics of the conflicts raging on its territories .  
In order to extricate the continent from its deep-rooted socioeconomic problems , domestic policy reforms had to be accompanied by concerted action at the global level , including measures designed to achieve an expeditious resolution of the debt crisis , enhanced productive capacity , improved and expanded market access , increased official development assistance and a more generous transfer of technology .  
Gravely concerned with the illicit manufacturing , stockpiling of , trafficking in , possession and use of firearms and , especially , those used in the commission of violent crimes and their contribution to the high level of instability , prolonged conflict and social dislocation that is evident in southern Africa and the African continent as a whole ,  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Noting with grave concern that Africa , in particular sub-Saharan Africa , is currently the worst affected region where HIV / AIDS is considered as a state of emergency , which threatens development , social cohesion , political stability , food security and life expectancy and imposes a devastating economic burden and that the dramatic situation on the continent needs urgent and exceptional national , regional and international action ;  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
The problems in Africa have only worsened , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and in mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and members of criminal organizations who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
With more than 6 million square kilometres of territory , more than 100-million inhabitants , a central geostrategic position in Africa and extraordinary mining potential , Central Africa deserves the sustained attention of the international community , because its stability will determine the development of the rest of the continent . 
Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .  It is of great significance that our two countries establish and develop on the basis of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation a new relationship of cooperation and partnership characterized by mutual respect , mutual trust , equality and mutual benefit , long-term stability , and common development .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Within a period of more than five years , the whole army sent more than 1-million officers and men on various occasions to build the key national optical-fiber telecommunications line , and with their own hands , those officers and men have built a key optical-fiber telecommunications network linking up the south and the north of the Changjiang and connecting to the Eurasian continent .  The army units stationed along the line have connected themselves to the line , thus entering a photoelectric era with one stride .  
They said that China had for a long time provided unconditional economic assistance to the African continent , and even though China is not Africa 's major creditor , this action taken by China as a developing country is indicative of its sincere hope to join Africa in realizing the common development aspiration within the framework of South-South cooperation .  Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .  
In the twilight of the 20th century , the Chinese Navy sounded its siren as it sails into the ocean of the new century : Two naval formations charted new routes of crossing both the east and west hemispheres and the north and south hemispheres on the marine chart of the world this year , with one formation crossing the Pacific and reaching the North American continent and the other formation crossing the Indian Ocean , rounding the Cape of Good Hope and sailing into the Atlantic Ocean for the first time .  
A vast ocean separates China and the United States . China has never sent a single soldier to areas near the US continent , nor has China dispatched a reconnaissance plane to US coastal areas .  The United States , on the contrary , has never stopped conducting hostile surveillance , probing flights and harassing activities toward China since the founding of New China .  
PRC Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue has said that the OAU has completed its historic mission outstandingly well , and China sincerely wishes that the African Union will form a connecting link between past and future , carry forward the cause and forge ahead , and create still greater glory in building a peaceful and prosperous African continent .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
The meeting of the five countries ' heads of state held on 5 July in Dushanbe is a major event in the history of the Eurasian continent .  The " Dushanbe Statement " signed jointly by the five countries ' heads of state marks an excellent beginning of cooperation among the five countries in the new century which fully reflects the common wishes of the people of the five countries to be always friendly toward each other and to become eternal " good neighbors , good partners , and good friends . "  
But while reliable evidence is still lacking for a rational explanation to many doubtful issues , Professor Endre Galla , head of the Faculty of Chinese at Eotvos Lorand University at Budapest , jocularly points out that the Hungarians , always isolated like outsiders in Europe , are themselves only too happy to believe that they might be the Huns who once trampled over the continent ; at least , they claim some fairly close relation to the Huns .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Chen Yu-chun , the director of the Institute of American Studies at Chinese Culture University , points out that when the US had formal diplomatic ties and a mutual security treaty with Taiwan , the US stated repeatedly that the treaty applied only to Taiwan and the Pescadores , not to Kinmen and Matsu ( the latter two islands being right on the coast of mainland China , as opposed to the former , which are more distant from the continent ) .  
This is the time of year when the weather is affected by cold high-pressure areas from the continent . These create sharp differences in temperature , generating strong upward currents . Also , humidity is low , and there is less concern about rain caused by hot air currents running into cold air at high altitudes .  
Ever since the partisan balance of power shifted during the congressional and gubernatorial elections of 1994 , some people have remarked that the American continent has had a seismic shift to the right . Several rather conservative ideas , such as slashing social welfare and restricting immigration , have been proffered one after the other .  
Leaving aside the earliest relations between man and elephant , it was beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries , when Europeans first penetrated the continent , that the African elephant began to face mass slaughter . After three centuries of killing , the elephant population was devastated . In Capetown , South Africa , for example , when the government established the national park in 1931 , there were only 11 elephants , compared to the historical peak when at least 100,000 elephants roamed the grassy plain .  
Stained glass windows were a prominent feature of northern Europe 's gothic churches , while the walls and domes of the Byzantine churches of the south of the continent were decorated with biblical tales rendered in mosaics of multicolored glass tiles . It was as if glass , this brilliant , lustrous substance , could actually bring people closer to heaven .  
Taiwan , sitting at the intersection of the world 's largest continent with the world 's largest ocean , as an island with numerous mountains , has climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the temperate . An island rich in resources , Taiwan has been called " a microcosm of the northern hemisphere . "  
local press reporsts today quoted officials of the oau as saying that the conference was aimed at bringing to the notice of rich nations outside the continent , the severe hardship being experienced by african nations due to harsh conditions attached to loans from some creditor nations and organizations  
united nations , october 27 ( xinhua ) african economic recovery and development is not only linked with the long term stability in the continent , but also has an important bearing on the stable and healthy development of the entire world economy , said a top chinese diplomat today  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
Portugal , a country which is historically and culturally linked to Africa , is profoundly aware of the unparalleled , appalling and ever-deteriorating living conditions prevailing in vast regions of the continent . 
However , the continent must be the beneficiary of , inter alia , a major reduction in its debt burden , the elimination of obstacles to its exports , vigorous foreign investments and increasing international assistance better adapted to national policies .  
Despite the socioeconomic changes carried out in our States to stimulate private initiative and cooperative movements and to improve living conditions , the African continent is still experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
The economic , social and political situation in Africa had continued to deteriorate , and the international community had been incapable of halting the continent 's increasing marginalization and impoverishment .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
However , throughout the entire history of the Asian continent , instability and protracted regional conflicts have often , unfortunately , constituted the political background , and this has significantly complicated the solution of problems of internal development .  
This exceptional diplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the peaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world Power and a small country , which today have excellent relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and mutual respect , as is appropriate for two States committed to efforts to consolidate prosperity , peace , security and democracy on the continent .  
We are a nation deeply committed to the proper functioning of democratic institutions , having attained a commendable political stability in our continent 's community of nations .  
A look at the political configuration of the United Nations reveals a strange paradox : at a time when hotbeds of tension are concentrated in Africa , at a time when poverty there has broken every record and at a time when natural and man-made disasters are proliferating , many international forums are seeking to reduce our continent to the status of a poor relative .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
This fiftieth anniversary might also have been a time to rejoice that the countries that 50 years ago were poor and dominated , especially those on the African continent , now find themselves today among the prosperous nations of our planet , a natural position , given their boundless natural resources .  
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
To achieve this , Africa 's partners must transcend their previous ideas about cooperation with the continent and must overcome the accompanying donor fatigue , and must count on Africa 's natural determination to develop a dynamic of progress by which it will gain its proper place in the vast movement of international cooperation that is beneficial for all .  
These reports have been at once analytical , comprehensive and insightful inasmuch as they have exposed the dark cloud hanging over much of Africa , threatening to drag the continent deeper into economic ruin , social decay and political instability .  
This requires concerted action to ensure a consistent and incremental flow of resources , effective participation by African countries in international trade and a strategy to resolve the crushing debt problem faced by the continent .  
The international community 's assistance in these areas will not only offset the adverse consequences of the Uruguay Round , but also lay the ground for effective participation by Africa in the new international trade regime , through processing , manufacturing and distributing finished goods based on the continent 's primary commodities .  
As regards Africa , the steady deterioration of economic and social conditions can only contribute to confirming the pessimistic views regarding a continent that has been marginalized and left to its own devices to deal with the many political , economic , social and ecological crises besetting it .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
Here I would like to echo the proposal made by President Ben Ali , Chairman of the OAU last year , for a global economic and social plan aimed at ensuring the development of Africa on a sound and lasting basis , helping our continent overcome its shortcomings and become integrated into the world economy and ensuring dignified conditions of life for all the peoples of the continent .  
All the States of Africa pledged to make their contribution to the peace process under way and to the strict implementation of the agreements concluded for a lasting peace , which is the reason for the welcome presence here of a ministerial delegation composed of eminent sons of our continent .  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
In this forum I will limit myself to recalling the significant role of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the natural and constructive approach he had towards existing problems in the African continent , as well as his personal commitment towards charitable organizations with the purpose of raising funds for special social and development projects and programmes .  
In this manner , we are seeking to include Africa in all its aspects on the international agenda , stressing , on the one hand , the scale and economic potential of the African continent , which is deserving of a new approach and a new model for dialogue , and , on the other hand , encouraging African countries to embark on their own process of development based on the promotion of peace , democracy , stability and economic and social progress .  
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
Despite the new international situation that promotes less aggressive , less suspicious and less tense relations between States , the political instability that continues to exist in certain parts of Africa , and the conflicts that develop there , have become significant barriers to the economic recovery and social cohesion of the continent .  
While it is true that socio-economic development in Africa is first of all the responsibility of the peoples and Governments of the African countries themselves , it none the less remains true that the international community , in particular its most developed and industrialized members , must do their part , a part commensurate with their true means , in the development process of a continent involved in a dual economic and political transition .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
It is inconceivable that , in an era when the virtues of democracy and good governance at the national level are being preached , such democracy is not applied at the level of the United Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member States is not represented in the Security Council in the permanent category .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
This commitment is reflected in the vital and multifaceted relations that we have with African Governments both at the bilateral level and through a range of multilateral agencies , and which take the form of the continuing engagement of Canadian non-governmental organizations throughout the continent , and growing number of partnerships in the private sector . 
In an international environment characterized by the exacerbation of commercial , financial and cultural competition , in which international aid is becoming scarcer , strengthening the endogenous capacities of Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to take its destiny into its own hands .  
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
As a country that has suffered under the heavy burden of external debt and the ensuing social and economic hardships resulting from structural adjustment , Jamaica is fully aware of the difficulties currently being confronted by our sister nations on the African continent .  
I should also like to reiterate the proposal made by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , President of the Republic of Tunisia , advocating the concept of a global economic and social plan aimed at guaranteeing African growth on sound and lasting bases and at assisting our continent to remedy its deficiencies , achieve integration into the world economy and ensure dignified living conditions for all peoples in Africa .  
The work of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) , the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) and other programmes and agencies in key social , economic and humanitarian initiatives outlined in the report are all of vital importance to efforts to improve the quality of life on the continent .  
It is on that continent that we find the greatest expression of the categorical need for renewed and strengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-mindedness and partnership to help African countries in their efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessary to lay the foundations for lasting political and social balance and to open new prospects of hope for their peoples .  
After 14 years of consideration of this item in this Committee , my delegation is gratified that the international community now has a better understanding of this remote and pristine continent and of the need for collective efforts to protect this fragile and vulnerable environment for the common benefit of humankind . 
During this time , Member States that have participated in the deliberations have spoken on a wide range of issues surrounding that continent , especially its role and influence on the atmosphere , oceans , biological conditions of the entire global system and the fragility of its environment , which is vulnerable to the impact of human activities .  
Even more recently , Africa signed the Pelindaba Treaty , making our continent a nuclear-weapon-free zone , and thus making a substantial contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the process of nuclear disarmament , which , in the context of ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty , has not gained the necessary impetus to preserve the future of mankind and to save succeeding generations from the nuclear scourge . 
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
The Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs shall be the organ responsible for coordinating the efforts of the region as a whole with the initiatives taken to counter threats to democratic security on the continent and in other parts of the world , and , in this sense , shall be the organ responsible for preparing positions and concluding cooperation accords or agreements with institutions and bodies responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security , independently of the previously established international commitments of each State Party . Article 64 .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
The main focus of the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Department of Public Information , is to raise global awareness of Africa 's critical economic situation and of the actions taken by Africa and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the continent .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
Australia 's own decision to suspend the use of anti _ personnel landmines and to support the negotiation of a global ban as soon as possible was not taken without considerable soul _ searching given that the defence challenge for Australia is to be able to protect a vast continent with a small professional armed force .  
Nevertheless , these decisive changes did not come about easily and had to make their way within an extremely hostile international setting marked by the cold war , and at a time when the so _ called national security doctrine was becoming established in many developing countries and across virtually the whole of the American continent .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
In that connection , he cited the numerous initiatives that had been undertaken by the President of Tunisia , Mr . Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and his continuing efforts to promote peace in Africa . Tunisia called upon the parties concerned to halt the fighting and re-establish peace , and invited international and regional organizations to provide assistance to the victims in order to avert a tragedy that would affect the entire African continent . 
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
Africa now needs to address three main requirements : first , the striving for the peaceful settlement of conflicts occurring in a number of its regions , as well as for urgent solutions to the problems of refugees ; secondly , the achievement of economic and social development and the enhancement of integration , both at the level of the continent as a whole and on the level of subregional groupings ; and thirdly , the turn to democratization and to the respect for human rights by African communities .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent . 
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
The preparation of a high-resolution digital mosaic of the ice sheet and exposed portions of the continent will help to better understand why changes in the ice sheet occur , providing more insight into the effects of human activity and global warming on the rapid retreat of large portions of the shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula .  
Here again it must be recalled that the combined efforts of the United Nations and the OAU and the lucid and commendable actions of President El Hadj Omar Bongo , President of the Gabonese Republic and also of the international mediation committee , have , unfortunately , not managed to find a political way out of this grave internal crisis , the prolongation of which is a serious threat to peace in the subregion and the continent .  
A growing number of countries on our continent , including my own country , Ethiopia , have taken decisive measures to liberalize their economies , to cut Government spending , to institute sound macroeconomic policies and to enhance the role of the private sector and civil society .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
Equally historic is the balance achieved in civil and military relations , following the successes of April 1996 , when popular pressure and the enormous weight of solidarity on the continent thwarted attempts to take us back to outdated forms of autocracy .  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
We also recognized that the problems of the environment , such as global warming , the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems , the degradation of forests , desertification and the overuse of mineral resources are concerns not of any one nation or continent , but of the entire international community .  
Vicious circles of unsound policies , predatory politics , natural disasters , violent conflict and the neglect of the developed countries have isolated large parts of the continent from the mainstream of global development .
