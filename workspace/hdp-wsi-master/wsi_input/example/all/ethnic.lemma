It is reported that the two ethnic groups living in the Ituri region , Hema and Lendu , have been in rivalry for a long time , fighting for land resources and the like .  In recent months , there have been continuous mass armed clashes , causing tremendous casulty and losses .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
Addressing a national conference of nationalities affairs commissions on economic work which closed today , Li Dezhu , Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , noted : as far as ethnic affairs are concerned , we must be brave in blazing new trails , boldly explore new frontiers , improve the quality of our work , thus make contributions to the large-scale development of the western region .  
Nationalities affairs commissions at all levels must seize the opportunity , always focus on economic construction as the center , proceed from the state 's major political guideline and from the actual circumstances of ethnic areas in the western part of the country , research into the policy and measures for expediting the development of ethnic areas , study specific issues such as reform and opening up , social progress , and key tasks that aim to help impoverished areas , and properly handle the relationship between development and unity .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
So long as our party always acts as the faithful representative of the demands of the development of the advanced social productive forces in the China , the direction of the development of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party will forever be in an invincible position , and will forever have the heartfelt support of the people of all ethnic groups of the country and continuously lead them forward .  
It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
Deputy Abdulahat Abdurixit , chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People 's Government , stated : Large-scale development of western regions has offered ethnic minorities regions ' development with a historical opportunity unknown in the past , while a stable social environment is the prerequisite for large-scale development , for nothing could be accomplished without a stable social environment . 
Inner Mongolia deputies Liu Mingzu , Yun Bulong , Lei Eerdeni , Niu Yuru , Chen Pengshan , Ma Dehai , Wang Weishan , Zhu Guangkai and Cha Gan separately expressed their views on the autonomous region 's economic development , large-scale development of China 's Western Region , transformation of old industrial base , exploitation of rare earth elements , grassland construction , reform of state-owned enterprises , establishment of a social security system , economic restructuring , and attaching importance to education in ethnic minority regions .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
The decision is of great significance to expand domestic demand and bring about sustained growth of national economy , to promote coordinated economic development in all regions and eventually achieve a common prosperity , and to strengthen ethnic unity , maintain social stability and fortify border defense .  
Observers here are convinced that the fundamental cause of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is because the UN delegation and international peacekeeping force in Kosovo have not earnestly implemented Resolution 1244 adopted by the UNSC but are carrying out a policy of " supporting Albanians and suppressing Serbs . " They have shown partiality for and connived with Albanian extremists ' " ethnic cleansing " against other nationalities .  
The United States led NATO to conduct military intervention in the ethnic dispute inside the FRY and to openly support the " Kosovo Liberation Army , " a terrorist and splittist organization .  This created a bad precedent in supporting national splittism and terrorist activities in the domain of international relations .  The national splittist forces in some countries and international terrorists saw their chance and started provoking and making trouble .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
and we should learn from them in taking a firm stance and clearly distinguishing between right and wrong , cherish the excellent situation of stability and unity , and resolutely wage struggle against phenomena that jeopardize ethnic solidarity , national security , and social stability , as practical deeds for preserving social and political stability .  
Under the CPC leadership , the Chinese people , with their firm conviction and hard work , have been relying on their own efforts and waging arduous struggles ; and they have achieved brilliant successes in the great course of building socialism .  Now , guided by the grand objectives set by the 15th National Party Congress for cross-century development , people of all ethnic groups in the country are confidently heading toward the new century .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory shine in the annals of the public , which have recorded the glorious course traversed by the people of all ethnic groups in their arduous struggle led by the CPC , engraved the great achievements made in the process of creating and building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and crystallized the wisdom and strategies of the party 's three generations of leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as their cores .  
They have shown their spirit of persistent struggle and demonstrated excellent sports techniques and displayed the lofty morality of sports .  They have shown the Chinese nation 's outlook of being inspired , struggling for progress , and being vigorous and enthusiastic .  They have contributed to the promotion and development of the Olympic spirit and greatly inspired all ethnic groups of people throughout the country and officers and soldiers throughout the military , who are marching into the new century with their chins up .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .  
Provided that our party remains the requirement of the development of advanced social productivity in China , the way forward for advanced culture in China and the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , it will always be invincible , will always have the heartfelt support of all ethnic groups throughout the country and will be able to lead the masses in pressing ahead incessantly .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
The third generation leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the vision and leadership skill to handle various complex situations , face various risks and resolve various difficulties .  This leadership group , which has won sincere support and admiration of the whole Party , the entire military and all ethnic groups of the country , is the loyal , reliable , diligent and promising successor of the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
We must hold aloft the banner of ethnic solidarity and progress , vigorously propagate the party 's ethnic and religious policies , and do more practical and good things for the minority-nationality masses , to consolidate the excellent situation of people of all nationalities breathing the same air , sharing the same destiny , and being linked heart to heart .  
How can they allow their constantly improving livelihood be jeopardized by the Dalai . In the questionnaires , the residents in the Chengguan District of Lhasa City have given a resounding answer .  They , as well as the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , are deeply aware that the blind religious worship people have for the Dalai Lama , who has ulterior motives , has not only stifled their ideas but also shackled their hands and feet ;  
not only will it deprive them of an affluent life , but it may restore the history written in blood and tears .  The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have deep-seated hatred for the feudal serf system of the old Tibet , entertain an infinite love for the socialist new Tibet , and cherish intense hatred for the Dalai 's separatist and sabotage activities .  
The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
At present , with the kind attention of the central authorities and the vigorous support of the people of the whole country , the people of all ethnic groups in our region are firmly seizing the rare opportunity provided by the stable political situation and the large-scale development of west China and , with unprecedented enthusiasm and drive , striking up a magnificent movement of leapfrogging development .  
Qian Qichen said : " During my visit , I also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the US Congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic Chinese community , and community of Chinese people residing in the United States . They all expressed the wish to see China and the United States friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
People of countries the world over , politicians , political parties , social groups , and media of many countries including the United States , and overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have made speeches and published articles supporting the Chinese Government 's just stance and the spirit of struggle in showing no fear of mighty power , attacked the unreasonable and unjustified US attitude , and exposed the US conspiracy to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and establish world hegemony .  
Due to the constraints of historical and geographical factors , the level of economic and social development in some areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is comparatively backward .  
Li Baodong pointed out : According to this strategy , the Chinese Government will appropriate huge amounts of funds for developing infrastructure facilities and basic industries in these areas , thus keeping the economic growth rate in these areas higher than the national average .  Last year , the economic growth rate in the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups reached 8.5 percent .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
At today 's pledging and mobilizing meeting held by the city public security organs in Urumqi City to launch the " hard striking " anti-crime struggle , Du Jianxi said that although ethnic separatists and violent terrorists were suppressed in most cases , they still pose a threat to social and political stability .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Hence , in the drive to " strike hard " and put things in order , it is necessary to make full preparations to consistently regard as the most important thing the crackdown on organized crime , especially organized crime of all kinds committed by backbone ethnic separatist elements , elements who commit bombing and terrorism , and extremist religious elements ; we must take the initiative to attack them , and hit them as soon as they show themselves .  
Attention should also be paid to recruiting female party members from urban resident communities , social organizations , non-public economic organizations , and areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  The structure of the party rank and file should be continuously improved .  Party organizations should be extended more widely to various social circles .  
He paid close attention to launching a struggle against ethnic separatism , being aware of the collusion between a handful of ethnic separatist elements at home and abroad and international anti-China forces to carry out separatist and disruptive activities against our country .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Comrade Wang Wei was an outstanding representative of contemporary Chinese youths .  He epitomized the characteristics of the young generation of our time - - ambitious , eager to learn , bold in practice , always thinking about the interests of the motherland , and keen to serve the people .  He is the example whom the youths of all ethnic groups throughout the country in the new period should learn from .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
They said : Following the plane collision incident , the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country worried about Wang Wei and shared a bitter hatred of the hegemonic act , thereby fully demonstrating the strong cohesive force of the Chinese nation .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
When inspecting the earthquake-stricken areas in Garze Zhang Autonomous Prefecture , Sichuan Province a few days ago , State Concillor Ismail Amat stressed : Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and with support of the people throughout China , the people of disaster areas heightened fighting spirit , worked cease lily and unremittingly , further strengthened ethnic unity , carried out reconstruction in disaster areas in a down-to-earth and effective manner , and won a comprehensive victory in earthquake relief work .  
Efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the central authorities pursuing the large-scale western development strategy , put reconstruction work onto the local governments ' 10th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development and their programs for poverty eradication through development , promote development through the reconstruction efforts , and unceasingly facilitate common prosperity among all ethnic groups .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
This law also explicitly states that " the national defense education should adhere to the strategy that all ethnic groups should participate in this education in a permanent , persistent and effective manner and should conform to the principle of uniting regular education with centralized education , associating polarization education with education for special purposes and combining theory education with behavioral education . "  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
On the afternoon of 22 May , patriotic personages of all ethnic groups from all social circles across the region held a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Looking back at the tremendous changes that had taken place in Tibet under the leadership of the CPC over the past half a century , they warmly lauded the glorious practice and the great victory of the party 's policies towards nationalities , religion , and the united front in Tibet .  
Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and thanks to the vigorous support and selfless assistance of all brother provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have forged ahead in unity in a pioneering spirit , speeded up the region 's development , defended the unification of the motherland and fought against national splittism , and have attained world-acclaimed achievements in the region 's socialist revolutionary and construction undertakings .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
The result is that the gap between the poor and the rich has widened , relations between ethnic groups have become tense , and class confrontations have intensified .  No doubt that the middle - and lower-class have been displeased , many people of the upper class , including such moderate of the Republican Party as Jeffords , also have been complaining quite a lot .  
During a recent inspection tour of Sichuan , Zhu Rongji , member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and premier of the State Council , pointed out that the implementation of the project to protect natural forests and the experiments on returning farmland land to forests at selected points have progressed smoothly and remarkable results have been obtained .  In particular , this has further speeded up the economic development of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
He emphasized that in the final analysis , the realization of comprehensive prosperity and development of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is determined by whether or not the broad masses of people and cadres of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups can increase their confidence , rely on themselves , and work hard and perseveringly to make common progress .  
In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
The university has also trained a large number of professional and technical cadres , specialists , scholars , and professors , who have made remarkable contributions in their own posts to the cause of building socialism and the maintaining of the unification of the motherland and the unity of various nationalities and played an extremely important role in the economic and social development of areas inhabited by ethnic groups .  
He spoke highly of the important role of the corps in production , construction , consolidating frontier defense , maintaining stability , and promoting ethnic solidarity , and encouraged its members to keep firmly in mind the heavy tasks entrusted them by the party and the people , further increase their sense of the historical mission and political responsibility of defending the border area and doing farm work there , and give full play to their role of a mainstay in promoting Xinjiang 's economic and social development and maintaining Xinjiang 's stability .  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
At the fifth " Shanghai Five " summit held in July 2000 in Dushanbe , leaders of the member states reiterated their determination to " jointly combat such international criminal activities that contribute the most threats to the region 's security , stability and development such as ethnic separatism , religious extremism , international terrorism , illegal arms smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal migration . "  It also proposed to sign treaties and pacts on multilateral cooperation among the member states .  
This unprecedented photo exhibition - - in chronological order and by means of detailed and genuine materials and vivid pictures of the past - - genuinely repeats the splendid 80-year history of the Communist Party of China , affectingly recalling the lofty spirit that inspired countless revolutionary martyrs to die .  The exhibition enthusiastically sings praise to the great achievements of the revolution , the construction and reform made by all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
He said , overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have transnational culture , and there are also many specialized talented people among them ; there are more than 100,000 highly talented Chinese in science and technology and various specialities in North America ; this is advantageous for the United States in opening up the China market , for China 's economic construction , and for ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese to develop their business .  
After giving a briefing on the main problems that affect social stability for the time being , Luo Gan listed the efforts to be made in the next step : First , strictly guard against and severely crack down on the criminal activities of the ethnic separatist forces , the religious extremist forces , and the violent terrorist forces , deal harsh blows at the sabotage activities of the hostile forces , and resolutely safeguard national security and unity .  
An official of the Ministry of Public Security has revealed that the current main factors for instability in China are : " the activities of hostile forces abroad , of ethnic separatist organizations , and of ' Falungong ' " ; criminal terrorist activities involving ethnic separatist organizations and related religious extremist forces have the greatest impact on social tranquillity , while there have recently been " new trends " in the activities of " Falungong . "  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
Looking into China 's future in the 21st century , the economy is prosperous , all ethnic groups are united , society is stable , governmental administration is smooth , and people are friendly and happy in this flourishing and prosperous situation .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
They included college students of the 56 ethnic groups , young pioneers wearing red ties , and outstanding athletes who won remarkable results in domestic and international sports events .  
He first expressed warm welcome to the triumphant return of the delegation on behalf of the party central leadership , the State Council , and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , expressed warm congratulations and cordial greetings to the members of the bidding delegation and all people participating in the bidding work , and expressed heartfelt gratitude to all friends who support Beijing 's bid .  
You have been staunchly struggling against Western hostile forces and nationalistic separatist elements and winning major victories in quelling rebellious forces , suppressing bandits , and fighting back against the enemies in defending ourselves , thus effectively maintaining Tibet 's social stability and stability in Tibet 's border areas , and defending national sovereignty , territorial integrity , and ethnic unity .  You have been endeavoring to fulfill the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people ;  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that " as long as our Party always represents the requirements of the development of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our Party will be in an invincible position , will always receive the great support of the people of every ethnic group across the country and will lead the people in continuously pressing ahead . "  
" Unprecedentedly , Taiwan is in contact and linked with the motherland . "  This has enabled the people on the island to understand the motherland in greater depth and changed their impression about the mainland , thereby enhancing to a great extent their sense of ethnic identification and unity with the motherland .  A profound social and psychological foundation has thus been established for " one country , two systems " to go deep into the hearts of the Taiwan people .  
This great historical process is a necessity in the social and historical development of Tibet , is a common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , and is also a brilliant example as how the CPC has applied the basic principles of Marxism for the resolution of China 's national issues .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .

Because of the rapid development in education , science and technology , culture , public health and other social services , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have achieved substantial progress in ideological and moral awareness and in their knowledge about science and other academic subjects .  
In the long historical development , the hardworking and intelligent people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have made remarkable contributions to creating the shinning cultures of the Chinese nation and to building our unified multinational country .  The brilliant chapter of Tibet 's development and progress in the past 50 years that you have written has added new glory to the big family of our socialist motherland .  
The celebrations have fully reflected the tremendous progress achieved by Tibet over the past 50 years , given wide publicity to the principles and policies of the central authorities toward Tibet , considerably aroused the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups in building up a new socialist Tibet , and will surely bring about a vigorous development to all undertakings in Tibet in the new century .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
At this jubilant moment , we would like to extend festival congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the army and the armed police force , the militiamen and the reserves , cordial regards to retired old cadres , demobilized servicemen , disabled soldiers and family members of martyrs , who have made outstanding contribution to the building of the people 's army , and high respect to people of all ethnic groups across the country who are concerned about and support national defense and army building ! 
Tibet learned firsthand that the Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative of the interests of all the peoples of Tibet .

In particular , in 1999 , centering on major events such as the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state , the 40th anniversary of the democratic revolution in Tibet , the Lhasa area contests of the sixth national ethnic minority games , and the reversion of Macao , the whole region carried out two major checks on the use of script in society , with the focus on Lhasa , and achieved regular , artistic , and clean use of script in society , thus displaying a good image of Tibet .  
and it is also the requirement of speeding up the improvement of ethnic quality and promoting the joint progress of all minorities .

The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .  The improvement in such environment itself is a kind of important fundamental construction , which is just as important as the construction of infrastructure and other hardware .  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .

" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' ! "  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
Firstly , there is strong support among Taiwan 's population of 22 million people , regardless of ethnic group or provincial ancestry , for the concept of " new Taiwanese . " We share a common life and our interests fully coincide , and as we confront the latest round of threats from communist China it is vital that we rally together to protect our own national security .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
Fortunately , in the years since the lifting of martial law , once-downtrodden ethnic groups have begun to gain political clout and a sense of self-determination . The view that aboriginal culture must be preserved has become " politically correct " and mainstream . But social benefits to the aborigines can not depend on some fuzzy sense of charity . The aborigines need more thoughtful and efficacious aid .  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
Chiueh Tzi-hong is confident that future astronomy programs will naturally come to generate more " added value . " He quotes the example of the participation of the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Physics in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) program led by ethnic Chinese Nobel laureate Professor Samuel Ting . The AMS instrument , which is designed to detect antimatter cosmic rays in space , will fly on the International Space Station , and Taiwan is responsible for manufacturing some of the electronic circuitry .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
Because the number of samples used in Lin 's study was small , because the results of her estimates could not be verified , and because there were ethical misgivings concerning ethnic bias , the Department of Health turned down her offer to use 10,000 doses of a screening reagent manufactured by Mackay Memorial Hospital to test doctors and nurses who were treating SARS patients . Lin was frustrated and bewildered by this decision , because all she had wanted to do was to help reduce the dangers to which medical personnel were exposed .  
Non governmental exchanges will help establish direct links between cultural groups of the two sides who have common interests However , he added , ethnic characteristics in various cultures must be preserved during the process of developing friendly relationship  
A stable political situation with no acute ethnic conflicts has also made Romania increasingly accepted as a safe investment by the international community , which has , in turn , heightened foreign investor confidence  
He further stated that cultural organizations specific to an ethnic group were permissible , but political parties based on ethnicity were not legal since membership would necessarily be discriminatory .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The result was a radical change in international relations , a profound shift in the balance of power and the emergence of underlying ethnic and national extremist trends which were suppressed under the former rule .  
As has been observed , ethnic tensions have become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies all over the globe - the advanced , the developing , the relatively stable and the unstable alike .  
To the infinite regret and dismay of the whole international community , we have continued to witness the outbreak of a great number of ethnic and national conflicts , accompanied by the untold suffering of innocent people .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
The collapse of empires has let loose the savage impulse to settle historical scores , redress ancient ethnic grievances , and set right real or imagined injustices over national borders , the treatment of minorities , or the control of resources .  
Indeed , the promise of global peace and security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by political and ethnic conflicts , economic and social disorder , and deepening poverty , particularly in developing countries .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
It is true that some of them have been successfully resolved , but many others , of an ethnic , racial and religious nature , are arising in various parts of the world and are raging unabated , rendering the world situation fragile and precarious .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
The recent dramatic increase in natural and man-made disasters and civil and ethnic strife has made an effective and coordinated response by the international community absolutely essential .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
In some regions of Europe , Africa and Asia , religious , ethnic , tribal and border conflicts , often of tragic proportions , are still raging , thus making the international situation unstable and fragile .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
Concerning article 5 of the Convention , members requested further information about enjoyment of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights set out in article 5 of the Convention , having regard to the country 's various ethnic groups .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The Committee underlined that nondiscrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental , civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights must be effectively guaranteed in law and actively protected in practice if further ethnic unrest was to be avoided .  
For 20 months we have been spectators helpless spectators of aggression , territorial conquest , " ethnic cleansing " , intolerance of every kind , and continuing massive , flagrant , systematic violations of human rights .  
If the existence of the numerous mass graves situated at or near identified detention facilities were to be confirmed , such confirmation would be relevant to the inquiry into " ethnic cleansing " ( see paras .  129150 ) .  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
In other words , " collective responsibility " a primitive and archaic concept will gain the upper hand ; eventually whole groups will be held guilty of massacres , torture , rape , ethnic cleansing , the wanton destruction of cities and villages .  
The Governments concerned should therefore set goals for the reversal of that tendency by educating the public to accept cultural , ethnic and religious diversity with a view to promoting communal harmony and understanding .  
However , most countries were composed of distinct ethnic , linguistic , religious and cultural minorities , and it was necessary to balance respect for the rights of minorities and preservation of national unity and territorial integrity .  
It fully shared the concern of the international community at the human rights violations committed in that country , and condemned the practices of ethnic cleansing and the acts of violence whose origins lay in racial hatred .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
Organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
The root causes of global conflicts had been aggravated by ethnic , religious and intercommunal divisions , which required a just and lasting radical solution in order to ensure that desperation and insecurity did not lead to insurmountable social crises .  
Hungary strongly condemned the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq , where the Government was implicated in summary executions , political killings , systematic torture and the repression of ethnic and religious minorities .  
Hungary remained extremely concerned about continuing human rights violations , including extrajudicial and summary executions , widespread detention , torture , forced labour and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities .  
There is no doubt that humanitarian law has been violated and that cultural monuments have been destroyed by all three parties in the tragic civil , ethnic and religious war in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
The representative informed the members of the Committee that , in April 1993 , the maximum period for suspension of a radio or television broadcasting permit , referred to in paragraph 28 of the report , had been increased from one year to five years .  Updating the figures contained in paragraph 45 of the report , the representative informed the Committee that , in 1992 , five persons had been convicted of agitating against an ethnic group , and two of illegal discrimination .  
They emphasized the fact that the Moroccan nation was historically and constitutionally a single indivisible whole , but they wondered why censuses and studies carried out by the authorities employed only socio-economic and not racial , ethnic or linguistic criteria , which would give a more complete idea of the composition of the population .  
High levels of poverty and unemployment , lack of distributive justice , social unrest arising from ethnic , cultural and minority differences and powerful vested interests that need to be contained remain barriers , and these must be addressed continuously and simultaneously .  
They justify the drafting of new international instruments to complete the existing legal arsenal , so that those who continue to perpetrate cruel and inhuman acts , genocide and ethnic cleansing can be punished .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
We have come to realize the growing importance of effective regional tools in addressing this new type of mostly internal conflicts , where the rule of law and accountable national administrations are often non-existent , where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders lead campaigns of intimidation , ethnic cleansing and genocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade 's ambition to create a Greater Serbia inspired by the philosophy of national chauvinism , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the forceful changing of borders lies at the centre of the present-day Balkan crisis , concentrated in the former Yugoslavia . 
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .  
Although numerous resolutions of the Security Council reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia , confirming the inadmissibility of the annexation of territory by force and condemning ethnic cleansing have been adopted , the reaction of the international community to the challenge posed by the Serbs has always been hesitant and confused .  
Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed the overwhelming majority black population with a heavy legacy of poverty , social disintegration and political cleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities .  
The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis strongly condemns the outrageous and cowardly acts of genocide , ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate killing of the innocent and helpless , on all sides in this brutal conflict .  
At the same time , though , there is a growing danger of armed conflicts breaking out because of continuing economic , political , territorial , ethnic , religious and other imbalances in relations between States .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
However , the threats of a world cataclysm have grown over decades of regional and local conflicts , stirred up by a wide range of motives involving geopolitical , economic and trading disputes as well as ethnic and religious conflicts .  
None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
However , the lack of political will to suppress aggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with United Nations decisions , coupled with the unreasonable , immoral and legally baseless insistence by some on extending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the Serbs that they can continue with impunity their murder , destruction , aggression , ethnic cleansing and genocide .  
The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
No sooner had bloc confrontation and tension decreased than the international community started to face a dramatic increase of tension and conflict based on ethnic , racial , religious or national prejudice - tension which thrived on rekindling or reviving animosities that had been extinguished or dormant for many , many years . 
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
We see with great concern how ethnic , geographical and utopian myths and revisionisms are becoming a boundless source of suffering for millions of men and women in our time , gravely disturbing fragile international balances .  
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
The National Working Committee on Children and Women , established under the State Council for monitoring the NPA , will mobilize leaders at key administrative levels to strengthen programme delivery , allocate adequate resources , support local mobilization action and monitor implementation of the NPA . 59 .  In poor counties and ethnic minority areas , empowerment activities will be adapted to the local culture , knowledge and needs .  
She referred to the latest report of the Special Rapporteur , which confirmed the persistence of grave human rights violations , the systematic and daily slaughter of innocent people , the odious practice of ethnic cleansing and forced resettlement , even in the so-called " security " zones .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Recognize and respect cultural , ethnic and religious diversity , and promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities ; and take measures to facilitate their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and social development in their country ;  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
In particular , the United States indicated that it understands that the term " intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group as such " , as used in the Convention , means the " specific intent to destroy , in whole or substantial part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group as such " by the acts prohibited in the Convention .  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
In spite of some notable progress in democratization and popular participation in some African countries , a number of others remain embroiled in ethnic conflicts , political upheavals and civil wars which have resulted in a humanitarian tragedy of unprecedented proportions .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;  
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
Having been instigated by Belgrade to serve as an instrument in a genocidal campaign against their neighbours and having been influenced by an incessant anti-Croatian propaganda campaign from Belgrade , many of these ethnic Serbs - even though most are not personally responsible for the crimes committed - have decided to leave rather than face their surviving neighbours who are returning to live in the region .  
The United Nations must never again permit itself to be reduced to a passive observer or , even worse , an obedient assistant to the Pale regime in their final act of ethnic cleansing .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
The Government of the Republic of Croatia is concerned that the magnitude of the human rights abuses against ethnic Croats in the " Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) " as well as in the remaining occupied territories of Croatia and in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Serbs will increase and that this can only raise tensions and hinder the establishment of a lasting peace in the region .  
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
The declaration on the historical reconciliation between Romania and Hungary may be accompanied by a juridical bilateral document laying down the mechanisms and instruments , as well as a code of conduct on issues of ethnic minorities , which the two countries would agree to establish in order to attain these goals , as well as by concrete programmes of action at political , economic , strategic , cultural levels , and in other fields of common interest .

The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Urge the identification and condemnation of the systematic practice of rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women as a deliberate instrument of war and ethnic cleansing and take steps to ensure that full assistance is provided to the victims of such abuse for their physical and mental rehabilitation ;  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
" We have promoted racial understanding , and sought to guarantee to everyone , without distinction as to race , colour , national or ethnic origin , the right to equality before the law in civil , political and economic rights .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
States should be less restrictive and more liberal in the granting of visas to nationals of countries of the South and call on their populations to be more receptive to foreigners and to cultural interchange .  181 .  In the short term , as the United Nations strives for peace on several fronts , radical measures are urgently needed to curb radio stations that promote ethnic or racial hatred and to suppress clandestine radio stations which engage in such activities .

In this multidimensional context , the question of the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities is of overriding importance for the respect of human rights generally and central to the promotion of understanding , tolerance and solidarity between and among communities and Governments .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .

However , health and educational services remain impaired by continuous ethnic turmoil , forcing the international community to set up parallel administrative structures .  
In practical terms , the campaign against racism and xenophobia must be carried out by developing educational programmes , punishing those responsible for such practices , opening up new opportunities for members of racial and ethnic minorities and ensuring , at all levels , respect for human dignity .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .  
In his country , whose population reflected an ethnic mixture created by successive waves of migrants , his Government had systematically extended moral , political and material support to all peoples struggling against racial discrimination and apartheid .  
After having undertaken a drastic policy of ethnic cleansing against Serbs , the Croatian authorities are already calling into question the Serbs ' right to be represented in Parliament , the Government , regional and other authorities because for that aspect of political life they do not fulfil the new condition of representing the prescribed 8 per cent in Croatia 's total population .

The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
It is expected of the international community to respond to the biggest ethnic cleansing carried out so far in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , following Croatia 's brutal aggression against the Serb Krajina and after joint Muslim-Croat attacks on traditionally Serb ethnic territories in western and north-western Bosnia , even after a cease-fire agreement was announced .

note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
The serious and massive occurrence of discriminatory and repressive practices aimed at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as a whole , resulting in widespread involuntary migration ; and noting also that the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolutions 1993 / 9 of 20 August 1993 and 1995 / 10 of 18 August 1995 , considered that those measures and practices constituted a form of ethnic cleansing ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,

BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
With a population of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic and linguistic origins , 80 per cent of whom live in rural settings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600 kilometres of ocean , no other system is workable .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
With regard to the situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , double standards were evident , with certain countries demanding air strikes in retaliation for ethnic cleansing committed by one side , while turning a blind eye to identical acts committed by the other sides .  
In a climate of growing radicalization , extremists from the two main ethnic groups in the country are engaged in a round of violence that includes selective killings , massacres of civilians and the destruction of national economic assets and infrastructure .  
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .

In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .

[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]

The key elements of the plan included an agreed ratio of IPTF to Federation police in the various areas ; the issuance of special identity cards for Federation police authorized and cleared by IPTF ; a change in the composition of the Federation police in each suburb to reflect the ethnic mix of the population according to the 1991 census ; IPTF authorization of Federation police check-points ; and requests in advance for searches of houses or private property .  
The closed nature of ethnic communal groups , enhanced by language barriers and an often imported distrust of the police , make immigrant communities in many countries ideal recruiting and operating grounds for criminal organizations .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Urge all those involved in the implementation process to undertake urgent and effective measures to stop the tendency of ethnic partition of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and draw the attention of the international community to the serious threat to the stability of the entire Balkan region as a result of the prevailing tendency to support ethnic instead of democratic forces ;  
The two sides are in favour of the continued promotion of friendly exchanges among the people of various countries so as to enhance mutual understanding and confidence , and are against stirring up national , ethnic and religious conflicts .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requests the heads of diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations to report objectively about what they have seen to the Governments , nations or organizations that they represent and give them an accurate account of what is taking place in Burundi : recognized crimes against innocent populations , women , children and defenceless patients can not be mistaken for a struggle for democracy or the liberation of an ethnic group , or presented simply as inter-ethnic confrontation or fighting between the army and the rebels .  
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .

Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
Communal violence , understood as acts of violence committed by one ethnic , religious , linguistic , national or social group against another group , was reported in Bangladesh , Burundi , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Mali , Nigeria and Somalia . Government forces are often said to support one side in the conflict or even instigate hostilities , rather than intervene to stop violence between different groups .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;

For human rights education not to be theoretical , but to be relevant to people 's experience and , therefore , rooted in the historical , social , psychological , ethnic , gender , linguistic and other contexts of the learners ;  
The Government of Mauritius stated that the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities were guaranteed through a combination of constitutional provisions , which were fully compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , statutory legislation and common law .  
The Government of Austria reported that ethnic groups were represented at the national level by ethnic councils whose aim it was to further the collective cultural , social and economic interests of the various ethnic groups in Austria .  
In addition , a special State programme had been drawn up to address the cultural , spiritual , educational and socio-economic problems of the 12-million ethnic Ukrainians living abroad .  
It was emphasized that the establishment and maintenance of unimpeded contacts among persons belonging to a national minority , as well as contacts across frontiers by persons belonging to a national minority with persons with whom they share a common ethnic or national origin , cultural heritage or religious belief , contributes to mutual understanding and promotes good neighbourly relations .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
Those included activities using the education for development approach in the areas of advocacy and training ; research studies by the International Child Development Centre in Florence , Italy ; workshops that addressed issues of religious , ethnic and cultural discrimination ; and dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the public in numerous local languages .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The seminar recognized that it is vital that States Members of the United Nations promote awareness of the threat posed to the stability of national and international order by the propagation of ethnic hatred , ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin , and by racist propaganda and activities .  
The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
A penal component , prohibiting any racial , ethnic or religious discrimination against an individual or community and strengthening the penalties to be handed down on conviction for racist offences by adding deprivation of civil rights for 5 to 10 years ;  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
Because of the short time-frame and the higher level of technical skill required , prior experience was found to be necessary , and a total of 62 men of different ethnic backgrounds were employed .  
In addition , the authorities have repeatedly stated their commitment to equality and non-discrimination , and it was apparent in the discussions of the Representative with government officials at both the central and local level that they were making efforts to ensure that the law was being applied to persons of all ethnic groups in an equal manner .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
Mr . BAALI ( Algeria ) said that the origin of the dramatic events currently taking place in the world lay , even more than in colonialism and the disintegration of communism , in the resurgence of violence provoked by the exacerbation of nationalistic , ethnic , religious and tribal sentiments and fed by foreign intervention . 
Moreover , the willingness and psychological capacity of the developed countries to provide asylum and support were diminishing ; that had been reflected in decreased aid and an increase in restrictive practices that circumscribed the right of asylum , particularly if persons happened to be from different ethnic or cultural backgrounds . 
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
Resurgent nationalism and the rejection of religious , cultural , ethnic and ideological diversity were being expressed in ethnic conflict , growing violence and the proliferation of racist and xenophobic practices in various parts of the world .  
He was satisfied with the definition of crimes against humanity , which was based on the notion that there was no nexus between that category of crimes and a state of war , and was especially pleased that institutionalized discrimination on racial , ethnic or religious grounds was included in that category . 
The United States had also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; the latter should be a very valuable tool as the international community responded to humanitarian and human rights crises born of racial and ethnic animosities .  
While the international community was giving considerable attention to the promotion and protection of human rights , and while the international and regional human rights mechanisms had therefore gained in effectiveness , it nevertheless had to be recognized that much more needed to be done to check the wave of reported and noted violations , especially in view of the geopolitical instability , regional and ethnic conflicts and recent social turmoil .  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
As regards the Greek Cypriot side 's self-portrayal as the victimized party in the Cyprus question , I wish to underline that there is ample graphic evidence in the form of reports by the Secretary-General and the international press that during the years between 1963 and 1974 a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing was directed by the Greek Cypriots against their former Turkish Cypriot partners in Cyprus .  
Regrettably , the world continued to be confronted by civil strife , ethnic cleansing , lawlessness and extreme poverty , all of which posed a considerable challenge to the full enjoyment of human rights .  
Relevant disaggregated information ( for example , by gender , age , region , rural / urban areas and social and ethnic origin ) should be given on children having benefited from any of these measures and resources allocated to them ( at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels ) .

Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Please provide information on the measures adopted , including at the legislative , administrative , educational , budgetary and social levels , to ensure that a child belonging to an ethnic , religious or linguistic minority or who is indigenous is not denied the right , in community with other members of his or her group :  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
The main principles of his Government 's policy in that area were to ensure equality of constitutional rights and freedoms to all citizens , to strengthen legal safeguards against discrimination , extremism and intolerance , to promote mutual trust among ethnic groups and respect for their language and cultures , and to create conditions that would enable all citizens to express their ethnic , cultural and religious identities freely . 
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
With regard to racial discrimination , his delegation naturally condemned racial violence , xenophobia and racism , but could not accept a failure to take account of the flagrant violations of the rights of peoples represented by colonialism , foreign occupation , genocide , ethnic cleansing , and the hatred voiced of Arabs , Africans , Asians and the peoples of Latin America , all issues which were not broached in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance .

Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
In the face of reassertion of ethnic - some may call it tribal - identities , of revival of neo-liberal ideas based on extreme individualism and deregulation , as well as of other centrifugal forces , it becomes imperative at the international level to insist on general , as opposed to particular , State interests and to work towards the development of a public order of the international community .  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
The new , restructured MINUGUA will oversee an unprecedented transformation in the political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security life of Guatemala .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
Unfortunately , in our world there remain conflicts , violence , ethnic strife , religious intolerance , terrorism , drug trafficking , corruption , poverty , unjust international economic relations and a heavy external debt that continues to prove overwhelming .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
Throughout the past few years , successive world events have indicated that disasters caused by people resorting to armed force in their ethnic , civil , ideological or border wars have been increasing in a manner unprecedented in modern history .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
Furthermore , in areas inhabited by a considerable number ( one quarter ) of members of an ethnic group , designations and inscriptions of a topographical nature set up by territorial authorities and public agencies must be bilingual .  
In specifically identified primary and secondary compulsory schools located in the traditional area of settlement of an ethnic group , this right is ensured for every member of the ethnic minority regardless of the number of pupils participating , and in primary and secondary compulsory schools located outside the traditional settlement area minority language instruction is provided where there is a demand , requiring a minimum number of participants which varies between four and nine .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
Each of the High Contracting Parties guarantees to nationals of the other Parties resident in its territory , regardless of their ethnic affiliation , religion or other differences , social , economic and cultural rights and freedoms in accordance with universally accepted international human rights standards .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .

Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities , Gravely concerned about reports that these practices have frequently been carried out by agents under government authority or have taken place with the knowledge of the Government of the Sudan ,  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Before the astonished eyes of a silent public , we have in recent years been able to " see " the gravest violations of the right to life for ethnic and racial motives , death from hunger in atrocious conditions of thousands upon thousands of children and people of all ages , in short , atrocities that in the old world with less intercommunication only came to be known many years later through books and distant reports , and were sometimes never known at all by the public .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
Equal attention was being paid to the renaissance and free development of the Ukrainian nation and to the promotion and protection of the spiritual and cultural heritage of other ethnic , linguistic and religious groups living in Ukraine .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
We hope that the OSCE mission in Bosnia will continue to work in close contact with relevant United Nations structures and specialized agencies in resolving such vital matters as protection of the rights of ethnic minorities , the problems of refugees , and the normal functioning of municipal authorities .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
Although pre _ colonial Rwanda was inhabited by the same peoples as are found there today , namely , the Hutus ( of Bantu origin ) , the Tutsi ( of Hamitic descent ) and the Twas ( pymoid type ) , these three peoples , organized in more or less autonomous kingdoms , did not constitute opposing dominant and dominated ethnic groups . 
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
We , the representatives of the Serbian ethnic community , are convinced that in the sense of the aforementioned we have not even hypothesized a possibility of diminishing or limiting the relevant civil rights of the present and future inhabitants of the region under the Transitional Administration in the Republic of Croatia .  
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
All Sudanese citizens living in areas controlled by the Government of the Sudan are potential victims of human rights violations and abuses , regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic origin or social status , once they are considered to be opponents of the Government of the Sudan , or even suspected of being in disagreement with its political agenda .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
It should be noted that while ethnic and religious identities have not played a significant role in the conflict , there has been a feeling in the northern and central parts of the country that their economic and cultural interests have been neglected by the Government .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The entire northern third of the country is hostile to Islamabad , and the more the northern forces continue their advance into Taliban-controlled territory , the greater will be the destabilizing consequences for Pakistan , already fragile and vulnerable from guns , drugs , corruption , ethnic killings and religious conflict . 
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .  
Many governmental representatives also stated that it is not necessary to arrive at a universal definition of indigenous peoples in the context of the draft United Nations declaration , although some Governments recognized the concerns of countries with complex ethnic and historical circumstances .  
In order to ensure democracy and human rights for all Afghan men and women , irrespective of religious , racial , ethnic and / or linguistic differences , based upon the recognized principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other related internationally accepted covenants in line with the tenets of Islamic Law ,  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
It can not be overemphasized that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race , colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples as well as the harmony of people living side by side even within the same State .  
In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
Membership in the national society was generally defined by citizenship , which should be extended liberally to all who had made the State their permanent home , without distinction on racial , ethnic , religious or linguistic grounds .  
Cases referred to included : the Hungarian minority in Slovakia , where in schools of the national minorities , history and geography was taught by ethnic Slovak teachers , which allegedly led to a distortion of historical truth and thus negatively affected future generations of Hungarians learning about their own past ( Federal Union of European Nationalities ) ; the Arab minority in Israel , where educational guidelines and policies were designed to entrench the values of the Jewish culture , and the characteristics of the identity of the Palestinian minority were suppressed .  
During the discussions particular attention was paid to the positive role of the media as an instrument for the protection and promotion of the rights of persons belonging to minorities , as well as to the negative role the media could play by exacerbating problems involving minorities and latent ethnic , religious or racial tensions .  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Civil peace and security are endangered by the combined impact of various forms of violence and conflict between ethnic , religious , linguistic and other groups , the rise of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism , of fanaticism and fundamentalism of different kinds , of terrorism and organized crime , exclusion and discrimination directed against vulnerable groups within societies , proceeding from a culture of violence and war .  
A strengthened rule of law is essential to safeguarding basic freedoms , protecting ethnic and religious minorities , promoting Government accountability and providing social stability and the legal framework necessary for economic development .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .  
Committed to the full development of human potential within just and inclusive societies attentive to the promotion of harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups ;  
Conflict , whether at the international , State , or community level , can be considered a natural , inevitable consequence of differing interests , goals or values which may be exacerbated by ethnic , racial , cultural and linguistic differences .  
Education should enable the individual to live and work in a free society , and should promote mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
The wars in the former Yugoslavia were marked by horrendous crimes against international humanitarian law , often committed in the name of that repulsive policy , ethnic cleansing .  
The Committee expresses concern that in view of the complex ethnic and religious composition of the population of Croatia , the report does not include statistical information on the social , economic and political standing of minority women .  
That the accused intended to deprive an identifiable group of persons of life , liberty or security of person because of the target group 's political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural or religious affiliation ;  
It is now time for the international community to be more united and determined to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to find a peaceful and workable solution to calm the situation and to resolve the conflict in Kosovo .  
The key element of the crime of genocide is the specific intent on the part of the perpetrator to physically destroy , in whole or in part , a protected group , namely a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group .  
The Conference should examine the psychological , social , political and economic factors that made individuals receptive to racism , in view of forecasts concerning future ethnic and racial conflict .  
The periodic reports of the Secretary-General and of the international press provide ample graphic evidence of a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people during that period .  
In addition to the more obvious manifestations , developing countries practised more subtle forms of racial discrimination through immigration laws based on ethnic and regional considerations .  
Respect for human rights and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities constituted a firm basis for peaceful coexistence , dialogue , mutual understanding and tolerance .  
Her Government recognized and encouraged the cultural and ethnic diversity of modern Australia and had recently enacted legislation to prohibit offensive or intimidating public behaviour based on race .  
The claim that the Serbian authorities pursue an open policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing supported by brutal military and police action against innocent Albanian civilians is both untrue and ludicrous .  
In the chapeau , her delegation was in favour of the words widespread and systematic and the words on political , philosophical , racial , ethnic or religious grounds or any other arbitrarily defined grounds .  
While habitual residence constituted a very close link between a natural person and a State , there were also ethnic , linguistic , religious , cultural , social and political factors which were often very important in the case of succession of States .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
It appears that if the pattern of results of the first round is maintained , each of the main political parties will have drawn overwhelming support for the ethnic and regional base of their leaders .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
It is intolerable for fundamental principles of international humanitarian law to be violated , that minimal protection is not provided to civilians and non-combatants and that people are forcibly displaced for ethnic or religious reasons .  
The existence of many internal armed conflicts , some of them attributable to ethnic mistrust and resistance , which extend to the regional level and in which the warring parties resort to the hiring of mercenaries to boost their military potential ;  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
Education must offer the individual the opportunity to live and work in a free society , and must foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
It is the mission of culture and science to enable individuals to live in a free society , and to foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
Conflicts based on ethnic , religious or cultural grounds are still emerging in many parts of our planet , claiming innocent lives and precious resources , while the race in military expenditures knows no bounds .  
The political parties bear the mark of mistrust ( they may not join any international organizations ) ; English is introduced as a national language , although unknown to non _ Tutsi ethnic groups ; the problem of the nationality of the Banyamulenge and relocated peoples remains unresolved ; and the Supreme Council of Justice is replaced by a Haute Autorit Judiciaire , headed by the President of the Republic .  
In an era when ethnic conflict and civil war have become increasingly common in comparison to international armed conflicts , the responsibility of a new Government to pay for past violations may require a specific guiding principle , which should be incorporated in the guidelines .  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
In many countries currently engulfed by war and internal conflict , adjustment-induced social unrest provided the initial impetus for ethnic , tribal , religious fundamentalist and nationalist frenzy which eventually led to armed conflict . 
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Calls upon the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to revoke all discriminatory legislation and to apply all other legislation without discrimination against any ethnic , national , religious or linguistic group , to ensure the speedy and consistent investigation of acts of discrimination and violence against refugees and internally displaced persons , and to ensure the arrest and punishment of those responsible for acts of discrimination and violence ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
To respect fully all the rights of individuals in Kosovo , whatever their ethnic , cultural or religious backgrounds , so as to guarantee equitable treatment of their values and historic patrimony and so as to preserve and permit expression of their national , cultural , religious and linguistic identities in accordance with international standards and the Final Act of Helsinki of 1 August 1975 ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Such a commitment could strengthen resect for the human rights of all and promote the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , in particular , key elements for peaceful coexistence , mutual understanding and tolerance among societies and the international community .  
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
Popular and / or politically driven anti-foreigner sentiment based on racial , ethnic , national or religious characteristics is a strong obstacle both to recognition of and respect for the human rights of migrants .  
The requisite intent has support in direct and indirect evidence , including Khmer Rouge statements , eyewitness accounts and the nature and number of victims in each group , both in absolute terms and in proportion to each group 's total population . 12 These groups qualify as protected groups under the Convention : the Muslim Cham as an ethnic and religious group ; the Vietnamese communities as an ethnic and , perhaps , a racial group ; and the Buddhist monkhood as a religious group . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico is firmly convinced that the preferred means of settling a conflict must be dialogue and negotiation , and it therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
The Rio Group therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a comprehensive and final settlement with a view to re-establishing a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups and minorities in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
In this context , the OIC Contact Group lends full support to the Secretary-General for his initiatives and diplomatic efforts in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons under international protection throughout Kosova . * Reissued for technical reasons .  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
In that context , it continued to be concerned about the damaging effects of armed conflict on Afghan children , who were the victims of incessant hostilities and abhorrent treatment by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
We wish to recall the declaration of the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group , held in Geneva on 7 April 1999 ; to confirm our strong condemnation of the policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Serbian authorities against the Albanian Kosovars ; and to demand an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities and the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
Since the arbitrary termination of the autonomy of Kosovo by the Belgrade authorities in 1989 , we , together with the international community , have watched with great distress the Serbian acts of atrocities against the innocent and hard-working people of Kosovo and the campaigns of ethnic cleansing that have been reminiscent of the preceding sinister acts against the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina that were also committed by the Serbs .  
In Nairobi , the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by his meeting with Sudanese women of various ethnic , religious and political backgrounds who , within their respective organizations and through the implementation of different projects involving and empowering women at the grass-roots level , are making their own valuable contribution towards the common goal of peace-making and building in the Sudan .  
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
It is in this framework and with these purposes in mind that Hungary expresses its strong desire to live side by side with a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at peace with its ethnic communities , respectful of all human rights , including the rights of national minorities , and thus ready to rejoin the community of nations .  
Albania highly appreciates the irreplaceable role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , which stopped one of the greatest human catastrophes in Europe after the Second World War and which brought to a halt the genocide and the ethnic cleansing carried out against millions of innocent Albanian civilians in the heart of Europe , thereby protecting the best values of our world civilization .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
The policies of structural adjustment pursued in the 1980s probably contributed in many places to intensified tension between the different ethnic , racial or social groups in society , and may have had enormous cost in terms of lost development opportunities and may have hampered many groups in their enjoyment of the right to food . 
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
From our point of view , the crisis in the Balkans should encourage the international community to seek a better understanding of the extreme importance of joint activities , within the framework of decisions taken by United Nations bodies , towards the settlement of ethnic conflicts by peaceful means in order to maintain peace , protect human rights and provide an opportunity to every person for the unhampered achievement of his or her human and spiritual potential .  
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
The improvement of the overall human rights situation would require the emergence of a framework for building peace through an inclusive participatory process involving continuing consultations with all segments of the Afghan people , aimed at establishing a broad _ based , multi _ ethnic and fully representative government .  
In order to build a firm foundation for real and enduring peace and security , it was essential to eliminate the root causes of conflict , be they of a political , ethnic , economic , social or other nature .  
In this context , the requests of the members of the Albanian ethnic national minority and KFOR to be granted full control over the Inland Revenue Office , the registry of immovable property , vital records books and other registry books that constitute a legal foundation for the exercise of the rights of citizens on the basis of ownership of both movable and immovable property are also unlawful .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party and further recommends that it increase measures to reduce economic and social disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The factors driving these conflicts which the Seminar identified showed why internal conflicts clearly predominate : ethnic rivalries , general decline in the rule of law , democratic shortcomings on the part of the political authorities , defective governance policies , poverty and underdevelopment , identity-based political demands , politicization of ethnicity , shortcomings in reintegrating former combatants , lack of access to agricultural land , economic difficulties and other factors .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
To help bring this issue to a just and lasting resolution , the Chinese Government offers encouragement and support to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan so that they can put the interests of their nation and country above everything else , disregard their ethnic , religious and political differences , stop fighting among themselves as soon as possible and establish a broad-based and stable government acceptable to all sides , on the basis of mutual respect and extensive consultations .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Police restructuring involves reducing the number of excess police and ensuring that the rationalized police forces are representative of the ethnic composition of the community they serve and that they work within legitimate , transparent , accountable and professional organizational structures .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
This is a professional body that is trained to focus on the protection and defence of the individual and collective rights of citizens and is sensitive to , and respectful of , ethnic , cultural and linguistic diversities . 
Considering the care that has been shown by the ruling party to grant citizenship , and thus voting rights , to the " diaspora " ( ethnic Croats who live abroad ) , the Special Rapporteur places special emphasis on the rights of all those who qualify for Croatian citizenship , irrespective of ethnicity , and especially refugees , to claim citizenship in a timely manner , thus enabling them to participate in the forthcoming Croatian elections .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
Additionally , the legacy of the Kosovo crisis upon the federal authorities , when the international community , led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , intervened in order to halt ethnic cleansing , has not encouraged the scheduling of formal bilateral meetings .  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
Among them are an elected Government that enjoys widespread legitimacy within the population a rare fact in the aftermath of a war ; a strong and active civil society ; a fabric of national cohesion , without significant polarization along ethnic or religious lines ; a land endowed with rich soil and considerable mineral resources ; and a tradition of higher education .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Discrimination based on race , colour , ethnic or national origin , xenophobia , religious hatred or intolerance is an increasing phenomenon in Europe and was perceived by participants as a potential source of conflict . 
These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
The Ministers emphasize that resolute opposition to terrorists sheltering behind political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic and religious slogans is in no way aimed at discrimination against any one of those causes .  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The achievement of the ambitious but realistic goals of the International Decade of the Worlds Indigenous People would not only solve specific problems faced by indigenous peoples but would also make a substantial contribution to the peaceful coexistence of nations , national minorities and ethnic groups .  
Her delegation had always stressed the need to classify ethnic groups in order to facilitate national policies on the rights of national minorities and indigenous people , and believed that the draft declaration should make a distinction between two categories of indigenous groups , those leading a tribal way of life on isolated reservations and those integrated with the rest of society .  
As a moral and pluralistic society , Indonesia was committed to promoting respect for human rights and taking into account the varied cultural , ethnic and religious composition of the nation , as provided for in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action .  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Mr . Tekle ( Eritrea ) said that since Ethiopia had begun its systematic violation of the human rights of Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin , it had deported close to 70,000 of them on ethnic grounds , confined 2,000 in harsh concentration camps , was responsible for the disappearance of 1,500 more and deprived 15,000 others of both jobs and housing without allowing them to emigrate .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The effect on developing countries includes reduced economic investments , more decaying neighbourhoods and fewer government resources allotted to essential social development programmes such as education , health and programmes promoting gender and ethnic equality .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
These grounds are : sex ; marital status ; religious belief ; ethical belief ; colour , race , ethnic or national origin ( which includes nationality or citizenship ) ; disability ; age ; political opinion ; employment status ; family status ; or sexual orientation .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
In the weeks that followed , members of ethnic minority groups , especially Roma and Serbs , began fleeing Kosovo owing to fear of the killings , kidnapping , looting of properties , evictions , widespread burning of villages , as well as cultural , historical and religious monuments , and other forms of intimidation directed against them.The situation of the Serb , Roma and other minority communities has been a painful one of widespread human rights violations . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
The norms and principles of international law are interconnected and interdependent , and they constitute an integral system designed to bar humanitarian disasters and ethnic cleansing , as well as acts of aggression .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
As we prepare to enter the twenty-first century , and cognizant of the challenges that will confront our continent and peoples , we emphasize the imperative need and a high sense of urgency to rekindle the aspirations of our peoples for stronger unity , solidarity and cohesion in a larger community of peoples transcending cultural , ideological , ethnic and national differences .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
The Committee regrets that its dialogue with representatives of the State party regarding the root causes of the armed conflict was inconclusive ; the absence in the report of statistics relating to the north and east of the country can only reinforce the view of the Committee that the question of discrimination in relation to the economic , social and cultural rights of ethnic groups remains the central issue in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .  
In its report the Team presented the preliminary conclusion that the systematic massacre of those Rwandan Hutus ] remaining in Zaire was an abhorrent crime against humanity , but the underlying rationale for the decisions is material to whether these killings constituted genocide , that is to eliminate , in part , the Hutu ethnic group .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
Anyone who , either orally , through the medium of the press or any document or representation , or by any other means , publicly expresses ideas that are offensive to any individual or group of individuals by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 500 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
Anyone whose profession consists in supplying goods or services who refuses to serve an individual solely by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , or who sets conditions relating to racial or ethnic origin or religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 400 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
In a climate of ethnic intolerance and total disrespect for international law , UNPROFOR earlier and the High Representative later ensured that fair , objective , tolerant radio and television as well as newspapers received adequate international support , while broadcasting licences for other stations were withdrawn , and the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) took control of transmitters when necessary .  
Mr . AL-BUSAIDY ( Oman ) said that he looked forward to the establishment of an international criminal court which would help to put an end to bloodshed and prosecute those responsible for such heinous crimes as ethnic cleansing , aggression , genocide , torture and the forcible transfer of defenceless civilians .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
In turn , directing international assistance to support decentralized and locally owned activities on behalf of all affected parties can help in regenerating war-torn communities and in promoting national reconciliation by inducing beneficiaries from different ethnic groups to work together towards a common future .  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
Mr . Oron ( Israel ) , speaking on agenda item 114 , said that , although hybrid ethnic and national identities had become part of the social landscape , they had not yet become the rule and were all too often accompanied by overt manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
The new text stated not only that discrimination on grounds of race , age , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , sexual orientation , disability or state of health was prohibited , but also that the State would grant special protection to persons who were at a disadvantage for any of those reasons and would punish those responsible for violations committed against such persons .  
Such personal networks hide behind consensual agreements , justified by political , social , ethnic and religious arguments , so that it is difficult for the public to become aware of them .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
The safe , voluntary and dignified return of refugees and displaced persons is essential to reverse the consequences of ethnic cleansing and to heal , as far as possible , the deep and festering wounds that it caused during the long years of war .  
We need societies where every single individual regardless of social status , gender , disability or ethnic or religious background is empowered to influence his or her living conditions for a better future .  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .  
That the Government introduce political endeavour and supporting resources to address the systemic barriers and social attitudes standing in the way of the realization of human rights by the ethnic and religious minorities ;  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 [ of art .  7 ] , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
Discrimination based on racial , social , ethnic , economic , and even geographical and language considerations , is not only very palpable in the attitudes of the ordinary people in the streets , it is also very clearly present in government policies .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
Thus , the recognition that UNMIK has been incompetent ( or unwilling ) to halt the final stages of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Metohija and to establish civil administration is revealed in all its devastating brutality .  
On the other hand , mountainous countries and regions are populated by numerous ethnic groups and peoples whose traditional socioeconomic lifestyle enables them to adapt to and organize their vital activities in harsh living conditions .  
Terms like ethnic minority , ethnic conflict , immigration restrictions , new immigrant , illegal alien , urban poor and colourblindness , are used to deny or obscure the racist aspects of certain social behaviours or government policies .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
This requires sustained educational and proactive initiatives in those various sectors at the community level which are geared towards promoting harmonious social relations between different ethnic groups .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
The old world order has been replaced by new local conflicts in which political and economic factors cut across historical , religious , ethnic or nationalistic lines .  
The episodes of ethnic cleansing committed throughout the history of humanity were intended to harm both the racial , religious and cultural identity of a group or people , at times its very physical existence .  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
To make such forms available and accessible to every child , providing inter alia any relevant disaggregated data including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , coverage and budgetary allocation ;  
To introduce free secondary education and offer financial assistance in case of need , indicating the children concerned , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , and national , social and ethnic origin , and the budget allocated for that purpose ;  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .  
Although moderate forces were successful in the municipal elections held in April in Bosnia and Herzegovina , the nationalist parties continue to dominate the political life of the country , which remains divided along ethnic lines .  
The States concerned reaffirmed that terrorist acts were in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
Democracy in Kosovo must begin to take root , but given Kosovos troubled history , institutionalizing the sharing of administrative and political responsibility between the ethnic communities concerned will not be quick or easy .  
Our view is that they are in fact arcane and immoral , with the leadership of both institutions confined to a royal family of select individuals who must meet the criterion of regional indeed ethnic origin . 
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Statute defines the forcible transfer of the children of a threatened national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another group as genocide , while rape and sexual slavery are classified as both war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
He said India , which had over a-billion inhabitants and constituted a real ethnic , linguistic and religious patchwork , had chosen an economic , social and political model which was unique for a former colony with development problems .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
It is not an ethnic , tribal or religious conflict , but one born of greed and the desire by a handful of unpatriotic elements to control the strategic mineral and natural resources of the country .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The refugee issue was not new , but it was compounded by the complexity of the situation in the countries and regions involved , with communities often divided by religious and ethnic hatreds , governance and public security lacking , and poverty widespread .  
The history of our countries in the decade just past has been marked by a plethora of bloody national and civil conflicts and an unprecedented intensification of ethnic , political and social enmity , xenophobia and alienation .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
Additionally , the triangle has embarked on a policy of social engineering with the aim of changing the demographic composition of various provinces of Afghanistan through the relocation and dislocation of the native inhabitants of central and northern parts of Afghanistan in order to disturb the harmonious fraternal coexistence of Afghan ethnic groups , which has endured for hundreds of years .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
In our view , the seeds of civil strife can invariably be found in places where Governments lack legitimacy , where governance is weak or unrepresentative , where irrational values such as fundamentalism , racism , tribalism , ethnic discrimination , social injustice , and violation of human rights are practised officially or unofficially .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
We pay tribute to the efforts of Djibouti and its President for their tireless efforts leading to the convening of the Somalia National Peace Conference in Arta , where , for the first time , a sound and correct foundation was laid for achieving consensus among 5,000 Somalis representing all social , religious , ethnic and regional factions throughout Somalia .  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
Combating terrorism was one of the priorities for the member States of the group of Azerbaijan , Georgia , Republic of Moldova , Ukraine and Uzbekistan , as indicated in the statement of 24 April 1999 , contained in document A / 54 / 94 , in which the Presidents of those States had expressed their concern at the increased number of acts of terrorism , recognized the necessity to combat terrorism in all its manifestations and decided to spare no effort in the fight against ethnic intolerance , separatism , religious extremism and terrorism . 
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
In the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups for instance indigenous people , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with HIV / AIDS .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
The Committee is also concerned that the State party has not taken measures to address discrimination against children who are born out of wedlock , those affected by HIV / AIDS , children in remote rural areas , children born of incestuous relationships , institutionalized children , pregnant girls , children with disabilities , street children and children of ethnic minority groups .  
Particular attention should be paid by the discussions under both sub-themes to the position and special vulnerability of children who have been marginalized or discriminated against on the basis of their ethnic origin of economic status who can be , for example , singled out in schools for bullying or degrading treatment by teachers or be more vulnerable to violence within the family that escapes detection by the normal monitoring systems ( for example for families that are homeless or illegal migrants ) .  
We voice our satisfaction in this regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina has acquired an elected Council of Ministers , whose main objective is to undertake basic reforms on all levels , particularly by advancing the noble values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among all the ethnic groups .  
In doing so , I recalled the expectations of the international community for rapid progress by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian Governments on the implementation of the political , economic and social confidence-building measures set out in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian plan for the region , independent of other progress in negotiations with the ethnic Albanian representatives .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Reaffirm that the discriminatory treatment of foreigners and migrant workers established or practised in certain countries , inter alia concerning granting visas , work permits , conditions of family members , housing and access to justice , based on race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin , are human rights violations which seriously contradict the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families ;  
Even after signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement , the Ethiopian hordes had wilfully , wantonly and methodically launched indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets , taken prisoners , tortured , raped and murdered , attacked and destroyed villages , public facilities , cultural and religious infrastructures and institutions and engaged in ethnic cleansing , causing large numbers of persons to become displaced .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Strongly condemns extremist violence in certain municipalities in southern Serbia and welcomes the plan of the Federal and Republic Governments to resolve the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia peacefully , including political and economic reform designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society , and calls for a rapid implementation of the plan ;  
Welcoming the announced reduction of the United Army Group in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation and the number of checkpoints , and also welcoming the re-establishment of a judicial system with a supreme court , and regional and city courts in the Republic of Chechnya , the increased involvement of ethnic Chechens in the police forces as well as the mixed composition at checkpoints ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , discrimination against , inter alia , Africans , people of African descent , Arabs and Muslims , and incidents of xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Recognize that education and lifelong learning are basic for the respect of the racial , ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious diversity of our societies which is essential to prevent the spread of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and is of key importance for protecting and promoting democratic values ;  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Urge States to adopt or strengthen , as appropriate , national programmes for eradicating poverty among indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and also request that they expand their efforts to foster bilateral , regional and international cooperation in implementing those programmes ;  
Urge States to reaffirm their democratic commitment and take the necessary legislative , administrative and judicial measures , in accordance with their obligations under regional and international human rights instruments , to condemn and actively discourage all forms of propaganda , publicity , organizations , associations , political parties or groups inspired by ideas or theories of the superiority of one race or ethnic group and that seek to justify or promote racial hatred , xenophobia or racial discrimination ;  
Urge States to establish , on the basis of existing statistical information , national programmes , including affirmative action measures , to promote the access of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities to education , medical care and basic social services ;  
Invite States to promote and support the establishment and functioning of enterprises , owned by indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities favouring access to credits and training programmes ;  
Request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a fourth branch within her Office to foster activities to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to promote the rights of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
Encourage all relevant actors to intensify their efforts at the national , regional and international levels , especially by means of education , to ensure that children are educated from an early age in those values , attitudes and ways of conduct and life that will allow them to resolve conflicts of a racial or ethnic character peacefully , in a spirit of respect for human dignity , tolerance and non-discrimination ;  
Urge States to discourage advertising that portrays stereotypical or otherwise negative images of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants , and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and to encourage advertising that promotes a broader understanding of these victims of racism and fosters the values of diversity , tolerance and mutual respect ;  
Invite States to take appropriate constitutional , legislative and administrative measures , to foster equality among individuals , indigenous peoples , among people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities whose members are frequently victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and review existing measures with a view to amending or repealing national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
Urge the international community to take cognizance of the very real difficulties that peoples of different racial and ethnic backgrounds inevitably experience in seeking to live together and to develop genuine harmonious multiracial societies .  
In summary , we can say that the main provisions contained in the Constitution are the following : political pluralism , separation of and collaboration among the legislative , executive and judicial powers , the right of all citizens to protection and to develop and express their ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious identity .  
Convinced of the fundamental importance of universal accession or ratification to and full implementation of [ the / our ] obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instrument to eliminate racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance [ based on race , color , descent , or national or ethnic origin ] ,  
PP8bis Reaffirming our commitment to combating all manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance on grounds of [ race , lineage , colour , religion , culture , language or national or ethnic origin * ] [ aggravated by forms of multiple discrimination based on reasons of age , gender , [ sexual orientation ] , physical and mental ability disability , or socio-economic status * ] ,  
In addition , under article 7 ( h ) , [ p ] ersecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law is also considered a crime against humanity .  
The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child guarantees the rights therein to every child and states further that [ e ] very child shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized and guaranteed in this Charter irrespective of the childs or his / her parents or legal guardians race , ethnic group , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national and social origin , fortune , birth or other status ( art . 
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
[ 10 ] After considering information in States parties reports concerning the ways in which individuals are identified as being members of a particular racial or ethnic group , the Committee stated that such identification should , if no justification existed to the contrary , be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned . 
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
We also recognize that some persons are victims of multiple discrimination , including on the grounds of race , colour , descent , ethnic , linguistic or national origin , gender , sexual orientation , age , disability , religion , culture , social or economic status , property or birth ;  
We underline the essential contribution of independent specialized bodies at national , regional or local levels in promoting equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin or religious background ;  
Urges States to take the necessary measures to ensure that no person will be expelled , extradited or returned to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture or persecution on account of his or her [ race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ] racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic , or national origin [ or political affiliation ] ;  
Urges States to work with law enforcement agencies in designing , implementing and enforcing effective policies and programmes to prevent , detect and ensure accountability for incidents of police misconduct motivated by race or ethnic origin , to prosecute such police misconduct and to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement officials or the use of race or ethnicity as the sole basis for determining if an individual is engaged in criminal activity ;  
Urges States to establish national programmes to promote the access , without any discrimination , of people of African descent , Mestizos , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , linguistic and religious groups , minorities , and indigenous peoples , where they exist , to education , medical care and other social services and to eliminate by the year 2010 the disparities these groups experience , inter alia in infant mortality rate , childhood immunization , HIV / AIDS , heart disease , cancer and contagious diseases ;  
Urges Governments to counter social exclusion and marginalization of racial , ethnic , cultural , religious , linguistic and national minorities , in particular by providing de facto equal access to education , health services , employment and housing ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;

Furthermore it urges them to work in partnership at the national , regional and international levels to develop appropriate policy tools that facilitate the development of legislation , policies and programmes that take into account ethnic , racial , linguistic , religious and cultural diversity ;  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
Recruitment and use of child soldiers , the proliferation of small arms , the indiscriminate use of landmines , large-scale forced displacement and ethnic cleansing , the targeting of women and children , the denial of even the most basic human rights , and widespread impunity for atrocities are still all too familiar features of war .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .

On 31 July 2000 , the Government of Denmark reported that immigrants and refugees generally enjoyed legal equality with Danish citizens and , like all citizens , they were protected by law against discrimination on the basis of race , colour , religious belief , political observation , sexual orientation or national , social or ethnic origin .  
In particular , he identified three areas of ongoing concern : the human rights situation and physical protection of ethnic minority communities in Kosovo ; the quality of the rule of law , including the independence of the judiciary ; and the extent to which human rights standards are reflected and integrated into the policies and practices of UNMIK and KFOR . 
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established . 
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions . 
Today aggression , intervention , interference in the internal affairs of other States , occupation of other countries territories by force , irredentism , racism and the threat or actual use of force , which had been considered relics of the past , manifest themselves along with rampant terrorism and other new forms of violence , deportations , ethnic cleansing , genocide and massive violations of human rights .

It is reported that the two ethnic groups living in the Ituri region , Hema and Lendu , have been in rivalry for a long time , fighting for land resources and the like .  In recent months , there have been continuous mass armed clashes , causing tremendous casulty and losses .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
Addressing a national conference of nationalities affairs commissions on economic work which closed today , Li Dezhu , Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , noted : as far as ethnic affairs are concerned , we must be brave in blazing new trails , boldly explore new frontiers , improve the quality of our work , thus make contributions to the large-scale development of the western region .  
Nationalities affairs commissions at all levels must seize the opportunity , always focus on economic construction as the center , proceed from the state 's major political guideline and from the actual circumstances of ethnic areas in the western part of the country , research into the policy and measures for expediting the development of ethnic areas , study specific issues such as reform and opening up , social progress , and key tasks that aim to help impoverished areas , and properly handle the relationship between development and unity .  
The cultural pride and ethnic self-respect that have been formed within the Chinese nation over the five-thousand-year history of its ancient civilization is a sure guarantee that the Chinese people , having " stood up , " and carrying on in the glorious tradition of patriotism , will uphold the principles of national unification and territorial completion more than any other sacred mission .  
So long as our party always acts as the faithful representative of the demands of the development of the advanced social productive forces in the China , the direction of the development of the advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people in China , our party will forever be in an invincible position , and will forever have the heartfelt support of the people of all ethnic groups of the country and continuously lead them forward .  
It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
Deputy Abdulahat Abdurixit , chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People 's Government , stated : Large-scale development of western regions has offered ethnic minorities regions ' development with a historical opportunity unknown in the past , while a stable social environment is the prerequisite for large-scale development , for nothing could be accomplished without a stable social environment . 
Inner Mongolia deputies Liu Mingzu , Yun Bulong , Lei Eerdeni , Niu Yuru , Chen Pengshan , Ma Dehai , Wang Weishan , Zhu Guangkai and Cha Gan separately expressed their views on the autonomous region 's economic development , large-scale development of China 's Western Region , transformation of old industrial base , exploitation of rare earth elements , grassland construction , reform of state-owned enterprises , establishment of a social security system , economic restructuring , and attaching importance to education in ethnic minority regions .  
Speaking about the two main themes of " unity and democracy , " Li Ruihuan said being the most extensive patriotic united front organization , the CPPCC should hold high the banner of unity , and pull together people of different parties , different social strata , different ethnic groups and different religious beliefs through seeking common ground while reserving differences , understanding , magnanimity , coordinating relations , and resolving contradictions .  
The decision is of great significance to expand domestic demand and bring about sustained growth of national economy , to promote coordinated economic development in all regions and eventually achieve a common prosperity , and to strengthen ethnic unity , maintain social stability and fortify border defense .  
Observers here are convinced that the fundamental cause of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo is because the UN delegation and international peacekeeping force in Kosovo have not earnestly implemented Resolution 1244 adopted by the UNSC but are carrying out a policy of " supporting Albanians and suppressing Serbs . " They have shown partiality for and connived with Albanian extremists ' " ethnic cleansing " against other nationalities .  
The United States led NATO to conduct military intervention in the ethnic dispute inside the FRY and to openly support the " Kosovo Liberation Army , " a terrorist and splittist organization .  This created a bad precedent in supporting national splittism and terrorist activities in the domain of international relations .  The national splittist forces in some countries and international terrorists saw their chance and started provoking and making trouble .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
and we should learn from them in taking a firm stance and clearly distinguishing between right and wrong , cherish the excellent situation of stability and unity , and resolutely wage struggle against phenomena that jeopardize ethnic solidarity , national security , and social stability , as practical deeds for preserving social and political stability .  
Under the CPC leadership , the Chinese people , with their firm conviction and hard work , have been relying on their own efforts and waging arduous struggles ; and they have achieved brilliant successes in the great course of building socialism .  Now , guided by the grand objectives set by the 15th National Party Congress for cross-century development , people of all ethnic groups in the country are confidently heading toward the new century .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory shine in the annals of the public , which have recorded the glorious course traversed by the people of all ethnic groups in their arduous struggle led by the CPC , engraved the great achievements made in the process of creating and building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and crystallized the wisdom and strategies of the party 's three generations of leading collectives with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as their cores .  
They have shown their spirit of persistent struggle and demonstrated excellent sports techniques and displayed the lofty morality of sports .  They have shown the Chinese nation 's outlook of being inspired , struggling for progress , and being vigorous and enthusiastic .  They have contributed to the promotion and development of the Olympic spirit and greatly inspired all ethnic groups of people throughout the country and officers and soldiers throughout the military , who are marching into the new century with their chins up .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
Practice has proven that since the actual foundations on which individual countries establish socialism vary , their methods of gaining political power vary , and their ethnic and national conditions vary , there can be no single model of development that fits every country .  
Provided that our party remains the requirement of the development of advanced social productivity in China , the way forward for advanced culture in China and the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people , it will always be invincible , will always have the heartfelt support of all ethnic groups throughout the country and will be able to lead the masses in pressing ahead incessantly .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
The third generation leadership group with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the vision and leadership skill to handle various complex situations , face various risks and resolve various difficulties .  This leadership group , which has won sincere support and admiration of the whole Party , the entire military and all ethnic groups of the country , is the loyal , reliable , diligent and promising successor of the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
We must hold aloft the banner of ethnic solidarity and progress , vigorously propagate the party 's ethnic and religious policies , and do more practical and good things for the minority-nationality masses , to consolidate the excellent situation of people of all nationalities breathing the same air , sharing the same destiny , and being linked heart to heart .  
How can they allow their constantly improving livelihood be jeopardized by the Dalai . In the questionnaires , the residents in the Chengguan District of Lhasa City have given a resounding answer .  They , as well as the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , are deeply aware that the blind religious worship people have for the Dalai Lama , who has ulterior motives , has not only stifled their ideas but also shackled their hands and feet ;  
not only will it deprive them of an affluent life , but it may restore the history written in blood and tears .  The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have deep-seated hatred for the feudal serf system of the old Tibet , entertain an infinite love for the socialist new Tibet , and cherish intense hatred for the Dalai 's separatist and sabotage activities .  
The fact that under the staunch leadership of the party , the anti-separatist struggle in our region has turned from the state of passively meeting an emergency to one of taking the initiative to tackle problems in a comprehensive way and that our social and political situation remains stable shows that the 2.6-million people of all ethnic groups , the main body in the struggle against the separatist clique headed by the Dalai , are carrying out this struggle with strong determination , redoubled confidence , and high morale until they win a complete victory .  
At present , with the kind attention of the central authorities and the vigorous support of the people of the whole country , the people of all ethnic groups in our region are firmly seizing the rare opportunity provided by the stable political situation and the large-scale development of west China and , with unprecedented enthusiasm and drive , striking up a magnificent movement of leapfrogging development .  
Qian Qichen said : " During my visit , I also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the US Congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic Chinese community , and community of Chinese people residing in the United States . They all expressed the wish to see China and the United States friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
People of countries the world over , politicians , political parties , social groups , and media of many countries including the United States , and overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have made speeches and published articles supporting the Chinese Government 's just stance and the spirit of struggle in showing no fear of mighty power , attacked the unreasonable and unjustified US attitude , and exposed the US conspiracy to trample on the sovereignty of other countries and establish world hegemony .  
Due to the constraints of historical and geographical factors , the level of economic and social development in some areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is comparatively backward .  
Li Baodong pointed out : According to this strategy , the Chinese Government will appropriate huge amounts of funds for developing infrastructure facilities and basic industries in these areas , thus keeping the economic growth rate in these areas higher than the national average .  Last year , the economic growth rate in the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups reached 8.5 percent .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
At today 's pledging and mobilizing meeting held by the city public security organs in Urumqi City to launch the " hard striking " anti-crime struggle , Du Jianxi said that although ethnic separatists and violent terrorists were suppressed in most cases , they still pose a threat to social and political stability .  
Yunnan Province has rich tourism resources as it has beautiful natural scenes and pleasant weather .  There are many scenic spots and a rich variety of cultural features and customs of minority ethnic groups .  All this is huge economic potential to be tapped .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Hence , in the drive to " strike hard " and put things in order , it is necessary to make full preparations to consistently regard as the most important thing the crackdown on organized crime , especially organized crime of all kinds committed by backbone ethnic separatist elements , elements who commit bombing and terrorism , and extremist religious elements ; we must take the initiative to attack them , and hit them as soon as they show themselves .  
Attention should also be paid to recruiting female party members from urban resident communities , social organizations , non-public economic organizations , and areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  The structure of the party rank and file should be continuously improved .  Party organizations should be extended more widely to various social circles .  
He paid close attention to launching a struggle against ethnic separatism , being aware of the collusion between a handful of ethnic separatist elements at home and abroad and international anti-China forces to carry out separatist and disruptive activities against our country .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Comrade Wang Wei was an outstanding representative of contemporary Chinese youths .  He epitomized the characteristics of the young generation of our time - - ambitious , eager to learn , bold in practice , always thinking about the interests of the motherland , and keen to serve the people .  He is the example whom the youths of all ethnic groups throughout the country in the new period should learn from .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
They said : Following the plane collision incident , the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country worried about Wang Wei and shared a bitter hatred of the hegemonic act , thereby fully demonstrating the strong cohesive force of the Chinese nation .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
When inspecting the earthquake-stricken areas in Garze Zhang Autonomous Prefecture , Sichuan Province a few days ago , State Concillor Ismail Amat stressed : Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and with support of the people throughout China , the people of disaster areas heightened fighting spirit , worked cease lily and unremittingly , further strengthened ethnic unity , carried out reconstruction in disaster areas in a down-to-earth and effective manner , and won a comprehensive victory in earthquake relief work .  
Efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the central authorities pursuing the large-scale western development strategy , put reconstruction work onto the local governments ' 10th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development and their programs for poverty eradication through development , promote development through the reconstruction efforts , and unceasingly facilitate common prosperity among all ethnic groups .  
We must further enhance our political awareness , the sense of responsibility and overall interests , carry out resolute struggle against all activities that endanger the country 's reunification , all ethnic groups ' unity , state security , and social and political stability , against " Falungong " and other evil cults , and against all sorts of negative and corruptive phenomena , and effectively maintain the stable and united social and political situation .  
This law also explicitly states that " the national defense education should adhere to the strategy that all ethnic groups should participate in this education in a permanent , persistent and effective manner and should conform to the principle of uniting regular education with centralized education , associating polarization education with education for special purposes and combining theory education with behavioral education . "  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
Therefore , correctly understanding and mastering the relationship between common characters and individual characters , fully understanding the protracted nature , complexity , and importance of the ethnic and religious issues , upholding the ideological line of seeking truth from facts , and proceeding from the actual conditions in Tibet in doing everything are important principles which must be mastered in doing work well .  
On the afternoon of 22 May , patriotic personages of all ethnic groups from all social circles across the region held a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Looking back at the tremendous changes that had taken place in Tibet under the leadership of the CPC over the past half a century , they warmly lauded the glorious practice and the great victory of the party 's policies towards nationalities , religion , and the united front in Tibet .  
Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and thanks to the vigorous support and selfless assistance of all brother provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have forged ahead in unity in a pioneering spirit , speeded up the region 's development , defended the unification of the motherland and fought against national splittism , and have attained world-acclaimed achievements in the region 's socialist revolutionary and construction undertakings .  
During an interview by the press , Tang Yinlong said the Dalai is not just a religious figure , but also the general representative of the serf system in Tibet and a political refugee in the garb of religion who , over a long time , has engaged himself abroad in criminal activities of trying to split up the country and undermining unity among ethnic groups .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
The result is that the gap between the poor and the rich has widened , relations between ethnic groups have become tense , and class confrontations have intensified .  No doubt that the middle - and lower-class have been displeased , many people of the upper class , including such moderate of the Republican Party as Jeffords , also have been complaining quite a lot .  
During a recent inspection tour of Sichuan , Zhu Rongji , member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and premier of the State Council , pointed out that the implementation of the project to protect natural forests and the experiments on returning farmland land to forests at selected points have progressed smoothly and remarkable results have been obtained .  In particular , this has further speeded up the economic development of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
He emphasized that in the final analysis , the realization of comprehensive prosperity and development of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is determined by whether or not the broad masses of people and cadres of areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups can increase their confidence , rely on themselves , and work hard and perseveringly to make common progress .  
In particular , it should attach great importance to , and earnestly speed up , the development of tourism .  Sichuan has rich and colorful tourist resources .  It particular , it has cultural sites of historic interest , world-famous natural heritage , unique and fantastic natural scenery , and unique local ethnic customs and practices .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
The university has also trained a large number of professional and technical cadres , specialists , scholars , and professors , who have made remarkable contributions in their own posts to the cause of building socialism and the maintaining of the unification of the motherland and the unity of various nationalities and played an extremely important role in the economic and social development of areas inhabited by ethnic groups .  
He spoke highly of the important role of the corps in production , construction , consolidating frontier defense , maintaining stability , and promoting ethnic solidarity , and encouraged its members to keep firmly in mind the heavy tasks entrusted them by the party and the people , further increase their sense of the historical mission and political responsibility of defending the border area and doing farm work there , and give full play to their role of a mainstay in promoting Xinjiang 's economic and social development and maintaining Xinjiang 's stability .  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
At the fifth " Shanghai Five " summit held in July 2000 in Dushanbe , leaders of the member states reiterated their determination to " jointly combat such international criminal activities that contribute the most threats to the region 's security , stability and development such as ethnic separatism , religious extremism , international terrorism , illegal arms smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal migration . "  It also proposed to sign treaties and pacts on multilateral cooperation among the member states .  
This unprecedented photo exhibition - - in chronological order and by means of detailed and genuine materials and vivid pictures of the past - - genuinely repeats the splendid 80-year history of the Communist Party of China , affectingly recalling the lofty spirit that inspired countless revolutionary martyrs to die .  The exhibition enthusiastically sings praise to the great achievements of the revolution , the construction and reform made by all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party .  
The united front should firmly adoptthe guiding principle of serving economic construction , should pool the wisdom and strength of all social strata , all political parties , all ethnic groups , all social organizations , and the people in all social circles for advancing our country 's socialist modernization .  
It should strive to safeguard social and political stability , firmly oppose national separatist and religious extremist forces , actively coordinate relations between different strata , different social groups , different parties , different ethnic groups , and different religions inside the united front , take timely actions to remove various negative factors that may affect our social and political stability , and create a concerted , stable , and harmonious social environment for reform , opening-up , and modernization .  
He said , overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have transnational culture , and there are also many specialized talented people among them ; there are more than 100,000 highly talented Chinese in science and technology and various specialities in North America ; this is advantageous for the United States in opening up the China market , for China 's economic construction , and for ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese to develop their business .  
After giving a briefing on the main problems that affect social stability for the time being , Luo Gan listed the efforts to be made in the next step : First , strictly guard against and severely crack down on the criminal activities of the ethnic separatist forces , the religious extremist forces , and the violent terrorist forces , deal harsh blows at the sabotage activities of the hostile forces , and resolutely safeguard national security and unity .  
An official of the Ministry of Public Security has revealed that the current main factors for instability in China are : " the activities of hostile forces abroad , of ethnic separatist organizations , and of ' Falungong ' " ; criminal terrorist activities involving ethnic separatist organizations and related religious extremist forces have the greatest impact on social tranquillity , while there have recently been " new trends " in the activities of " Falungong . "  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
Looking into China 's future in the 21st century , the economy is prosperous , all ethnic groups are united , society is stable , governmental administration is smooth , and people are friendly and happy in this flourishing and prosperous situation .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
They included college students of the 56 ethnic groups , young pioneers wearing red ties , and outstanding athletes who won remarkable results in domestic and international sports events .  
He first expressed warm welcome to the triumphant return of the delegation on behalf of the party central leadership , the State Council , and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , expressed warm congratulations and cordial greetings to the members of the bidding delegation and all people participating in the bidding work , and expressed heartfelt gratitude to all friends who support Beijing 's bid .  
You have been staunchly struggling against Western hostile forces and nationalistic separatist elements and winning major victories in quelling rebellious forces , suppressing bandits , and fighting back against the enemies in defending ourselves , thus effectively maintaining Tibet 's social stability and stability in Tibet 's border areas , and defending national sovereignty , territorial integrity , and ethnic unity .  You have been endeavoring to fulfill the fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people ;  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin said that " as long as our Party always represents the requirements of the development of China 's advanced productive forces , the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China , our Party will be in an invincible position , will always receive the great support of the people of every ethnic group across the country and will lead the people in continuously pressing ahead . "  
" Unprecedentedly , Taiwan is in contact and linked with the motherland . "  This has enabled the people on the island to understand the motherland in greater depth and changed their impression about the mainland , thereby enhancing to a great extent their sense of ethnic identification and unity with the motherland .  A profound social and psychological foundation has thus been established for " one country , two systems " to go deep into the hearts of the Taiwan people .  
This great historical process is a necessity in the social and historical development of Tibet , is a common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , and is also a brilliant example as how the CPC has applied the basic principles of Marxism for the resolution of China 's national issues .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
Today 's Tibet is a picture of vigor and prosperity as the economy is developing , society is making progress , the various ethnic groups are united , the situation is stable , the border defense is solid and the people are leading a peaceful and contented life .  
Because of the rapid development in education , science and technology , culture , public health and other social services , people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have achieved substantial progress in ideological and moral awareness and in their knowledge about science and other academic subjects .  
In the long historical development , the hardworking and intelligent people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have made remarkable contributions to creating the shinning cultures of the Chinese nation and to building our unified multinational country .  The brilliant chapter of Tibet 's development and progress in the past 50 years that you have written has added new glory to the big family of our socialist motherland .  
The celebrations have fully reflected the tremendous progress achieved by Tibet over the past 50 years , given wide publicity to the principles and policies of the central authorities toward Tibet , considerably aroused the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups in building up a new socialist Tibet , and will surely bring about a vigorous development to all undertakings in Tibet in the new century .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
In order to ensure that the " Lee Teng-hui line " which he operated for many years can be effectively extended and continually " developed and enhanced " among the new authorities , Lee Teng-hui , who moved about freely in the Taiwan political arena for 12 years , has ignored the strong demands of the people for rejuvenating the economy and improving cross-strait relations and has not hesitated to stir up conflict between ethnic groups and strike at those forces advocating the motherland 's reunification .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
At this jubilant moment , we would like to extend festival congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the army and the armed police force , the militiamen and the reserves , cordial regards to retired old cadres , demobilized servicemen , disabled soldiers and family members of martyrs , who have made outstanding contribution to the building of the people 's army , and high respect to people of all ethnic groups across the country who are concerned about and support national defense and army building ! 
Tibet learned firsthand that the Chinese Communist Party is the faithful representative of the interests of all the peoples of Tibet . The socialist road is the road which Tibet must take for economic development , national progress , long-lasting social order , and the well-being of the people .  Resolutely protecting the unity of the motherland , opposing ethnic division , and strengthening ethnic unity is a basic premise by which the cause of revolution and construction in Tibet will be a success .  
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .

Zhu Rongji said , the CPC Central Committee and State Council are very concerned for Guizhou 's economic and social development ; we hope that the provincial party committee and government will seriously implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " and lead the people of all nationalities in the province to work with concerted efforts , engage in pioneering and innovation , and speed up the building of a beautiful new Guizhou with prosperous economy , social progress , and people of all ethnic groups living in harmony .  
We should play a vanguard role in the building of a spiritual civilization , guide the masses of all ethnic groups to emancipate their minds and renew their concepts , advocate science , and provide a strong spiritual motive power for economic growth in border areas .  We should play the role of a commando in the country 's large-scale development of its western region , firmly establish the thinking that we must develop and bring wealth to border areas while defending and consolidating them ;  
Through this window , people can feel that China , a country with a stable political environment , with an increasingly developed economy , with ethnic unity , with social progress and with increasingly greater overall national strength , stands in the East and is a major credit to maintaining global peace and development .  
Under the support of the Central Government , Tibet has attained economic development and social progress .  Tibet has been improving its people 's living standards ; remarkably advanced its ethnic culture , education , and public health ;  
The unitary state political system has played a tremendous role in promoting ethnic unity among the 56 ethnic groups , national unity , the coordinated development of various regions , and common prosperity .

Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Any person , so long as he lives in this world , should enjoy the rights to subsistence , personal security , and all kinds of freedom .  People should treat each other equally despite their races , white , yellow , or black , and religious beliefs .  Any discrimination , hostility , killing in revenge , or ethnic cleansing is considered illegal .  
By integrating basic Marxist theory on ethnic and religious issues with the specific reality of China , our party has formed a complete set of correct ethnic and religious policies , and we must uphold these for a long time .  
The two sides held that an earlier solution to the Afghanistan issue was in the interest of regional security and stability and stressed the need to seek a political settlement through negotiation between the parties concerned and establish a broad - based government representing all factions and ethnic groups . 
The party and the government attach great importance to economic development and social progress in areas inhabited by ethnic minority , and attach great importance to training and fostering a contingent of ethnic minority cadres with both moral integrity and ability , taking this as a major measure for safeguarding the unity of the motherland , realizing national regeneration and the common prosperity of all ethnical groups .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
The fourth five-nation summit was held in Bishkek , the capital of Krygyzstan , in August 1999 .  The joint statement issued after the summit further promised to make joint efforts to establish a mechanism of mutual cooperation , develop multilateral cooperation , promote regional stability , fight ethnic secessionism , and eliminate drug-trafficking and terrorism .  The five nations also reiterated that they would abide by their border treaties and agreement on military trust and make constructive contributions toward regional and world peace .  
Second , continuous efforts should be made to crack down on religious extremist forces , ethnic secessionist forces , international terrorism and other transnational crimes that endanger regional stability and security .  
The effective protection and rational utilization of scenic and historical resources are of great importance to the improvement of the ecological environment , the development of tourism , the promotion of ethnic culture , the stimulation of patriotic passion , and the enrichment of people 's cultural life .  
At a group discussion this afternoon ( 5 July ) on a draft law on the national common language , members of the Ninth National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee held that standardizing national common language usage in legal form and realizing the standardization of the national common language will play a positive role in promoting exchanges between ethnic groups , popularizing cultural education , developing science and technology , and meeting the needs of economic and social development .  
While inspecting the Urumqi-Kuitun Freeway , Ismail Amat pointed out : By standing high , seeing far , and facing up to a new century , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has made such a wise decision as to implement a strategy of developing the western regions on a large scale , this being also a strategic arrangement made by the central authorities for speeding up the development of the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities .  
In particular , in 1999 , centering on major events such as the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state , the 40th anniversary of the democratic revolution in Tibet , the Lhasa area contests of the sixth national ethnic minority games , and the reversion of Macao , the whole region carried out two major checks on the use of script in society , with the focus on Lhasa , and achieved regular , artistic , and clean use of script in society , thus displaying a good image of Tibet .  
and it is also the requirement of speeding up the improvement of ethnic quality and promoting the joint progress of all minorities .  At present the cultural level of the masses in Tibet is not high , a large proportion of adults in the rural and pastoral areas are illiterate , and it is necessary to rely on and use the Tibetan language to popularize scientific and cultural knowledge , improve labor skills , and enrich the people 's cultural life .  
The " Opinions " points out : All localities should strive to explore a way of developing vocational schools that conform to the characteristics of minority nationalities and ethnic minority regions , in consideration of local conditions and the current level of economic and educational development of the minority nationalities and the ethnic minority regions .  
The " Opinions " demands that while maintaining an equal level of fund appropriation between vocational schools and regular schools , all localities should gradually increase the appropriation to the former year by year ; that a proper proportion of the subsidies for urban and rural vocational education appropriated by the central government to various provinces and autonomous regions should be used exclusively in the vocational education for minority nationalities and in ethnic minority regions ;  
The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .  The improvement in such environment itself is a kind of important fundamental construction , which is just as important as the construction of infrastructure and other hardware .  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .  
We sincerely hope that all relevant factions in Burundi will value the peace and stability of the country and the fundamental interests of the people above everything else , completely abandon the tribal and ethnic feud based on the spirit of national reconciliation , and resolve the existing differences by continuing to engage in dialogue and negotiations , so as to finally bring about lasting peace and political stability and economic development of the country .  
its industrial structure under went gradual readjustments ; social undertakings in areas such as science and technology , education , culture , and health made considerable progress ; the people 's living standards improved unceasingly ; and the relations of equality , unity , and mutual help between different ethnic groups have been further consolidated .  All this constitutes a solid foundation for Tibet 's better development in the new century .  Practice has proven that the party 's ethnic policy and the central authorities ' numerous principles guiding Tibet 's work are entirely correct .  
Jiang Zemin 's speech at the lunch was his only public speech to nongovernmental bodies during his trip to attend the UN Millennium Summit . The contents dealt with various aspects of Sino-US relations , including the most crucial problem , that of Taiwan ; he also dwelt at length on China 's social system , cultural background , national spirit , and social state , and elaborated on the Chinese Government 's policies on press freedom , religious freedom , strengthening the rule of law , and ethnic policy .  
Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
He first expressed his warm welcome to the friends who have come from afar , and extended his sincere greetings and festival wishes to various democratic parties , public figures without party affiliation , personalities from various mass groups , ethnic groups , and social circles across the country , compatriots from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan , and overseas Chinese .  
The Chinese Communist Party has united and led the various ethnic groups of China and carried out an indomitable and extremely hard and bitter struggle , always passing on the torch .  They overturned the " three mountains " that oppressed the Chinese people and created a new historical era in which the Chinese are their own masters in independently constructing socialism .  
Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this time , the Chinese Olympic delegation has made historical breakthroughs , displayed fully to the whole world the spiritual style and features of being united and forging ahead of the Chinese people , greatly encouraged the patriotic fervor of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , increased the national cohesive force of Chinese at home and abroad , and further enhanced the high prestige of the socialist motherland .  
Through painstaking efforts made by several generations , in the middle of the 21st century , while the whole nation has basically realized modernization , the western region will be also usher in a new look of economic prosperity , social progress , unity among all ethnic groups , stability in people 's livelihood , beautiful natural environment , and richness enjoyed by the people . "  
During his inspection tour of Guangdong , he particularly emphasized again that as long as our party always faithfully represents the development needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the direction of China 's advanced cultural progress , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the Chinese people , our party will always be invincible , always win the sincere support of the people of various ethnic groups across the country , and always lead the people in their advances .  
However , their moves met with strong opposition from the local overseas Chinese students , ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese nationals , who wrote to the press , denouncing their perverse and evil preaching and exposing their tricks in hoodwinking the public as well as the despicable deeds of the " Falungong " members who robbed people in the streets because they were possessed by the devil , thus laying bear the true features of the " Falungong " as a cult .  
Jiang Zemin said : Since the formation of the new Cambodian government , the two major ruling parties have , proceeding from the fundamental national and ethnic interests , cooperated unifiedly and worked hard to consolidate national reconciliation , developed the economy , actively developed foreign relations , and made tremendous achievements in domestic and foreign affairs work .  
During the meeting , Ye Xuanping gave a briefing on the achievements in reform and opening up of the motherland 's mainland as well as on the new social look of areas inhabited by the people of the Haka ethnic group .  He sincerely hoped compatriots on both sides of the strait will make great efforts to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese nation , take the culture of the Chinese nation as a link , promote consensus , communication and understanding , and make concerted efforts to promote the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
Conflicts between advocates for reunification and independence are sharpening , the demand to develop cross-Strait relations has become the dominant popular opinion in Taiwan , and forces opposing independence and promoting reunification are growing .  Calls opposing independence and promoting reunification have also reached an unprecedented height among overseas and ethnic Chinese abroad .  
Hu Yuanshao , the eighth chairman of the European Federation of Overseas Chinese and Ethnic Chinese Mass Organizations and president of the Austrian General Association of Ethnic Chinese , said : An early accomplishment of peaceful reunification by China is the common wish of overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese . The pursuit of " Taiwan independence " is not tolerable to the international community , much less to the sentiment of fellow countrymen living abroad .  
Pan Zhongqian , responsible person of the preparatory committee for Italy 's Association for Promoting China 's Peaceful Reunification , said : The tens of millions of overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese are a tremendous , irresistible driving force for China 's peaceful reunification .  
Shi Sihao , vice president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots , and Tang Shubei , director of the China Research Center for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait , successively visited France in the second half of the year and were both received with the utmost cordiality by fellow countrymen living in France . Practically all the overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese mass organizations in France participated in activities for exchanges and communication with them , giving advice and suggestions for accomplishing China 's great cause of peaceful reunification .  
is a central link that unites the whole party and people of all ethnic groups of the entire country in their fulfillment of all the tasks set by the party and the state ; and is also a major political advantage enjoyed by our party and our socialist country .  Only when we give full play to the ideological-political work , which is our political advantage , can we ensure that our economic work as well as work in other fields can develop towards a correct direction ;  
While inspecting the return cabin of " Shenzhou I , " President Jiang Zemin encouraged some of the engineering , research and experiment personnel : Make persistent efforts to promote the development of China 's advanced science and high technology , and make greater contributions to increasing China 's comprehensive national strength , strength in science and technology , strength in national defense , and ethnic cohesive strength .  
Also attending the meeting were leaders of the central committees of all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , leading cadres and personages without party affiliation , personages of ethnic and religious circles living in Beijing , and responsible persons of the units under the united front system .  A total of 300 people attended the party .  
Regional conflicts sparked by ethnic , religious , territorial , resource , and other factors have continued to break out ; all kinds of splittist forces , terrorist forces , and extremist forces have continued to compromise the international community ; environmental , drug , refugee , and other global problems have become increasingly prominent .  
Finally , he pointed out : In the new century , the vast areas inhabited by minority ethnical groups will be facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges , the strategy for the great development of the west will promote economic development in these areas .  The entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country should be full of confidence , continuously advance the cause of ethnic unity and progress in our country , and work hard for the comprehensive regeneration of the Chinese nation .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and thanks to the concerted efforts made by the people of all ethnic groups all over the country , last year , China made noticeable achievements in national economic and social development and greatly improved its national economy .  The situation with the implementation of various plans was good , in general .  Faster economic growth was maintained .  
Answering a question on the activities of some " Tibet independence " advocates now living abroad , Lhaba Pingcuo said : Owing to the Dalai Lama and the handful of people who attempt to split the motherland and some Western media 's untrue and distorted reports , some ethnic Tibetan countrymen living overseas still do not know the real situation in Tibet .  
At his work posts , he made great contributions to the party 's ethnic work , united front work , and socialist cause .  In 1978 , he was elected as vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee . Though being at an advanced age , he still paid close attention to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the development of the areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , and still cared about the development and use of water resources in the motherland .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Our commemoration of this outstanding CPC member and leading cadre of a minority ethnic group is of great immediate significance for carrying forward his noble spirit of loving the motherland and loving the people and for safeguarding the motherland 's unification , strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups , maintaining social stability , and promoting the progress and development of all undertakings in areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Liang Dianchen , commissioner of the Xigaze Administrative Office , said : Xigaze is the most populous and largest prefecture in Tibet . It is located on the front of fighting secession .  Because of the implementation of all party policies , the situation in Xigaze is a gratifying one marked by economic growth , social stability , and solidarity among people of all ethnic groups .  
After the deputies finished talking , Hu Jintao said : As result of the strong leadership of the party Central Committee and the energetic support of people across the country , as well as the guidance of the Tibet autonomous region party committee and government , people of all ethnic groups have worked hard and basically achieved the goals which the Central Committee 's third forum set for projects to be accomplished in Tibet in the year 2000 .  
The 65 million people of different ethnic groups in the province are united as one as they exerted themselves and kept forging ahead .  In particular , they have gone through the rigorous tests of three consecutive years of exceptionally serious floods and scored remarkable achievements in economic and social development .  
The revised law on autonomy in areas inhabited by different ethnic groups will inevitably play a positive role in speeding up economic and social development and improving ethnic groups ' autonomy in those areas and further promoting the unity of all ethnic groups and improving the autonomous system in the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  
The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continued to advance along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , successfully fulfilled the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development , achieved the second-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and laid a good foundation for advancing toward the third-step strategic objective .  
In accordance with the domestic and international situation our nation is facing , the outline of the Tenth Five-Year Plan sets forth the main objectives , guiding principles , and major tasks for economic and social development in our country , points out the orientation for our further advances , and gives expression to the fundamental interests and common wishes of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
Zhu Bangzao pointed out that we have noticed that some media spread news about the incident in an irresponsible manner before it was thoroughly investigated , and some foreign media also spread untrue information about the incident .  They embellished the incident , distorted facts , and attacked China . Such acts have violated the professional ethnic of correspondents and are preposterous and wrong .  
Deputy Raidi from the Tibet delegation noted : The reason why Tibet has attained such a rapid economic growth and social progress is that the people of all ethnic groups in the region are living together in unity and harmony , and this has given rise to a stable social environment .  Tibet 's development over the past many years serves to show clearly that unity and stability are a prerequisite for development .  
Only by conscientiously implementing the party 's policy towards minority nationalities and put into effect the regional national autonomy can the equal rights of different minority nationalities , as well as the right of autonomy in national autonomous areas , be fully protected ; can the enthusiasm of the people of different ethnic groups be fully aroused ; and can a common prosperity be brought true among different nationalities .  
Raidi said , in the 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , the people 's awareness of preserving the unity of the motherland and opposing ethnic separatism has been further enhanced , and major victories have been won in the struggle against separatism ; at present " the situation is stable , social progress is being made , and there is ethnic solidarity . "  
Once the railway is built and operational , it will : further the economic and social development of Tibet and raise the people 's standard of living ; put Tibet in better economic and cultural contact with its brother provinces , autonomous regions and directly-administered municipalities ; bring the various ethnic groups closer together ;  
In the course of making great development in western areas and implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan , it is necessary to further consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups , promote comprehensive social and economic development , and strive to enhance the living standards of the masses .  In the course of economic development , attention should be paid to bring local advantages into better play .  
During the discussion , Deputy Gyaincain Norbu and Deputy Li Guohua said : Over the past year , the " two supremes " have played a vital role in cracking down in accordance with the law on " Falungong , " which is an evil cult , in training personnel involved in the political and legal work in western regions , in striking at ethnic separatists , and other aspects , and have stepped up self-building as well .  
The financial departments at all levels must guarantee funds for the " two supremes " in normal operation and must earnestly help departments involved in political and legal work in remote border areas , poor areas , or areas inhabited by ethnic minorities tackle the problem of lack of funds .  
The session holds that the summary of the work for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period contained in the Outline and Report is based on facts , while the targets , guiding principles , and main tasks set forth for the next five years ' work of economic and social development conform to the basic interests of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  They reflect the development of the times and the requirements of our modernization cause and can be realized through our efforts .  
In addition , it is imperative to keep to and make perfect the regional autonomous system for ethnic minorities so as to develop the socialist relations among different ethnic groups marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance and enable them to achieve common prosperity and progress .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
( c ) Under the existing policy , all eligible local children , including non-Chinese speaking children of ethnic minorities , are entitled to nine-year free and universal education .  
Apart from the fabulous showcase at the main stage , a " Dance Stage " will be set up at Sha Tin Town Hall Podium presenting splendid dance performances .  Renowned Alexandria Folk Dance Troupe of Egypt will lead the audiences to a dance journey to ancient Egypt , while local dance troupes will bring us Chinese ethnic dances and funky jazz dance .  
Local DSC playing Chinese music in western rock style , has given them the most indigenous face of all rock bands in Hong Kong . They also interpret traditional ethnic music with varying musical elements , which has earned them numerous awards on the way .  
" The synergy of Hong Kong and the Mainland , based on a unique ethnic relationship and an increasing economic interaction and integration , makes the city well poised as a strategic partner for international enterprises to establish a foothold in that vast market , " Mr Leung said . 
Tonight 's Carnival has attracted crowds of public to enjoy its entertaining programmes .  The Heilongjiang Province Song and Dance Theatre presented exciting ethnic music and dance performance .  Situated in the northeast of China , Heilongjiang is one of the only three black earth areas around the world .  Its song and dance art is crude and rustic , masculine yet passionate .  
This performance of Mongolian song and dance is an inside look at the customs , habits and cultural identity of the Mongolian people .  It comprises of rich living habits , colourful ethnic culture , unique individualistic aesthetic quality and the use of creative and innovative presentation style .  It embraces both the traditional and contemporary aspects of Mongolian artistic culture .  
And it will not condone any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin , which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life , " Ms Chan explained .  
Yanbian Song and Dance Troupe was established in 1946 , and since then has won national and international acclaim for their unique performing style of strong ethnic character and high artistic value .  
Among reports in the publication plan are a series of thematic reports on population sub-groups .  Thematic reports published earlier include older persons , youths , and women and men .  The report " Hong Kong 2001 Population Census Thematic Report - Ethnic Minorities " provides a comprehensive range of statistics on ethnic minorities in Hong Kong . It goes into some length in analysing the characteristics of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong : demographic characteristics , education , labour force , living arrangement and household characteristics , and geographical characteristics .  
Yanbian Song and Dance Troupe was established in 1946 , and since then has won national and international acclaim for their unique performing style of strong ethnic character and high artistic value . 
A spokesman for HAB said today ( January 18 ) , " The Government is committed to the promotion of racial harmony and mutual understanding between people of different ethnic or national origin , and the Project is launched with an aim to help foster awareness of racial harmony and equal opportunities among multi-ethnic groups through active participation and among the general public through the medium of highly visible images . "  
" Wonderful World of Tie-dye Girls " is a dance drama rich in ethnic colour , unique in conceptualisation and innovative in execution .  By using the famous tie-dye craft of western Hunan as the framework , and incorporating the five steps of the tie-dye process - spinning , weaving , tying , dyeing and rinsing - as well as the life of the female workers into the fabric of the story , these hardworking , kind-hearted and intelligent women are portrayed as the creators of in life and beauty .  
I particularly enjoy its bilingual format as it helps me to better my knowledge of the written Chinese language . One of my favorite sections is " Overseas Reports . " I am a second-generation ethnic Chinese , born and bred in New Zealand . I have a keen interest in Chinese living in other parts of the world , and Sinorama gives a fascinating account of fellow Chinese in some very surprising countries .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
The end of Autumn Chrysanthemum is a happy scene of great coming together amidst the conflict between different ethnic groups . The children from the military dependents villages used the fraternal method of financial gifts and peace mediation ( in Wu Chin-fa 's eyes , the children from the military dependents villages had the most resources in those years ) , to smooth over the conflicts between Fukienese-Taiwanese and Hakka-Taiwanese factions , and resolve a scene of bloody conflict .  
Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
However , the secularized tiger in China with its enormous area and complex ethnic mix naturally gave rise to a multiplicity of different symbolisms , creating apparent contradictions . This is no different from the imaginary dragon , for although the dragon is said to be holy and inviolable for the Chinese , there are also some stories of evil dragons .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
China 's Minority Peoples For photographers anxious to free themselves from commonplace and boring subjects , China 's ethnic minorities , with their unique customs , rustic appearances , colorful , varied clothing , and rugged , lofty mountains as a backdrop , hold a glamor that is difficult to express .  
In fact , outside the charmed circle of leading business families are large numbers of ethnic Chinese whose forebears came as laborers , and who still live at a low economic level with limited educational opportunities , just like the rest of the population . For many young women from this background , marriage is a means of escape from a life of poverty .  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Even if most of the descendants of the Ketagalan have forgotten their own identity , according to an investigation by Lin En-shean , a professor at National Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Ethnology , in the wake of the recent increasing social emphasis on " native soil , " meaning a new esteem for local Taiwanese culture , the atmosphere in society toward minority ethnic groups has evolved from prejudice and taboo to respect .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
In the southern Bay Area , where land is dear , the facilities at the Overseas Chinese Education Center are cramped , and most of the elderly groups try their luck elsewhere . On normal days the groups meet at municipal senior centers , apartment complexes for the elderly that house many seniors from Taiwan , or other places where they share space and resources with people of other ethnic groups .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' ! "  
During the most recent elections , President Lee Teng-hui , in his role as head of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) , put forward the " New Taiwanese " concept . The idea won the broad support of all four of the island 's major ethnic groups and helped the KMT to victory in the elections . Now the question is how these " New Taiwanese " will work together to build a peaceful and prosperous future for the Republic of China .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
Firstly , there is strong support among Taiwan 's population of 22 million people , regardless of ethnic group or provincial ancestry , for the concept of " new Taiwanese . " We share a common life and our interests fully coincide , and as we confront the latest round of threats from communist China it is vital that we rally together to protect our own national security .  
Taiwan is working hard to attain diplomatic and economic breakthroughs and hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the West . Beset with ethnic and environmental problems , popular culture reigns supreme .  
Fortunately , in the years since the lifting of martial law , once-downtrodden ethnic groups have begun to gain political clout and a sense of self-determination . The view that aboriginal culture must be preserved has become " politically correct " and mainstream . But social benefits to the aborigines can not depend on some fuzzy sense of charity . The aborigines need more thoughtful and efficacious aid .  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline . His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley . Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape . This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "  
The PRC is reported to be the main cause of the diplomatic rupture . Macedonia has been beset in recent years by both internal and external threats . Fighting connected with the separatist movement in neighboring Kosovo has generated a mass exodus of refugees into Macedonia , while the Macedonian government has been unable to quell a domestic rebellion by ethnic Albanians .  
Chiueh Tzi-hong is confident that future astronomy programs will naturally come to generate more " added value . " He quotes the example of the participation of the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Physics in the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) program led by ethnic Chinese Nobel laureate Professor Samuel Ting . The AMS instrument , which is designed to detect antimatter cosmic rays in space , will fly on the International Space Station , and Taiwan is responsible for manufacturing some of the electronic circuitry .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
In addition , Taiwan 's background as a former Japanese colony and the many Taiwanese who have studied and worked in the US give the island a human network of international dimensions . Add in the fact that the island shares a common language and culture with China and with ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia , and the tight ties between its own business , political and academic circles , and Taiwan looks to be very well positioned here at the beginning of the era of globalization .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
In September of last year , Dr . Lin , who had for a long time focused her research on blood groups and ethnic groups , published the results of a study entitled " Correlation between SARS virus infection and the human leukocyte antigen . " Lin concluded that there is a direct connection between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B46 and the severity of a SARS infection . She found that ethnic southern Chinese who  
Because the number of samples used in Lin 's study was small , because the results of her estimates could not be verified , and because there were ethical misgivings concerning ethnic bias , the Department of Health turned down her offer to use 10,000 doses of a screening reagent manufactured by Mackay Memorial Hospital to test doctors and nurses who were treating SARS patients . Lin was frustrated and bewildered by this decision , because all she had wanted to do was to help reduce the dangers to which medical personnel were exposed .  
Non governmental exchanges will help establish direct links between cultural groups of the two sides who have common interests However , he added , ethnic characteristics in various cultures must be preserved during the process of developing friendly relationship  
A stable political situation with no acute ethnic conflicts has also made Romania increasingly accepted as a safe investment by the international community , which has , in turn , heightened foreign investor confidence  
He further stated that cultural organizations specific to an ethnic group were permissible , but political parties based on ethnicity were not legal since membership would necessarily be discriminatory .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The result was a radical change in international relations , a profound shift in the balance of power and the emergence of underlying ethnic and national extremist trends which were suppressed under the former rule .  
As has been observed , ethnic tensions have become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies all over the globe - the advanced , the developing , the relatively stable and the unstable alike .  
To the infinite regret and dismay of the whole international community , we have continued to witness the outbreak of a great number of ethnic and national conflicts , accompanied by the untold suffering of innocent people .  
We regard as inadmissible any violent changes of frontiers as well as " ethnic cleansing " accompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human rights .  
Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be reconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into big and small , developed and underdeveloped , majority and minority groups , or along ethnic , racial and religious lines .  
The collapse of empires has let loose the savage impulse to settle historical scores , redress ancient ethnic grievances , and set right real or imagined injustices over national borders , the treatment of minorities , or the control of resources .  
Indeed , the promise of global peace and security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by political and ethnic conflicts , economic and social disorder , and deepening poverty , particularly in developing countries .  
The primary threat to humankind is now posed not by the possibility of the eruption of a nuclear conflict between the major Powers , but by regional crises of a national , ethnic or religious nature .  
It is true that some of them have been successfully resolved , but many others , of an ethnic , racial and religious nature , are arising in various parts of the world and are raging unabated , rendering the world situation fragile and precarious .  
In flagrant defiance of international humanitarian law , crimes such as " ethnic cleansing " , mass rapes , torture and deliberate bombing of civilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent Bosnian people .  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
The recent dramatic increase in natural and man-made disasters and civil and ethnic strife has made an effective and coordinated response by the international community absolutely essential .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
In some regions of Europe , Africa and Asia , religious , ethnic , tribal and border conflicts , often of tragic proportions , are still raging , thus making the international situation unstable and fragile .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
Concerning article 5 of the Convention , members requested further information about enjoyment of the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights set out in article 5 of the Convention , having regard to the country 's various ethnic groups .  
They requested additional information on the numerous internal conflicts and ethnic violence and their causes , and concerning the recent suspension of basic guarantees for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights .  
The Committee underlined that nondiscrimination in the enjoyment of fundamental , civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights must be effectively guaranteed in law and actively protected in practice if further ethnic unrest was to be avoided .  
For 20 months we have been spectators helpless spectators of aggression , territorial conquest , " ethnic cleansing " , intolerance of every kind , and continuing massive , flagrant , systematic violations of human rights .  
If the existence of the numerous mass graves situated at or near identified detention facilities were to be confirmed , such confirmation would be relevant to the inquiry into " ethnic cleansing " ( see paras .  129150 ) .  
Promoting the socioeconomic status of disadvantaged ethnic , cultural , occupational or religious groups is also difficult owing to a lack of effective and acceptable means of intervention .  
In other words , " collective responsibility " a primitive and archaic concept will gain the upper hand ; eventually whole groups will be held guilty of massacres , torture , rape , ethnic cleansing , the wanton destruction of cities and villages .  
The Governments concerned should therefore set goals for the reversal of that tendency by educating the public to accept cultural , ethnic and religious diversity with a view to promoting communal harmony and understanding .  
However , most countries were composed of distinct ethnic , linguistic , religious and cultural minorities , and it was necessary to balance respect for the rights of minorities and preservation of national unity and territorial integrity .  
It fully shared the concern of the international community at the human rights violations committed in that country , and condemned the practices of ethnic cleansing and the acts of violence whose origins lay in racial hatred .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
The same was true in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , where ethnic cleansing , genocide and violations of the most fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law were being committed by the Serbs .  
Organized crime , drug trafficking , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
The root causes of global conflicts had been aggravated by ethnic , religious and intercommunal divisions , which required a just and lasting radical solution in order to ensure that desperation and insecurity did not lead to insurmountable social crises .  
Hungary strongly condemned the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq , where the Government was implicated in summary executions , political killings , systematic torture and the repression of ethnic and religious minorities .  
Hungary remained extremely concerned about continuing human rights violations , including extrajudicial and summary executions , widespread detention , torture , forced labour and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities .  
There is no doubt that humanitarian law has been violated and that cultural monuments have been destroyed by all three parties in the tragic civil , ethnic and religious war in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
But as ethnic conflicts spread and political solutions become more elusive , there is a risk that humanitarian operations could become prolonged , draining limited resources and causing untold suffering .  
The representative informed the members of the Committee that , in April 1993 , the maximum period for suspension of a radio or television broadcasting permit , referred to in paragraph 28 of the report , had been increased from one year to five years .  Updating the figures contained in paragraph 45 of the report , the representative informed the Committee that , in 1992 , five persons had been convicted of agitating against an ethnic group , and two of illegal discrimination .  
They emphasized the fact that the Moroccan nation was historically and constitutionally a single indivisible whole , but they wondered why censuses and studies carried out by the authorities employed only socio-economic and not racial , ethnic or linguistic criteria , which would give a more complete idea of the composition of the population .  
High levels of poverty and unemployment , lack of distributive justice , social unrest arising from ethnic , cultural and minority differences and powerful vested interests that need to be contained remain barriers , and these must be addressed continuously and simultaneously .  
They justify the drafting of new international instruments to complete the existing legal arsenal , so that those who continue to perpetrate cruel and inhuman acts , genocide and ethnic cleansing can be punished .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
We have come to realize the growing importance of effective regional tools in addressing this new type of mostly internal conflicts , where the rule of law and accountable national administrations are often non-existent , where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders lead campaigns of intimidation , ethnic cleansing and genocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is suffering the consequences of Belgrade 's ambition to create a Greater Serbia inspired by the philosophy of national chauvinism , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the forceful changing of borders lies at the centre of the present-day Balkan crisis , concentrated in the former Yugoslavia . 
After more than three years of crimes of murder , destruction and ethnic cleansing that have continued to be committed by the Serbian forces against the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , a new turning-point has emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations that have led to a preliminary agreement on the fundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement based on the decisions of international legality .  
Although numerous resolutions of the Security Council reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia , confirming the inadmissibility of the annexation of territory by force and condemning ethnic cleansing have been adopted , the reaction of the international community to the challenge posed by the Serbs has always been hesitant and confused .  
Years of apartheid rule have bequeathed the overwhelming majority black population with a heavy legacy of poverty , social disintegration and political cleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities .  
The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis strongly condemns the outrageous and cowardly acts of genocide , ethnic cleansing and indiscriminate killing of the innocent and helpless , on all sides in this brutal conflict .  
At the same time , though , there is a growing danger of armed conflicts breaking out because of continuing economic , political , territorial , ethnic , religious and other imbalances in relations between States .  
The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through respect for different ethnic , religious , cultural and political identities , through an efficient system of collective security , and through respect for a law-governed State and international law .  
International conflicts have been replaced by internal ones , characterized by political , economic , ethnic and religious tensions that often imply grave humanitarian crises and human rights violations .  
However , the threats of a world cataclysm have grown over decades of regional and local conflicts , stirred up by a wide range of motives involving geopolitical , economic and trading disputes as well as ethnic and religious conflicts .  
None the less , reality has shown that these aspirations have not been met and that , on the contrary , changes in the international system created conditions that have unleashed forces that had long been held in check , giving rise to new conflicts and rivalries , not only as a result of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of serious ethnic , religious , social and cultural differences which have jeopardized peace and international security . 
However , the lack of political will to suppress aggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with United Nations decisions , coupled with the unreasonable , immoral and legally baseless insistence by some on extending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia to the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the Serbs that they can continue with impunity their murder , destruction , aggression , ethnic cleansing and genocide .  
The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
At the social level it is indisputable that intolerance of racial , religious , ethnic , language and gender differences is exploited by groups which seek to attain or maintain economic and political power over others .  
No sooner had bloc confrontation and tension decreased than the international community started to face a dramatic increase of tension and conflict based on ethnic , racial , religious or national prejudice - tension which thrived on rekindling or reviving animosities that had been extinguished or dormant for many , many years . 
Since prejudice denotes an irrational , unfavourable or hostile attitude towards members of other racial , religious or ethnic groups , we must , if we truly desire its defeat , engage ourselves in promoting , enhancing and defending the universal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
We see with great concern how ethnic , geographical and utopian myths and revisionisms are becoming a boundless source of suffering for millions of men and women in our time , gravely disturbing fragile international balances .  
However , we have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable suffering , to shameful operations of so-called ethnic cleansing and to crimes against humanity , which the international community was unable to prevent and before which it remained passive .  
However , severe problems of unemployment , poverty and income distribution have grown worse in many places , contributing to political instability , mass migration , environmental stress , and ethnic conflict .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
While the human rights situation had improved in various parts of the world , it had grown much worse in the former Yugoslavia , particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina , where the policy of ethnic cleansing , accompanied by inhuman practices of unprecedented violence , had led to the exodus of entire populations and caused countless victims .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
The National Working Committee on Children and Women , established under the State Council for monitoring the NPA , will mobilize leaders at key administrative levels to strengthen programme delivery , allocate adequate resources , support local mobilization action and monitor implementation of the NPA . 59 .  In poor counties and ethnic minority areas , empowerment activities will be adapted to the local culture , knowledge and needs .  
She referred to the latest report of the Special Rapporteur , which confirmed the persistence of grave human rights violations , the systematic and daily slaughter of innocent people , the odious practice of ethnic cleansing and forced resettlement , even in the so-called " security " zones .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Recognize and respect cultural , ethnic and religious diversity , and promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities ; and take measures to facilitate their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and social development in their country ;  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , and in particular at those committed in the context of the continuing , odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which is the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims are the Muslim population , threatened with virtual extermination , as well as the Croats and non-Serbs ,  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
In particular , the United States indicated that it understands that the term " intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group as such " , as used in the Convention , means the " specific intent to destroy , in whole or substantial part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group as such " by the acts prohibited in the Convention .  
Despite numerous reminders about the Geneva Conventions and calls upon Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue as cited by your report of 22 March 1995 , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims . 
Despite the numerous reminders citing the Geneva Conventions and the calls upon the Serbian military and political leadership to halt and reverse their practice of ethnic cleansing , these crimes continue , abated only by the rapidly decreasing number of potential human victims as is , in fact , pointed out in the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } report of 22 March 1995 .  
Both the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb authorities must exercise the maximum restraint and must realize once and for all that there can be no military solution to the conflict , only a comprehensive political solution such as will restore the peaceful coexistence of the various ethnic , cultural and religious components that have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
In spite of some notable progress in democratization and popular participation in some African countries , a number of others remain embroiled in ethnic conflicts , political upheavals and civil wars which have resulted in a humanitarian tragedy of unprecedented proportions .  
Systematic violation of human rights and freedoms : mass arrests , abductions and murders , pent-up political trials , forcible mobilizations , evictions and ethnic cleansing , plunder , disrespect of religious freedoms , not acknowledging of national and religious institutions of the Bosniac-Moslems .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;  
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
Having been instigated by Belgrade to serve as an instrument in a genocidal campaign against their neighbours and having been influenced by an incessant anti-Croatian propaganda campaign from Belgrade , many of these ethnic Serbs - even though most are not personally responsible for the crimes committed - have decided to leave rather than face their surviving neighbours who are returning to live in the region .  
The United Nations must never again permit itself to be reduced to a passive observer or , even worse , an obedient assistant to the Pale regime in their final act of ethnic cleansing .  
Those who not only advocate but brutally carry out the policy of ethnic cleansing , national and religious superiority and the physical elimination of a people combined with the destruction of the traces of their centuries-old existence and the expropriation of their land and all other belongings , must not be treated in the same way as those who fight for religious equality , tolerance , coexistence , human rights and freedom .  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
The failures of the international community in providing protection to the people of Bosnia , in halting policies of ethnic cleansing , as constituting a war crime and a crime against humanity , and in ending the deliberate obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian assistance mean that we must reconsider the maintenance of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia with a view to enabling its people to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is very disappointed that the Security Council did not most resolutely condemn the Croatian aggression and the crimes committed , particularly ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of fundamental norms of international humanitarian law , human rights and the principles of international law in times of war , in the light of the horrible crimes that the Croatian army committed against Serbian civilians and prisoners of war .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
The " ethnic cleansing " of ethnic Croats and Bosniacs in these regions , which has been occurring for many months , continues unabated and without any real attempt by the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) and the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as international humanitarian and other organizations to take effective preventive measures .  
The Government of the Republic of Croatia is concerned that the magnitude of the human rights abuses against ethnic Croats in the " Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) " as well as in the remaining occupied territories of Croatia and in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Serbs will increase and that this can only raise tensions and hinder the establishment of a lasting peace in the region .  
" [ All forms of gender-based violence , including those resulting from all forms of sexual harassment , prostitution , pornography , sexual slavery and exploitation , including those violations resulting from cultural prejudice , racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia , ethnic cleansing , religious and anti-religious extremism and international trafficking in women and children , are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and must be eliminated . ] "  Fifth sentence .  
The commission of inquiry might be of assistance here as well inasmuch as it might make recommendations concerning appropriate legal , political or administrative measures , for such measures are probably necessary if Burundi is in the future to avoid not only the vortex of Rwanda , but also the twin dangers of a dictatorship based on the predominant majority of one ethnic group as well as a dictatorship based on a firepower monopoly of the other ethnic group . 
The declaration on the historical reconciliation between Romania and Hungary may be accompanied by a juridical bilateral document laying down the mechanisms and instruments , as well as a code of conduct on issues of ethnic minorities , which the two countries would agree to establish in order to attain these goals , as well as by concrete programmes of action at political , economic , strategic , cultural levels , and in other fields of common interest .  
As far as Croatia is concerned such peaceful settlements imply complete restoration of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders , with full guarantees of minority rights given to the Serbian ethnic community in Croatia accompanied , should there be a need , by international monitoring .  
The tense situation existing there , resulting from the exacerbation of political and ethnic problems , is significantly aggravated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees , which is creating a real threat to peace and stability for all the countries of the region .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Urge the identification and condemnation of the systematic practice of rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women as a deliberate instrument of war and ethnic cleansing and take steps to ensure that full assistance is provided to the victims of such abuse for their physical and mental rehabilitation ;  
Massive violations of human rights , especially in the form of genocide , " ethnic cleansing " as a strategy of war and its consequences , rape , including systematic rape of women in war situations , creating mass exodus of refugees and displaced persons , are abhorrent practices that are strongly condemned and must be immediately stopped , while perpetrators of such crimes must be punished .  
" We have promoted racial understanding , and sought to guarantee to everyone , without distinction as to race , colour , national or ethnic origin , the right to equality before the law in civil , political and economic rights .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
States should be less restrictive and more liberal in the granting of visas to nationals of countries of the South and call on their populations to be more receptive to foreigners and to cultural interchange .  181 .  In the short term , as the United Nations strives for peace on several fronts , radical measures are urgently needed to curb radio stations that promote ethnic or racial hatred and to suppress clandestine radio stations which engage in such activities .

NULLThe Governments of Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Dominica , Mauritius , Morocco , the Russian Federation and Ukraine recognized the existence of national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minority groups on their respective territories , and mentioned the relevant constitutional and legislative provisions protecting them .  
In addition , the Commission decided to authorize the request of the Subcommission , contained in resolution 1994 / 4 , to establish , initially for a three-year period , an intersessional working group consisting of five of its members to meet each year for five working days in order to promote the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , and in particular to :  
In this multidimensional context , the question of the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities is of overriding importance for the respect of human rights generally and central to the promotion of understanding , tolerance and solidarity between and among communities and Governments .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
NULLIn a number of cases , special rapporteurs appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries and on thematic issues have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
In his report on the mission he undertook to the United States of America ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 78 / Add . 1 ) , " The Special Rapporteur found sociological inertia , structural obstacles and individual resistance hindering the emergence of an integrated society based on the equal dignity of the members of the American nation and willing to accept ethnic and cultural pluralism " ( para .  NULL  
NULLThe Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 61 ) mentioned that in a number of cases that had come before him in 1994 , it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
However , health and educational services remain impaired by continuous ethnic turmoil , forcing the international community to set up parallel administrative structures .  
In practical terms , the campaign against racism and xenophobia must be carried out by developing educational programmes , punishing those responsible for such practices , opening up new opportunities for members of racial and ethnic minorities and ensuring , at all levels , respect for human dignity .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racial violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Ensure that the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic and other minorities are protected , and that such persons are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  
It should be obvious from the above that the Greek Cypriots are among the least qualified people to talk of respect for " human rights " when successive reports of the Secretary-General and international press reports attest to the fact that during the period 1963-1974 there was a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people by the Greek Cypriot side .  
The appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance indicated the deep concern raised in the international community by those tendencies , among which " ethnic cleansing " gave special cause for alarm .  
In his country , whose population reflected an ethnic mixture created by successive waves of migrants , his Government had systematically extended moral , political and material support to all peoples struggling against racial discrimination and apartheid .  
After having undertaken a drastic policy of ethnic cleansing against Serbs , the Croatian authorities are already calling into question the Serbs ' right to be represented in Parliament , the Government , regional and other authorities because for that aspect of political life they do not fulfil the new condition of representing the prescribed 8 per cent in Croatia 's total population .  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
The continued gross violations of human rights , the ethnic cleansing and the forcible return of refugees and displaced persons underline the importance of a firm commitment by all parties to human rights and humanitarian principles , and of international monitoring to ensure their compliance .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
It is expected of the international community to respond to the biggest ethnic cleansing carried out so far in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , following Croatia 's brutal aggression against the Serb Krajina and after joint Muslim-Croat attacks on traditionally Serb ethnic territories in western and north-western Bosnia , even after a cease-fire agreement was announced .

Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious , and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;

note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
The serious and massive occurrence of discriminatory and repressive practices aimed at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , as a whole , resulting in widespread involuntary migration ; and noting also that the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , in its resolutions 1993 / 9 of 20 August 1993 and 1995 / 10 of 18 August 1995 , considered that those measures and practices constituted a form of ethnic cleansing ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
adds a dramatic picture of new , appalling violations of humanitarian law that have taken place more recently in the Banja Luka region : a large-scale resumption of ethnic cleansing ; new cases of persons unaccounted for ; and chilling evidence , discovered in Sanski Most , of mass executions .  
of those who , with a level of savage brutality that shames the world , revived genocidal practices , perpetrated ethnic cleansing , committed abominable human rights violations or flouted the norms of humanitarian law will now have to face the consequences of their behaviour .  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
She drew attention to the current problem of the forced displacement of persons within Sri Lanka and attributed that situation to the actions of a secessionist group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , which earlier in 1995 had turned its back on the option for settling the country 's ethnic issues through a process of peaceful negotiations , an option freely supported by all other political parties and groups in the country and welcomed by the international community .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
VOLSKI ( Georgia ) said that his country 's traditions and culture were a clear example of the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and religions and that the current obstacle to ensuring fundamental human rights was the grave economic and social situation .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
National chauvinism ; ethnic intolerance ; racial , economic and religious discrimination ; ethnic cleansing ; and acts of violence and repression against an entire population characteristic features of Serb policy were demonstrated for the first time in Kosovo .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
With a population of fewer than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic and linguistic origins , 80 per cent of whom live in rural settings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1,600 kilometres of ocean , no other system is workable .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
With regard to the situation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , double standards were evident , with certain countries demanding air strikes in retaliation for ethnic cleansing committed by one side , while turning a blind eye to identical acts committed by the other sides .  
In a climate of growing radicalization , extremists from the two main ethnic groups in the country are engaged in a round of violence that includes selective killings , massacres of civilians and the destruction of national economic assets and infrastructure .  
The representative of Norway had said that one of the most difficult challenges facing the international community was the question of ensuring respect for the rights of persons belonging to ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities , while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of States .

In taking gradual steps towards reconciliation , the Government maintains that the main demands of the ethnic Albanian community ( i.e . status as a constituent nation ; university-level education to be conducted in Albanian , including the establishment of a special university at Tetovo ; proportional representation in all institutions of public life ; and recognition of Albanian as a second official language ) can not be met immediately on constitutional grounds or for reasons of time to rectify the situation .  
At the same time , it is recognized that in a longer perspective the litmus test of internal peace and stability will be the ability of all social , ethnic and political groups in the country to advance effective processes for the construction of a civil society capable of solving disputes through legal , peaceful means .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Unsolved problems relating to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities are widely recognized as a major source of international and internal conflicts involving widespread human rights violations .  
Condemns all forms of ethnic violence and intolerance , which are among the major causes of forced displacements , as well as an impediment to durable solutions to refugee problems , and appeals to States to combat intolerance , racism and xenophobia and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements , appropriate legislation and social policies , especially with regard to the special situation of refugees and asylum-seekers ;  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole of the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development in their country ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing , which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population , as well as the Croats and others ,  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
The key elements of the plan included an agreed ratio of IPTF to Federation police in the various areas ; the issuance of special identity cards for Federation police authorized and cleared by IPTF ; a change in the composition of the Federation police in each suburb to reflect the ethnic mix of the population according to the 1991 census ; IPTF authorization of Federation police check-points ; and requests in advance for searches of houses or private property .  
The closed nature of ethnic communal groups , enhanced by language barriers and an often imported distrust of the police , make immigrant communities in many countries ideal recruiting and operating grounds for criminal organizations .  
Full account had to be taken of economic conditions ; social , ethnic , cultural , religious or legal situations ; conjugal circumstances ; the nature and type of relations characterized by violence ; and conditions of political persecution , social oppression , racial discrimination and unequal economic development , as well as violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
Urge all those involved in the implementation process to undertake urgent and effective measures to stop the tendency of ethnic partition of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and draw the attention of the international community to the serious threat to the stability of the entire Balkan region as a result of the prevailing tendency to support ethnic instead of democratic forces ;  
The two sides are in favour of the continued promotion of friendly exchanges among the people of various countries so as to enhance mutual understanding and confidence , and are against stirring up national , ethnic and religious conflicts .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requests the heads of diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations to report objectively about what they have seen to the Governments , nations or organizations that they represent and give them an accurate account of what is taking place in Burundi : recognized crimes against innocent populations , women , children and defenceless patients can not be mistaken for a struggle for democracy or the liberation of an ethnic group , or presented simply as inter-ethnic confrontation or fighting between the army and the rebels .  
With regard to the religious and ethnic violence prompted by the failure of the Indonesian Government to resolve the social , political and economic issues that lay at the heart of the human rights problems , three major riots had taken place in 1995 .  The first and last had been sparked by deliberate acts of incitement against Catholicism , the dominant religion in East Timor .  
Massive or persistent violations of human rights , often the result of ethnic , racial or religious tensions or unequal access to power and basic necessities of life will continue to endanger international peace and security and to hamper economic and social development .  
The Criminal Act prescribes punishment in the form of a fine , simple detention or imprisonment for up to two years for any person who , publicly or with the intent of propagating them to a wider circle , makes statements or any other communication by which a group of persons is threatened , insulted or exposed to indignities on the grounds of race , colour , national extraction , ethnic origin , religion or sexual orientation ( cf . sect .  266 B of the Act ) .  
According to the Act on Prohibition of Discrimination Owing to Race , etc . a person who , while performing occupational or non-profit activities , refuses to serve another person under the same conditions as others , owing to the other person 's race , colour , national extraction , ethnic origin , religion or sexual orientation , is punishable with a fine , simple detention or imprisonment for up to six months .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
Communal violence , understood as acts of violence committed by one ethnic , religious , linguistic , national or social group against another group , was reported in Bangladesh , Burundi , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Mali , Nigeria and Somalia . Government forces are often said to support one side in the conflict or even instigate hostilities , rather than intervene to stop violence between different groups .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
The basic objective of the project is to contribute to the progressive elimination of opium cultivation by the Hmong ethnic group in a remote area through the introduction of sustainable social and economic development processes ;  
For human rights education not to be theoretical , but to be relevant to people 's experience and , therefore , rooted in the historical , social , psychological , ethnic , gender , linguistic and other contexts of the learners ;  
The Government of Mauritius stated that the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities were guaranteed through a combination of constitutional provisions , which were fully compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , statutory legislation and common law .  
The Government of Austria reported that ethnic groups were represented at the national level by ethnic councils whose aim it was to further the collective cultural , social and economic interests of the various ethnic groups in Austria .  
In addition , a special State programme had been drawn up to address the cultural , spiritual , educational and socio-economic problems of the 12-million ethnic Ukrainians living abroad .  
It was emphasized that the establishment and maintenance of unimpeded contacts among persons belonging to a national minority , as well as contacts across frontiers by persons belonging to a national minority with persons with whom they share a common ethnic or national origin , cultural heritage or religious belief , contributes to mutual understanding and promotes good neighbourly relations .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
Those included activities using the education for development approach in the areas of advocacy and training ; research studies by the International Child Development Centre in Florence , Italy ; workshops that addressed issues of religious , ethnic and cultural discrimination ; and dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the public in numerous local languages .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
He stated that none of the criteria used to define ethnic groups or national minorities were applicable to Burundi , since for centuries Hutus and Tutsis had occupied the same geographical area , shared the same religious beliefs and spoken the same language .  
On the matter of internal deportations and forced relocations , the Special Rapporteur concluded that government policies violated the freedoms of movement and residence and , in some cases , constitute discriminatory practices based on ethnic or religious affiliations .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The seminar recognized that it is vital that States Members of the United Nations promote awareness of the threat posed to the stability of national and international order by the propagation of ethnic hatred , ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin , and by racist propaganda and activities .  
The Greek Ministry of Justice reported that the Greek Constitution and legislation fully safeguard both equality in the enjoyment of fundamental individual and social rights and freedoms for all citizens irrespective of race , colour , religion and ethnic or national origin ( art . 5 ) , and freedom of religious conscience .  
A penal component , prohibiting any racial , ethnic or religious discrimination against an individual or community and strengthening the penalties to be handed down on conviction for racist offences by adding deprivation of civil rights for 5 to 10 years ;  
Whereas the current situation in eastern Zaire is purely internal , the international community can not remain aloof without seeking solutions aimed at halting the intensification of ethnic cleansing and genocide in eastern Zaire .  
Because of the short time-frame and the higher level of technical skill required , prior experience was found to be necessary , and a total of 62 men of different ethnic backgrounds were employed .  
In addition , the authorities have repeatedly stated their commitment to equality and non-discrimination , and it was apparent in the discussions of the Representative with government officials at both the central and local level that they were making efforts to ensure that the law was being applied to persons of all ethnic groups in an equal manner .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
In recent years , owing to fragmentation of States into newly independent countries , the twin problems of forced relocation of populations and mass expulsions , including the so-called " ethnic cleansing " operations , have resulted in the involuntary displacement of millions of people as well as considerable suffering and loss of life and property .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
Mr . BAALI ( Algeria ) said that the origin of the dramatic events currently taking place in the world lay , even more than in colonialism and the disintegration of communism , in the resurgence of violence provoked by the exacerbation of nationalistic , ethnic , religious and tribal sentiments and fed by foreign intervention . 
Moreover , the willingness and psychological capacity of the developed countries to provide asylum and support were diminishing ; that had been reflected in decreased aid and an increase in restrictive practices that circumscribed the right of asylum , particularly if persons happened to be from different ethnic or cultural backgrounds . 
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
Resurgent nationalism and the rejection of religious , cultural , ethnic and ideological diversity were being expressed in ethnic conflict , growing violence and the proliferation of racist and xenophobic practices in various parts of the world .  
He was satisfied with the definition of crimes against humanity , which was based on the notion that there was no nexus between that category of crimes and a state of war , and was especially pleased that institutionalized discrimination on racial , ethnic or religious grounds was included in that category . 
The United States had also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ; the latter should be a very valuable tool as the international community responded to humanitarian and human rights crises born of racial and ethnic animosities .  
While the international community was giving considerable attention to the promotion and protection of human rights , and while the international and regional human rights mechanisms had therefore gained in effectiveness , it nevertheless had to be recognized that much more needed to be done to check the wave of reported and noted violations , especially in view of the geopolitical instability , regional and ethnic conflicts and recent social turmoil .  
His Government was deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards democratization and the continuing violation of human rights in Myanmar , particularly the continuing detention of political prisoners under very harsh conditions , the use of forced labour , the forced displacement of ethnic communities and the ongoing harassment of those engaged in legitimate political activity .  
As regards the Greek Cypriot side 's self-portrayal as the victimized party in the Cyprus question , I wish to underline that there is ample graphic evidence in the form of reports by the Secretary-General and the international press that during the years between 1963 and 1974 a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing was directed by the Greek Cypriots against their former Turkish Cypriot partners in Cyprus .  
Regrettably , the world continued to be confronted by civil strife , ethnic cleansing , lawlessness and extreme poverty , all of which posed a considerable challenge to the full enjoyment of human rights .  
Relevant disaggregated information ( for example , by gender , age , region , rural / urban areas and social and ethnic origin ) should be given on children having benefited from any of these measures and resources allocated to them ( at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels ) .  
To ensure appropriate prenatal and post _ natal health care for mothers , indicating the nature of services provided , including appropriate information given , the coverage ensured , the rate of mortality and its main causes ( average and disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , region , urban / rural area , social and ethnic origin ) , the proportion of pregnant women who have access to and benefit from pre _ and post _ natal health care , trained personnel and hospital care and delivery ;

Reports should also identify , inter alia , the mechanisms established and the programmes and activities developed for that purpose , as well as the education and vocational training provided , and indicate relevant disaggregated data on the children concerned , including by age , gender , region , rural / urban area , and social and ethnic origin .  
Please provide information on the measures adopted , including at the legislative , administrative , educational , budgetary and social levels , to ensure that a child belonging to an ethnic , religious or linguistic minority or who is indigenous is not denied the right , in community with other members of his or her group :  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
The main principles of his Government 's policy in that area were to ensure equality of constitutional rights and freedoms to all citizens , to strengthen legal safeguards against discrimination , extremism and intolerance , to promote mutual trust among ethnic groups and respect for their language and cultures , and to create conditions that would enable all citizens to express their ethnic , cultural and religious identities freely . 
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
With regard to racial discrimination , his delegation naturally condemned racial violence , xenophobia and racism , but could not accept a failure to take account of the flagrant violations of the rights of peoples represented by colonialism , foreign occupation , genocide , ethnic cleansing , and the hatred voiced of Arabs , Africans , Asians and the peoples of Latin America , all issues which were not broached in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance . 
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 117 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law , and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
In the face of reassertion of ethnic - some may call it tribal - identities , of revival of neo-liberal ideas based on extreme individualism and deregulation , as well as of other centrifugal forces , it becomes imperative at the international level to insist on general , as opposed to particular , State interests and to work towards the development of a public order of the international community .  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
The new , restructured MINUGUA will oversee an unprecedented transformation in the political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security life of Guatemala .  
The signature of this most recent Agreement makes effective all the previous agreements signed by the parties , which cover complex political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public-security questions . 
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
Unfortunately , in our world there remain conflicts , violence , ethnic strife , religious intolerance , terrorism , drug trafficking , corruption , poverty , unjust international economic relations and a heavy external debt that continues to prove overwhelming .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
Throughout the past few years , successive world events have indicated that disasters caused by people resorting to armed force in their ethnic , civil , ideological or border wars have been increasing in a manner unprecedented in modern history .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
They include poverty and growing economic imbalances in and between countries ; rising unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world ; environmental degradation ; war and civil strife ; intensified domestic and international conflicts for political , religious or ethnic reasons ; disparities in economic development and income levels ; globalization ; labour market demands ; and increased international trade and investment .  
Furthermore , in areas inhabited by a considerable number ( one quarter ) of members of an ethnic group , designations and inscriptions of a topographical nature set up by territorial authorities and public agencies must be bilingual .  
In specifically identified primary and secondary compulsory schools located in the traditional area of settlement of an ethnic group , this right is ensured for every member of the ethnic minority regardless of the number of pupils participating , and in primary and secondary compulsory schools located outside the traditional settlement area minority language instruction is provided where there is a demand , requiring a minimum number of participants which varies between four and nine .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
While the international community was watching without taking proper action , the systematic policy of " ethnic cleansing " operations , planned and carried out by nationalistic politicians , military and paramilitary groups as well as civilians who were themselves victims of racist propaganda , resulted in the mass exodus of more than 2-million refugees and internally displaced persons , in the death of more than 200,000 human beings , in the economic destruction of vast areas of the region , and in the most horrendous acts of torture , systematic rape and similar expressions of barbarity .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
Each of the High Contracting Parties guarantees to nationals of the other Parties resident in its territory , regardless of their ethnic affiliation , religion or other differences , social , economic and cultural rights and freedoms in accordance with universally accepted international human rights standards .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
This ensures that the principles embodied in international labour standards are taken into account in the work of other organizations dealing with issues of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , racial and sex discrimination , the rights of ethnic minorities and the rights of children , inter alia .  
In its continuous search for new channels for promoting and protecting human rights , the National Commission had initiated contacts with religious bodies , and had become deeply involved in investigating inter _ ethnic land conflicts which had assumed alarming dimensions .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
With regard to the full implementation of the principles laid down by articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 12 in the Convention , the Committee suggests that the State party fully integrate them in all its policies , laws , actions and programmes affecting children at all levels , including on the administrative and judicial levels , especially with regard to children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups , the girl child , disabled children and children living in rural and remote areas .  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Also strongly urges the Government of Myanmar to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and assembly , the right to fair trial and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities , and to put an end to violations of the right to life and integrity of the human being , to the practices of torture , abuse of women , forced labour and forced relocations and to enforced disappearances and summary executions ;  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
It encompasses detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues which have been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
It encompassed detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which had been bound together into a comprehensive national agenda .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the fall of apartheid and despite continuing efforts to combat these phenomena , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of racially motivated violence , persist and are even growing in magnitude , adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia , against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities , Gravely concerned about reports that these practices have frequently been carried out by agents under government authority or have taken place with the knowledge of the Government of the Sudan ,  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
The international community of States ( the United Nations , OSCE , CIS and the European Parliament ) , in condemning the policy of " ethnic cleansing " in the form of mass extermination and forcible expulsion of the predominantly Georgian population of Abkhazia , has affirmed the unacceptability of refusing to allow them to return to Abkhazia and of forcibly changing the demographic composition of Abkhazia , Georgia . 
While the reduction in the Georgian population was caused by ethnic cleansing and forcible deportation , the reduction in the Abkhaz population is the result of migration processes resulting from the current economic and political chaos in Abkhazia , unbearable living conditions and the crime situation .  
From all the above , the relevant changes in the demographic situation in Abkhazia may be clearly observed , as a result of the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by the Ardzinba regime in the occupied territories - and still continuing - directed primarily against the Georgian population .  * A / 52 / 50 .  
The ethnic factor , in conjunction with other political , economic , historical and cultural factors , is eating away at the fragile political ties in Africa , with the harrowing consequences of confrontation _ whose main victims are civilian populations _ and a resurgence of the crime of genocide .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
Collective expulsions or population transfers usually target national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities and thus , prima facie , violate individual as well as collective rights contained in several important international human rights instruments , in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Before the astonished eyes of a silent public , we have in recent years been able to " see " the gravest violations of the right to life for ethnic and racial motives , death from hunger in atrocious conditions of thousands upon thousands of children and people of all ages , in short , atrocities that in the old world with less intercommunication only came to be known many years later through books and distant reports , and were sometimes never known at all by the public .  
While there are many similarities between the practice of forced evictions and internal displacement , population transfer , mass expulsions , mass exodus , ethnic cleansing and other practices involving the coerced and involuntary movement of people from their homes , lands and communities , forced evictions constitute a distinct practice under international law .  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
A reign of terror has been let loose , characterized by extrajudicial executions , indiscriminate killings , random and mass arrests for political reasons , forced relocation of the population , gang rapes of women and systematic efforts to obliterate the ethnic , social and cultural identity of the Kashmiri people .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
A public sector that is either too weak or too large can lead to serious ethnic , religious , political and economic conflicts , undermining sound governance and efforts to promote human development .  
It was regrettable that racial hatred , intolerance , ethnic persecution and unchecked political ambitions were continuing to cause conflicts leading to such mass movements .  
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
The international community was currently facing different , although not unfamiliar , problems , namely , the break-up of political entities , conflicts based on religious ideology , the repercussions of the apartheid policies applied in the past and human rights violations engendered by racial and ethnic hatred .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
Equal attention was being paid to the renaissance and free development of the Ukrainian nation and to the promotion and protection of the spiritual and cultural heritage of other ethnic , linguistic and religious groups living in Ukraine .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The devastation and the destruction , as well as the human tragedy resulting from years and years of unrelenting ethnic hatred , witnessed in the fragmented former Yugoslavia ; the division of Cyprus ; the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , which continue to have far-reaching effects on neighbouring countries ; the recent turmoil in Albania ; and political instability in some countries because of rampant extremist fundamentalist elements , these are matters of great concern to all the littoral States of the Mediterranean .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
In resolution 1997 / 57 , section IX , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on the prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and other vulnerable groups , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
That mandate is underlined by the Secretary-General in paragraph 11 of his report submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which he recalled that the Council had condemned the practice of ethnic cleansing and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts .  
At its fiftieth session , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 182 of 22 December 1995 , entitled Human rights and mass exoduses , in which it , inter alia , acknowledged that mass exoduses of populations were caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation .  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 1997 / 57 in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to focus her future activities on prevention and reporting of violations of , and lack of action to protect , all human rights and fundamental freedoms by governmental authorities , particularly violations that exacerbate ethnic tension , and on protecting the rights of persons belonging to minorities , women and vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly , particularly their right to return to their homes in safety and dignity .  
Deeply concerned that despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grown in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Calls upon the Government of Myanmar and other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully the obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , [ 8 ] to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail itself of such services as may be offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
It should be borne in mind that the expanded verification role of MINUGUA covers a package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and URNG , which include detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which are bound together into a national peace agenda . 
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Now we are practically the only country of the Commonwealth of Independent States that had a stable economic growth of about 16 per cent during the first half of this year ; we have arrested the decrease in volumes of industrial production and we are a country free from religious , ethnic or civil strife . 
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
There is strong dissatisfaction in the international community about the fact that while we have a fully functional Tribunal in The Hague , the military and political leaders responsible for the grave violations of humanitarian law and the acts of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain free .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
We hope that the OSCE mission in Bosnia will continue to work in close contact with relevant United Nations structures and specialized agencies in resolving such vital matters as protection of the rights of ethnic minorities , the problems of refugees , and the normal functioning of municipal authorities .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
The basic principles governing these programmes were to respect and preserve , through bicultural education , the ethnic identity of each of the seven Mayan language groups , guaranteeing their legal stay and security in Mexico , until such time as they individually expressed their preference for voluntary repatriation , and to offer them a standard of living and opportunities for development and work equivalent to those of the Mexican population living in the same area .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
In Africa , America , Asia , Europe and the Pacific , discriminatory barriers are being thrown up against men and women who , looking for a better life , set out in hopes of finding a place in what is said to be the global village but turns out to have neighbourhoods closed off to some by legislation alluding directly or indirectly to racial identity , national or ethnic origin or preference for nationals .  
Although pre _ colonial Rwanda was inhabited by the same peoples as are found there today , namely , the Hutus ( of Bantu origin ) , the Tutsi ( of Hamitic descent ) and the Twas ( pymoid type ) , these three peoples , organized in more or less autonomous kingdoms , did not constitute opposing dominant and dominated ethnic groups . 
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
We , the representatives of the Serbian ethnic community , are convinced that in the sense of the aforementioned we have not even hypothesized a possibility of diminishing or limiting the relevant civil rights of the present and future inhabitants of the region under the Transitional Administration in the Republic of Croatia .  
There is also discrimination with regard to the effective enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights , by other ethnic groups , in flagrant violation of articles 2.2 , 2.3 , 3 , 4 and 5 of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , adopted by General Assembly resolution 47 / 135 .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
All Sudanese citizens living in areas controlled by the Government of the Sudan are potential victims of human rights violations and abuses , regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic origin or social status , once they are considered to be opponents of the Government of the Sudan , or even suspected of being in disagreement with its political agenda .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
The degree of enjoyment of both civil and political as well as economic , social and cultural rights has altered significantly among the various segments of the Afghan population ; gender and ethnic origin have become important determining factors regarding the degree of enjoyment of human rights in certain parts of the country .  
In East Timor , a wide range of human rights violations continued to take place during the last year , compounded by increasing incidents of political , religious and ethnic violence .  
It should be noted that while ethnic and religious identities have not played a significant role in the conflict , there has been a feeling in the northern and central parts of the country that their economic and cultural interests have been neglected by the Government .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , including through the facilitation of their full participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Also concerned about reports of ideological indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , especially but not exclusively affecting displaced families and women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , continue to persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Foreign aggression , ethnic conflicts , and massive human rights abuses continued to threaten the territorial integrity of newly independent States in the region leading to enormous suffering and grief .  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination , inter alia against Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , negrophobia , anti _ Semitism and related intolerance continue to persist and even to grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,

Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The entire northern third of the country is hostile to Islamabad , and the more the northern forces continue their advance into Taliban-controlled territory , the greater will be the destabilizing consequences for Pakistan , already fragile and vulnerable from guns , drugs , corruption , ethnic killings and religious conflict . 
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .  
Many governmental representatives also stated that it is not necessary to arrive at a universal definition of indigenous peoples in the context of the draft United Nations declaration , although some Governments recognized the concerns of countries with complex ethnic and historical circumstances .  
In order to ensure democracy and human rights for all Afghan men and women , irrespective of religious , racial , ethnic and / or linguistic differences , based upon the recognized principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other related internationally accepted covenants in line with the tenets of Islamic Law ,  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
However , it was regrettable that no reference was made to the situation of female migrant workers , who suffered multiple discrimination based on sex and national or ethnic origin and very often lacked adequate legal status in the host countries .  
It can not be overemphasized that discrimination between human beings on the grounds of race , colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples as well as the harmony of people living side by side even within the same State .  
In many instances , warfare is triggered and sustained by the manipulation of fears and animosities that may have little bearing on real or perceived grievances ; group identity along ethnic or communal lines has become the rationale for intolerance , racism , hatred and such repugnant concepts as ethnic cleansing .  
Membership in the national society was generally defined by citizenship , which should be extended liberally to all who had made the State their permanent home , without distinction on racial , ethnic , religious or linguistic grounds .  
Cases referred to included : the Hungarian minority in Slovakia , where in schools of the national minorities , history and geography was taught by ethnic Slovak teachers , which allegedly led to a distortion of historical truth and thus negatively affected future generations of Hungarians learning about their own past ( Federal Union of European Nationalities ) ; the Arab minority in Israel , where educational guidelines and policies were designed to entrench the values of the Jewish culture , and the characteristics of the identity of the Palestinian minority were suppressed .  
During the discussions particular attention was paid to the positive role of the media as an instrument for the protection and promotion of the rights of persons belonging to minorities , as well as to the negative role the media could play by exacerbating problems involving minorities and latent ethnic , religious or racial tensions .  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Civil peace and security are endangered by the combined impact of various forms of violence and conflict between ethnic , religious , linguistic and other groups , the rise of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism , of fanaticism and fundamentalism of different kinds , of terrorism and organized crime , exclusion and discrimination directed against vulnerable groups within societies , proceeding from a culture of violence and war .  
A strengthened rule of law is essential to safeguarding basic freedoms , protecting ethnic and religious minorities , promoting Government accountability and providing social stability and the legal framework necessary for economic development .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
The statute also specifies that for rape to be considered a crime against humanity , it must be a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds .  
Committed to the full development of human potential within just and inclusive societies attentive to the promotion of harmonious and equitable relations among individuals belonging to diverse ethnic and religious groups ;  
Conflict , whether at the international , State , or community level , can be considered a natural , inevitable consequence of differing interests , goals or values which may be exacerbated by ethnic , racial , cultural and linguistic differences .  
Education should enable the individual to live and work in a free society , and should promote mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
The wars in the former Yugoslavia were marked by horrendous crimes against international humanitarian law , often committed in the name of that repulsive policy , ethnic cleansing .  
The Committee expresses concern that in view of the complex ethnic and religious composition of the population of Croatia , the report does not include statistical information on the social , economic and political standing of minority women .  
That the accused intended to deprive an identifiable group of persons of life , liberty or security of person because of the target group 's political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural or religious affiliation ;  
It is now time for the international community to be more united and determined to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to find a peaceful and workable solution to calm the situation and to resolve the conflict in Kosovo .  
The key element of the crime of genocide is the specific intent on the part of the perpetrator to physically destroy , in whole or in part , a protected group , namely a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group .  
The Conference should examine the psychological , social , political and economic factors that made individuals receptive to racism , in view of forecasts concerning future ethnic and racial conflict .  
The periodic reports of the Secretary-General and of the international press provide ample graphic evidence of a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against the Turkish Cypriot people during that period .  
In addition to the more obvious manifestations , developing countries practised more subtle forms of racial discrimination through immigration laws based on ethnic and regional considerations .  
Respect for human rights and the protection of the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities constituted a firm basis for peaceful coexistence , dialogue , mutual understanding and tolerance .  
Her Government recognized and encouraged the cultural and ethnic diversity of modern Australia and had recently enacted legislation to prohibit offensive or intimidating public behaviour based on race .  
The claim that the Serbian authorities pursue an open policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing supported by brutal military and police action against innocent Albanian civilians is both untrue and ludicrous .  
In the chapeau , her delegation was in favour of the words widespread and systematic and the words on political , philosophical , racial , ethnic or religious grounds or any other arbitrarily defined grounds .  
While habitual residence constituted a very close link between a natural person and a State , there were also ethnic , linguistic , religious , cultural , social and political factors which were often very important in the case of succession of States .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
It appears that if the pattern of results of the first round is maintained , each of the main political parties will have drawn overwhelming support for the ethnic and regional base of their leaders .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
It is intolerable for fundamental principles of international humanitarian law to be violated , that minimal protection is not provided to civilians and non-combatants and that people are forcibly displaced for ethnic or religious reasons .  
The existence of many internal armed conflicts , some of them attributable to ethnic mistrust and resistance , which extend to the regional level and in which the warring parties resort to the hiring of mercenaries to boost their military potential ;  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
The reported mass killing of civilians by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds has continued since 8 August 1998 and has now found a serious and tragic dimension in Bamyan , a city largely populated by Shiite Muslims .  
Education must offer the individual the opportunity to live and work in a free society , and must foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
It is the mission of culture and science to enable individuals to live in a free society , and to foster mutual understanding , tolerance and friendship among peoples and racial , ethnic and religious groups .  
Conflicts based on ethnic , religious or cultural grounds are still emerging in many parts of our planet , claiming innocent lives and precious resources , while the race in military expenditures knows no bounds .  
The political parties bear the mark of mistrust ( they may not join any international organizations ) ; English is introduced as a national language , although unknown to non _ Tutsi ethnic groups ; the problem of the nationality of the Banyamulenge and relocated peoples remains unresolved ; and the Supreme Council of Justice is replaced by a Haute Autorit Judiciaire , headed by the President of the Republic .  
In an era when ethnic conflict and civil war have become increasingly common in comparison to international armed conflicts , the responsibility of a new Government to pay for past violations may require a specific guiding principle , which should be incorporated in the guidelines .  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
In many countries currently engulfed by war and internal conflict , adjustment-induced social unrest provided the initial impetus for ethnic , tribal , religious fundamentalist and nationalist frenzy which eventually led to armed conflict . 
The legislation gives priority to countries which have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty alleviation or have recently suffered a major natural disaster , but it excludes countries with excessive military spending , gross violations of human rights , blatant drug trafficking or ethnic conflicts ;  
Calls upon the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to revoke all discriminatory legislation and to apply all other legislation without discrimination against any ethnic , national , religious or linguistic group , to ensure the speedy and consistent investigation of acts of discrimination and violence against refugees and internally displaced persons , and to ensure the arrest and punishment of those responsible for acts of discrimination and violence ;  
Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
To respect fully all the rights of individuals in Kosovo , whatever their ethnic , cultural or religious backgrounds , so as to guarantee equitable treatment of their values and historic patrimony and so as to preserve and permit expression of their national , cultural , religious and linguistic identities in accordance with international standards and the Final Act of Helsinki of 1 August 1975 ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Such a commitment could strengthen resect for the human rights of all and promote the rights of persons belonging to national , ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , in particular , key elements for peaceful coexistence , mutual understanding and tolerance among societies and the international community .  
The Anti _ Racism Information Service suggested that the following issues could provide input into recommendations : racial discrimination in the workplace ; migration and related questions ; neo _ Nazism ; Holocaust denial ; the caste system ; inclusion of anti _ racist thought in education ; negative consequences of international trade and globalization ; the despoliation of nature and the overexploitation of natural resources ; ethnocide , ethnic cleansing and violence against women in ethnic conflict .  
Popular and / or politically driven anti-foreigner sentiment based on racial , ethnic , national or religious characteristics is a strong obstacle both to recognition of and respect for the human rights of migrants .  
The requisite intent has support in direct and indirect evidence , including Khmer Rouge statements , eyewitness accounts and the nature and number of victims in each group , both in absolute terms and in proportion to each group 's total population . 12 These groups qualify as protected groups under the Convention : the Muslim Cham as an ethnic and religious group ; the Vietnamese communities as an ethnic and , perhaps , a racial group ; and the Buddhist monkhood as a religious group . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
The intensified terror tactics and military assaults by the Yugoslav forces against the ethnic Albanian community in many parts of the province represent the continuation of a systematic repression by the Yugoslav authorities to drive innocent civilians , especially women and children , out of Kosovo , reminiscent of the policy of ethnic cleansing that was carried out during the dark days of the Bosnian crisis .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico is firmly convinced that the preferred means of settling a conflict must be dialogue and negotiation , and it therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
The Rio Group therefore calls on all parties to resume , as soon as possible , talks with a view to achieving a comprehensive and final settlement with a view to re-establishing a stable and lasting peace based on respect for the human rights of all ethnic groups and minorities in the region , and on the territorial integrity of States .  
Demands an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities which has led to further ethnic cleansing in the region , the genocide of Kosovars , their forced mass exodus and the destruction of their property with the aim of preventing their return , and also demands the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo ;  
Ever since the Greek Cypriot side 's forceful usurpation of the legitimate seat of government in 1963 , the Greek Cypriot administration has been violating the Turkish Cypriot people 's vested rights of sovereign equality , partnership and fundamental freedoms through a campaign of ethnic cleansing during 1963-1974 and thereafter maintaining an inhuman embargo in all fields . 
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
The continuing violations of the rights of children , in particular through the lack of conformity of the existing legal framework with the Convention on the Rights of the Child , through conscription of children into forced labour programmes , through their military and sexual exploitation and through discrimination against children belonging to ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
And all other parties to the hostilities in Myanmar to respect fully their obligations under international humanitarian law , including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 , to halt the use of weapons against the civilian population , to protect all civilians , including children , women and persons belonging to ethnic or religious minorities , from violations of humanitarian law and to avail themselves of services offered by impartial humanitarian bodies ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal repressive measures committed by Serbian security and paramilitary forces in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
In this context , the OIC Contact Group lends full support to the Secretary-General for his initiatives and diplomatic efforts in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons under international protection throughout Kosova . * Reissued for technical reasons .  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of the country ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite continuing efforts , contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , any form of discrimination against , inter alia , Blacks , Arabs and Muslims , xenophobia , Negrophobia , anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
In that context , it continued to be concerned about the damaging effects of armed conflict on Afghan children , who were the victims of incessant hostilities and abhorrent treatment by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds .  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
We wish to recall the declaration of the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group , held in Geneva on 7 April 1999 ; to confirm our strong condemnation of the policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the Serbian authorities against the Albanian Kosovars ; and to demand an immediate halt to all repressive actions undertaken in Kosovo by the Serbian authorities and the immediate withdrawal of the Serbian military and paramilitary forces from Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
Since the arbitrary termination of the autonomy of Kosovo by the Belgrade authorities in 1989 , we , together with the international community , have watched with great distress the Serbian acts of atrocities against the innocent and hard-working people of Kosovo and the campaigns of ethnic cleansing that have been reminiscent of the preceding sinister acts against the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina that were also committed by the Serbs .  
In Nairobi , the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by his meeting with Sudanese women of various ethnic , religious and political backgrounds who , within their respective organizations and through the implementation of different projects involving and empowering women at the grass-roots level , are making their own valuable contribution towards the common goal of peace-making and building in the Sudan .  
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
It is in this framework and with these purposes in mind that Hungary expresses its strong desire to live side by side with a democratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at peace with its ethnic communities , respectful of all human rights , including the rights of national minorities , and thus ready to rejoin the community of nations .  
Albania highly appreciates the irreplaceable role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , which stopped one of the greatest human catastrophes in Europe after the Second World War and which brought to a halt the genocide and the ethnic cleansing carried out against millions of innocent Albanian civilians in the heart of Europe , thereby protecting the best values of our world civilization .  
This political solution should be followed by specific steps towards the establishment of the structures necessary for a civilian administration , economic rebuilding and development , democratic institutions and the rule of law , as well as security and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms for all , regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
The policies of structural adjustment pursued in the 1980s probably contributed in many places to intensified tension between the different ethnic , racial or social groups in society , and may have had enormous cost in terms of lost development opportunities and may have hampered many groups in their enjoyment of the right to food . 
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
From our point of view , the crisis in the Balkans should encourage the international community to seek a better understanding of the extreme importance of joint activities , within the framework of decisions taken by United Nations bodies , towards the settlement of ethnic conflicts by peaceful means in order to maintain peace , protect human rights and provide an opportunity to every person for the unhampered achievement of his or her human and spiritual potential .  
The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the ability of every person to become a useful member of society , the promotion of understanding , tolerance and friendship among all nations , all racial , ethnic and religious groups are at once the origin , condition and consequence of education aimed at personal development and based on the higher interests of the person educated : 
In exercising their functions , all persons undertaking public duties or holding public office in Kosovo will be required to observe internationally recognized human rights standards , and shall not discriminate against any person on any grounds , such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , association with a national community , property , birth or other status .  
The improvement of the overall human rights situation would require the emergence of a framework for building peace through an inclusive participatory process involving continuing consultations with all segments of the Afghan people , aimed at establishing a broad _ based , multi _ ethnic and fully representative government .  
In order to build a firm foundation for real and enduring peace and security , it was essential to eliminate the root causes of conflict , be they of a political , ethnic , economic , social or other nature .  
In this context , the requests of the members of the Albanian ethnic national minority and KFOR to be granted full control over the Inland Revenue Office , the registry of immovable property , vital records books and other registry books that constitute a legal foundation for the exercise of the rights of citizens on the basis of ownership of both movable and immovable property are also unlawful .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party and further recommends that it increase measures to reduce economic and social disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The factors driving these conflicts which the Seminar identified showed why internal conflicts clearly predominate : ethnic rivalries , general decline in the rule of law , democratic shortcomings on the part of the political authorities , defective governance policies , poverty and underdevelopment , identity-based political demands , politicization of ethnicity , shortcomings in reintegrating former combatants , lack of access to agricultural land , economic difficulties and other factors .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
This does not speak only of a tolerant attitude , but also about a deliberate protection of the separatist-terrorist so-called KLA in order to shun possible responsibility for daily killings , abductions , the destruction and burning of Serbian medieval monasteries and cultural monuments - in which way KFOR becomes practically an accomplice in the great evil against the Serbian people in a flagrant massive violation of human rights and the campaign of ethnic cleansing . 
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
To help bring this issue to a just and lasting resolution , the Chinese Government offers encouragement and support to the conflicting parties in Afghanistan so that they can put the interests of their nation and country above everything else , disregard their ethnic , religious and political differences , stop fighting among themselves as soon as possible and establish a broad-based and stable government acceptable to all sides , on the basis of mutual respect and extensive consultations .  
It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Police restructuring involves reducing the number of excess police and ensuring that the rationalized police forces are representative of the ethnic composition of the community they serve and that they work within legitimate , transparent , accountable and professional organizational structures .  
Most important and this is to be welcomed it has recognized in its resolutions adopted in recent years that repression of the civilian population , ethnic cleansing , genocide , large-scale forced displacement and relocation of civilians and other flagrant violations of international humanitarian law constitute a threat to international peace and security .  
This is a professional body that is trained to focus on the protection and defence of the individual and collective rights of citizens and is sensitive to , and respectful of , ethnic , cultural and linguistic diversities . 
Considering the care that has been shown by the ruling party to grant citizenship , and thus voting rights , to the " diaspora " ( ethnic Croats who live abroad ) , the Special Rapporteur places special emphasis on the rights of all those who qualify for Croatian citizenship , irrespective of ethnicity , and especially refugees , to claim citizenship in a timely manner , thus enabling them to participate in the forthcoming Croatian elections .  
We would not be true to our consciences if we confined ourselves to tackling the illicit traffic in small arms : we need to include also arms transferred licitly to irresponsible regimes by those who know full well that they will be distributed among ethnic groups that are bent on committing inhuman activities such as ethnic cleansing .  
Additionally , the legacy of the Kosovo crisis upon the federal authorities , when the international community , led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , intervened in order to halt ethnic cleansing , has not encouraged the scheduling of formal bilateral meetings .  
Strongly deplores the serious breaches of internationally recognized rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and other persons of concern over the past year , and remains particularly preoccupied that systematic violations of human rights , blatant disregard of international humanitarian law , and policies of wholesale expulsions of populations and ethnic cleansing have caused significant displacement both internally and across borders in many regions of the world ;  
Among them are an elected Government that enjoys widespread legitimacy within the population a rare fact in the aftermath of a war ; a strong and active civil society ; a fabric of national cohesion , without significant polarization along ethnic or religious lines ; a land endowed with rich soil and considerable mineral resources ; and a tradition of higher education .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Discrimination based on race , colour , ethnic or national origin , xenophobia , religious hatred or intolerance is an increasing phenomenon in Europe and was perceived by participants as a potential source of conflict . 
These ignominious acts of terror , the glaring few in a multitude , provide abundant evidence that , despite the contrary pronouncements of the United Nations civil and security presences , the KLA has not been demilitarized and disarmed and that UNMIK and KFOR continue to countenance ethnic Albanian terrorism and systematic ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and other non-Albanians of Kosovo and Metohija .  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
The Ministers emphasize that resolute opposition to terrorists sheltering behind political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic and religious slogans is in no way aimed at discrimination against any one of those causes .  
The methodology of the report is accountable for another obfuscation : in an effort to scale down their size and significance , the human rights abuses evident in the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium , the ethnic cleansing of Serbs after the aggression and the destruction of civilian infrastructure are immediately referenced to alleged violations of human rights by the Yugoslav side .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Accordingly , in Syria , there is no basis for any discrimination , exception , restriction or preference on grounds of race , colour , descent or national or ethnic origin that would in any way hamper or impede the recognition , enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political , economic , social or cultural fields , in employment or in any other sphere of public life .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The achievement of the ambitious but realistic goals of the International Decade of the Worlds Indigenous People would not only solve specific problems faced by indigenous peoples but would also make a substantial contribution to the peaceful coexistence of nations , national minorities and ethnic groups .  
Her delegation had always stressed the need to classify ethnic groups in order to facilitate national policies on the rights of national minorities and indigenous people , and believed that the draft declaration should make a distinction between two categories of indigenous groups , those leading a tribal way of life on isolated reservations and those integrated with the rest of society .  
As a moral and pluralistic society , Indonesia was committed to promoting respect for human rights and taking into account the varied cultural , ethnic and religious composition of the nation , as provided for in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action .  
Ms . Viotti ( Brazil ) said that ethnic cleansing , the resurgence of false doctrines of racial superiority , the trend towards restricting the rights of migrant workers , the use of new technologies to spread intolerance and the abuses committed against asylum-seekers and refugees were just some of the obstacles which the international community must overcome to keep alive the spirit that had inspired the historic struggle to put an end to racism .  
Mr . Tekle ( Eritrea ) said that since Ethiopia had begun its systematic violation of the human rights of Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin , it had deported close to 70,000 of them on ethnic grounds , confined 2,000 in harsh concentration camps , was responsible for the disappearance of 1,500 more and deprived 15,000 others of both jobs and housing without allowing them to emigrate .  
Deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as acts of violence , persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,  
Considering that the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and enrich the cultural heritage of society as a whole in the States in which such persons live ,  
Urges States and the international community to promote and protect the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , as set out in the Declaration , including through the facilitation of their participation in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of society and in the economic progress and development of their country ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The effect on developing countries includes reduced economic investments , more decaying neighbourhoods and fewer government resources allotted to essential social development programmes such as education , health and programmes promoting gender and ethnic equality .  
The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
These grounds are : sex ; marital status ; religious belief ; ethical belief ; colour , race , ethnic or national origin ( which includes nationality or citizenship ) ; disability ; age ; political opinion ; employment status ; family status ; or sexual orientation .  
However , to these categories there ought to be added a fourth : man-conceived disasters , including genocide , mass deportations , the use of death camps , ethnic cleansing , enforced or involuntary disappearances and other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law .  
Help Age International specified that the basic economic , social and cultural rights , the right to development and civil and political rights , regardless of age , gender , ethnic , political and religious background and culture should be drawn together as fundamental standards .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
Although ethnic conflicts may be considered autonomous and disparate , these conflicts pose a real threat to international security and generate many forms of human rights violations which must be addressed .  
Responses to situations of such conflicts designed to reduce tensions and violence based on ethnic , racial or xenophobic conflicts may include : preventive diplomacy ; early-warning mechanisms ; mediation ; promotion of tolerance through human rights education ; support to democratic institutions through better representation of all segments of the society ; affirmative action ; promotion of multiculturalism .  
Many still wish to return to the properties they occupied prior to the war , but return has been made difficult by complicated property laws that have not been implemented and by the difficult economic , security and political realities facing those who would now be part of ethnic minorities in their pre-war communities .  
In the weeks that followed , members of ethnic minority groups , especially Roma and Serbs , began fleeing Kosovo owing to fear of the killings , kidnapping , looting of properties , evictions , widespread burning of villages , as well as cultural , historical and religious monuments , and other forms of intimidation directed against them.The situation of the Serb , Roma and other minority communities has been a painful one of widespread human rights violations . 
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
The Secretary-General raised the pertinent question of humanitarian intervention in the wake of the inaction of the Organization with regard to the genocidal war in Rwanda and its horrific consequences , and the forced intervention in Kosovo , which saved thousands of lives and reversed the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing there , but which was carried out outside the ambit of the Security Council . 
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
The norms and principles of international law are interconnected and interdependent , and they constitute an integral system designed to bar humanitarian disasters and ethnic cleansing , as well as acts of aggression .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
As we prepare to enter the twenty-first century , and cognizant of the challenges that will confront our continent and peoples , we emphasize the imperative need and a high sense of urgency to rekindle the aspirations of our peoples for stronger unity , solidarity and cohesion in a larger community of peoples transcending cultural , ideological , ethnic and national differences .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
The Committee regrets that its dialogue with representatives of the State party regarding the root causes of the armed conflict was inconclusive ; the absence in the report of statistics relating to the north and east of the country can only reinforce the view of the Committee that the question of discrimination in relation to the economic , social and cultural rights of ethnic groups remains the central issue in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka .  
If the Government of a State were to distribute letters in which an ethnic or minority group alleged that it was the victim of repressive measures or that its fundamental human rights were not recognized in the sovereign territory of another State , the Government of Cyprus reserved the right to act in the same way if that practice continued .  
To the contrary , tensions have increased in many parts of the world and have intensified human suffering because of a resurgence of the arms race with the attendant death , exodus , ethnic cleansing and famine .  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .  
In its report the Team presented the preliminary conclusion that the systematic massacre of those Rwandan Hutus ] remaining in Zaire was an abhorrent crime against humanity , but the underlying rationale for the decisions is material to whether these killings constituted genocide , that is to eliminate , in part , the Hutu ethnic group .  
The period marked increased collaboration between ICMC and several Council agencies , particularly those that extended funding for its actions in favour of persons uprooted or forced into flight because of war and conflict , racial or ethnic persecution , human rights violations , and environmental degradation.The ICMC programmes supported by Council agencies included : 
It was convinced that the members of the Committee would , as in previous years , support in large numbers the current years resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo , as a message that genocide and ethnic cleansing were unacceptable and as a sign of solidarity with the Albanian people .  
Anyone who , either orally , through the medium of the press or any document or representation , or by any other means , publicly expresses ideas that are offensive to any individual or group of individuals by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 500 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
Anyone whose profession consists in supplying goods or services who refuses to serve an individual solely by reason of their racial or ethnic origin or their religion , or who sets conditions relating to racial or ethnic origin or religion , shall be guilty of a criminal offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a maximum fine of 400 Cyprus pounds , or both .  
The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
In a climate of ethnic intolerance and total disrespect for international law , UNPROFOR earlier and the High Representative later ensured that fair , objective , tolerant radio and television as well as newspapers received adequate international support , while broadcasting licences for other stations were withdrawn , and the Stabilization Force ( SFOR ) took control of transmitters when necessary .  
Mr . AL-BUSAIDY ( Oman ) said that he looked forward to the establishment of an international criminal court which would help to put an end to bloodshed and prosecute those responsible for such heinous crimes as ethnic cleansing , aggression , genocide , torture and the forcible transfer of defenceless civilians .  
The argument for including reference to these disasters in the definition is based on cases where Governments respond to such disasters by discriminating against or neglecting certain groups on political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds or by violating the human rights of the affected population in other ways , thereby creating special protection needs .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Apartheid was introduced in 1948 by the National Party as a system of racial segregation designed to maintain a situation of inequality between the Whites and the other ethnic and racial groups living in South Africa , in the economic , social , political and cultural spheres .  
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
Development is unsustainable where the rule of law and equity do not exist ; where ethnic , religious or sexual discrimination are rampant ; where there are restrictions on free speech , free association and the media ; or where large numbers of people live in abject and degrading poverty .  
Too often , nationalism has been used to advance a racist , discriminatory , and persecutory policy that scapegoats ethnic , religious , and political groups as a false pretext for the existence of national problems .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
In turn , directing international assistance to support decentralized and locally owned activities on behalf of all affected parties can help in regenerating war-torn communities and in promoting national reconciliation by inducing beneficiaries from different ethnic groups to work together towards a common future .  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
Mr . Oron ( Israel ) , speaking on agenda item 114 , said that , although hybrid ethnic and national identities had become part of the social landscape , they had not yet become the rule and were all too often accompanied by overt manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .  
The new text stated not only that discrimination on grounds of race , age , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national , ethnic or social origin , sexual orientation , disability or state of health was prohibited , but also that the State would grant special protection to persons who were at a disadvantage for any of those reasons and would punish those responsible for violations committed against such persons .  
Such personal networks hide behind consensual agreements , justified by political , social , ethnic and religious arguments , so that it is difficult for the public to become aware of them .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
The safe , voluntary and dignified return of refugees and displaced persons is essential to reverse the consequences of ethnic cleansing and to heal , as far as possible , the deep and festering wounds that it caused during the long years of war .  
We need societies where every single individual regardless of social status , gender , disability or ethnic or religious background is empowered to influence his or her living conditions for a better future .  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .  
That the Government introduce political endeavour and supporting resources to address the systemic barriers and social attitudes standing in the way of the realization of human rights by the ethnic and religious minorities ;  
Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3 [ of art .  7 ] , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law ;  
Discrimination based on racial , social , ethnic , economic , and even geographical and language considerations , is not only very palpable in the attitudes of the ordinary people in the streets , it is also very clearly present in government policies .  
In some parts of the world , ethnic , religious and political conflicts had led to the systematic violation of human rights , blatant disregard for humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing .  
Thus , the recognition that UNMIK has been incompetent ( or unwilling ) to halt the final stages of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Metohija and to establish civil administration is revealed in all its devastating brutality .  
On the other hand , mountainous countries and regions are populated by numerous ethnic groups and peoples whose traditional socioeconomic lifestyle enables them to adapt to and organize their vital activities in harsh living conditions .  
Terms like ethnic minority , ethnic conflict , immigration restrictions , new immigrant , illegal alien , urban poor and colourblindness , are used to deny or obscure the racist aspects of certain social behaviours or government policies .  
All individuals , regardless of ethnicity or official rank or capacity , directly involved in the practice of socalled ethnic cleansing or other serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law should appear before a competent court and be judged .  
This requires sustained educational and proactive initiatives in those various sectors at the community level which are geared towards promoting harmonious social relations between different ethnic groups .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
Often driven by political ambition or greed , these wars have preyed on ethnic and religious differences , they are often sustained by external economic interests , and they are fed by a hyperactive and in large part illicit global arms market .  
The old world order has been replaced by new local conflicts in which political and economic factors cut across historical , religious , ethnic or nationalistic lines .  
The episodes of ethnic cleansing committed throughout the history of humanity were intended to harm both the racial , religious and cultural identity of a group or people , at times its very physical existence .  
The relevant indicators used to assess such an adequate standard of living , and its incidence among the child population , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , social and ethnic origin , and family situation ;  
To make such forms available and accessible to every child , providing inter alia any relevant disaggregated data including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , national , social and ethnic origin , coverage and budgetary allocation ;  
To introduce free secondary education and offer financial assistance in case of need , indicating the children concerned , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , and national , social and ethnic origin , and the budget allocated for that purpose ;  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .  
Although moderate forces were successful in the municipal elections held in April in Bosnia and Herzegovina , the nationalist parties continue to dominate the political life of the country , which remains divided along ethnic lines .  
The States concerned reaffirmed that terrorist acts were in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
Democracy in Kosovo must begin to take root , but given Kosovos troubled history , institutionalizing the sharing of administrative and political responsibility between the ethnic communities concerned will not be quick or easy .  
Our view is that they are in fact arcane and immoral , with the leadership of both institutions confined to a royal family of select individuals who must meet the criterion of regional indeed ethnic origin . 
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The Statute defines the forcible transfer of the children of a threatened national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another group as genocide , while rape and sexual slavery are classified as both war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
He said India , which had over a-billion inhabitants and constituted a real ethnic , linguistic and religious patchwork , had chosen an economic , social and political model which was unique for a former colony with development problems .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
It is not an ethnic , tribal or religious conflict , but one born of greed and the desire by a handful of unpatriotic elements to control the strategic mineral and natural resources of the country .  
Such targeting was based on political , racial , national , ethnic , cultural , religious , gender as defined in article 7 , paragraph 3 , of the Statute , or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law .  
The refugee issue was not new , but it was compounded by the complexity of the situation in the countries and regions involved , with communities often divided by religious and ethnic hatreds , governance and public security lacking , and poverty widespread .  
The history of our countries in the decade just past has been marked by a plethora of bloody national and civil conflicts and an unprecedented intensification of ethnic , political and social enmity , xenophobia and alienation .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
Mr . Bazel ( Afghanistan ) : Over the years , we have heard of Taliban barbarism against living beings , such as acts of summary execution ; ethnic cleansing ; gender apartheid ; the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of innocent people ; the separation of women from their menfolk ; the torching and levelling of houses ; and the destruction of irrigation systems , canals , orchards and means of subsistence , systematically carried out by the Pakistan-Taliban-bin Laden triangle in the occupied parts of Afghanistan .  
Additionally , the triangle has embarked on a policy of social engineering with the aim of changing the demographic composition of various provinces of Afghanistan through the relocation and dislocation of the native inhabitants of central and northern parts of Afghanistan in order to disturb the harmonious fraternal coexistence of Afghan ethnic groups , which has endured for hundreds of years .  
The proximate cause of conflict may be an outbreak of public disorder or a protest over a particular incident , but the root causes are more likely to be found in socio-economic inequities , systematic ethnic discrimination , denial of human rights , disputes over political participation or longstanding grievances over the allocation of land , water and other resources .  
In our view , the seeds of civil strife can invariably be found in places where Governments lack legitimacy , where governance is weak or unrepresentative , where irrational values such as fundamentalism , racism , tribalism , ethnic discrimination , social injustice , and violation of human rights are practised officially or unofficially .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
We pay tribute to the efforts of Djibouti and its President for their tireless efforts leading to the convening of the Somalia National Peace Conference in Arta , where , for the first time , a sound and correct foundation was laid for achieving consensus among 5,000 Somalis representing all social , religious , ethnic and regional factions throughout Somalia .  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
Combating terrorism was one of the priorities for the member States of the group of Azerbaijan , Georgia , Republic of Moldova , Ukraine and Uzbekistan , as indicated in the statement of 24 April 1999 , contained in document A / 54 / 94 , in which the Presidents of those States had expressed their concern at the increased number of acts of terrorism , recognized the necessity to combat terrorism in all its manifestations and decided to spare no effort in the fight against ethnic intolerance , separatism , religious extremism and terrorism . 
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
In the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups for instance indigenous people , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with HIV / AIDS .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
Also welcoming the plan put forward by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve peacefully the crisis in certain municipalities in southern Serbia , and expressing encouragement for the implementation of political and economic reforms designed to reintegrate the ethnic Albanian population as full members of civil society ,  
The Committee is also concerned that the State party has not taken measures to address discrimination against children who are born out of wedlock , those affected by HIV / AIDS , children in remote rural areas , children born of incestuous relationships , institutionalized children , pregnant girls , children with disabilities , street children and children of ethnic minority groups .  
Particular attention should be paid by the discussions under both sub-themes to the position and special vulnerability of children who have been marginalized or discriminated against on the basis of their ethnic origin of economic status who can be , for example , singled out in schools for bullying or degrading treatment by teachers or be more vulnerable to violence within the family that escapes detection by the normal monitoring systems ( for example for families that are homeless or illegal migrants ) .  
We voice our satisfaction in this regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina has acquired an elected Council of Ministers , whose main objective is to undertake basic reforms on all levels , particularly by advancing the noble values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among all the ethnic groups .  
In doing so , I recalled the expectations of the international community for rapid progress by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian Governments on the implementation of the political , economic and social confidence-building measures set out in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbian plan for the region , independent of other progress in negotiations with the ethnic Albanian representatives .

A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
It implies a commitment to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , particularly the rights of groups that are disadvantaged or victims of discrimination and persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and cultural minorities to have free access to the expression of their own culture and that of others .  
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .

In particular , he identified three areas of ongoing concern : the human rights situation and physical protection of ethnic minority communities in Kosovo ; the quality of the rule of law , including the independence of the judiciary ; and the extent to which human rights standards are reflected and integrated into the policies and practices of UNMIK and KFOR . 
Beyond complying with the Tribunal , the Framework Agreement places responsibility on the domestic authorities to undertake crucial measures , including the prosecution , dismissal or transfer , as appropriate , of persons in military , paramilitary and police forces and other public servants , responsible for serious violations of the basic rights of persons belonging to ethnic or minority groups . 2 It is essential to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina that an adequate legal framework to effect such duties be established .

The situation of military detentions by KFOR is based on rather more obscure legal grounds . 9 The Special Representative is informed that KFOR routinely arrests and detains individuals on an extrajudicial basis , mostly ethnic Albanians suspected of fighting in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia , citing resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) , the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and customary international law as the legal sources of KFOR authority for detentions .

Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;
