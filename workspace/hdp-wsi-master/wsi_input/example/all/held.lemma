Not so long ago , R . O . C . business-men were involved in the killing of seals in South Africa , which was followed by the rhino horn incident and the reckless killing of the black-faced spoonbill . These incidents have challenged the humane philosophy Chinese have traditionally held dear .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Thus in the spring they turned the soil and planted seeds ; when the summer rainy season came , that was the time to allow the little creatures of the wild to be born and mature , and anyway it being dangerous to go deep into the mountains in the rainy season , people held off on hunting .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners . Tuo tea , a variety of Pu'er whose cakes are shaped like bowls , won gold medals two years running in contests held in Spain and Germany .  
Fresh Pu'er tea is held by the Han people to be " bitter and cold . " Nonetheless , the minorities , with their sturdy physiques , usually just roast the leaves slightly , steep the tea and partake . Because of this , people who search the mountainous areas of Yunnan for genuine aged Pu'er are often greatly disappointed .  
While researching the article , we came across many moving stories . A couple who , after being " pronounced " infertile , had gone through the long and difficult process of treatment , held each other and wept when the wife finally became pregnant ; a mother who after enduring the pain of the procedures involved gave birth to a baby with a congenital heart defect was neither bitter nor regretful , but full of since re gratitude . . . .  
My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association .

In the past , prehistoric civilization " . . . generally revolved around Lungshan and Yangshao , " says Wang Mingda , research assistant at the Archaeological Institute of Zhejiang Province . Most people believe that the origin and center of civilization was in North China . After the excavation of huge numbers of artifacts of the Liangzhu , it was established that the Yangtze river valley , like the Yellow river valley , also held " a very glorious and splendid culture . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
The main ceremonies of the Ami people are the " Sea Festival " held each June and the " Harvest Festival " each July and August . Travelling to the east in January as we did for this article , we missed the opportunity to attend those . But , since a local election is fast approaching , we ran into plenty of county assembly and mayoral hopefuls out trying to build up their name recognition by holding dinners in tents by the side of the road .  
A splendid photo opThe most plentiful species was the Japanese White-eye ; between 20 and 30 of them played in the tree . They self-assuredly pecked fruit , heads held high or dipped low , not even frightened away by the sound of a car door opening and closing under the tree or the rumble of an engine .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) .

The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
Now our ' Little Cutey ' is afraid that the audience seated in the rear wo n't get a clear view , so she is coming down from the stage to meet everybody . Please , everyone , look but do n't touch . " When the hostess finished her speech , " Little Cutey " walked down the stage , her hand held in that of a handsome male volunteer , and circled the audience one time .

As these five ports were all close to the teagrowing areas of southern China , the supply of tea became abundant and uninterrupted , and after the Treaty of Nanking the huge stocks of tea held in London 's warehouses expanded so much as to become a worrisome burden .  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
He once carried out a rather funny " group therapy , " for which he filled a large bucket with electrical conductors like glass , water , and magnetized iron . Amid them he erected an iron bar , upon which was tied a needle . He then pulled out a lot of wire and guided the magnetic flux to the sick areas of his patients ' bodies . The patients held onto the wire while sitting in a circle around the bucket .  
" Moon Children " was originally selected as material for a show to be aired over public television . But this " magnum opus " of more than 70 episodes laboriously filmed over two years was held up by administrative procedures at public television , which wanted to air it reduced to 44 minutes , in two segments .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers .

The Huayu Foundation has held seven classics courses for children . Every time the kids come to class , they must first put on dark blue robes and bow in front of a statue of the great sage Confucius . Then , while sitting cross-legged at low tables , the class recites fluently in loud and clear voices from the works of the Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai , " I set myself to understand the ways of Heaven and Earth , and to bring peace and stability to the people .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
The Chinese dance tradition is broad and deep . In the Zhou dynasty , the government established official forms of music and dance , and viewed them as an integral part of education . In the Han , the court held ritual performances , and at banquets guest and host would take turns leading in dances .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue . But there was innovation in form . Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , who held tremendous power , assembled some of the greatest operatic talents in the country to figure out how to turn the traditional forms of Peking opera into something that would work for modern people .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival .

In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns .

Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors . The collective photo which all the leaders lined up for is permeated by the style and passion of Southeast Asia . It makes a strong impression on anyone who sees it , wherever they may be from .  
Suddenly , it seemed , all the previous procedural problems-such as the fact that the petroleum industry law has not yet been implemented , or the amended power industry law is still held up in the Legislative Yuan-had been wished away overnight ! The privatization process is still very uncertain . Indeed , the very term itself is often misunderstood , and used in a simplistic or distorted way .  
Aiming to reach a new segment of society , HEPP has held its promotional activities in places crowded with the fashionable and cultured elite of Taipei-such as department stores , the Eslite bookstore group ( a key cultural barometer for Taipei ) , and Crown Art Center .  
Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly .

In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
When the rhododendrons began flowering in March , the annual round of recruitment fairs got under way on campuses all over Taiwan . Graduates of National Taiwan Normal University ( NTNU ) always used to have an " iron rice bowl " - a guarantee of a job in teaching . But since the Ministry of Education relaxed entrance requirements for the teaching profession , they too have faced the same problem that " graduation equals unemployment , " and for the first time ever a recruitment fair has been held on the NTNU campus .  
When someone has exhausted all avenues of appeal in the heavenly bureaucracy , the god which steps in fortuitously to save the day is one with an immortal facet to its character . These are the gods to which people turn for help . They make trouble for authority . Unlike the god Chenghuang , who must stay put at Chenghuang Temple , where his actions are held in check by a multi-tiered celestial bureaucracy , Lu Dongbin is often discovered wandering far away from the shrine in southeast Taipei that is devoted to his worship .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .

Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 .

The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
In the end Frank Hsieh won by a tiny margin of just over 4,000 votes . Political observer and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Chen Mau-hsiung has argued that Wu Den-yih originally held the upper hand in the election , but lost women 's votes as a result of the tape-recording affair . In contrast , the later video merely compounded the dissatisfaction of the electorate , contributing to the DPP gaining control in southern Taiwan .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
The bronze statue has sharp facial features-bushy eyebrows , big eyes that glare at the viewer , an aquiline nose , and a tightly closed mouth that reaches very nearly from ear to ear . The facial muscles are tensed , the expression is solemn , and both arms are held out in a circle , as if performing some kind of sacred rite .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
From the traditional Taiwanese perspective , medicine is the most elevated of professions , and many important Taiwanese families have pursued careers in this field . In the past , the medical community , the native Taiwanese elite and the opposition were held to be nearly synonymous . Now , this association has been shattered by Chang Chau-hsiung . It is no wonder that some in the DPP have described him as a " traitor . "  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character .

With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
This year , on the seventh day of that month , one tour bus after another wound up a twisting mountain road , bound for a gathering at the True Buddha School 's Vijaya Temple in Tsaotun , Nantou County .

Though held late at night , it attracted thousands of devotees . Dressed in blue robes , they chanted the sect 's sutras with deep concentration .  
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s . Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet . The success of Wu Bai &amp; China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China .

Since the middle of this year , Citibank ( acting through Debenham Tie Leung , a property management firm based in Hong Kong ) has held a series of auctions in Taipei and Kao-hsiung to sell properties from defaulted mortgages at steep discounts .

Although the seminar was held in early November , the weather in Kinmen was still warm and sunny , with a sky so blue you could practically reach up and squeeze the water out of it . Scattered here and there amidst newly constructed five-story apartment blocks were traditional southern Fujian-style homes , with their rounded roof ridges and flying eaves . If it were n't for the camouflaged bunkers scattered all over the island , one might well have forgotten that the area once reeked of gunpowder and was stationed with 100,000 troops .  
Chang Chi-luan , whom the historian Wu Hsiang-hsiang referred to as " the model Chinese newspaper man , " always held onto the spirit of a traditional Chinese man of letters . When he put out the Takungpao , he proclaimed his famous " four ' nevers ' " : " Never serve any political faction , never sell out , never be selfish , and never become blind to the truth . " Strengthening the character of Chinese newspapermen , he created a model of journalistic ethics .  
With regard to copyrighted imports such as newspapers , magazines , recordings and books , Chao explains that everything that has research value ( whether the copyright is held by an individual or an organization ) can be imported .

But news-oriented newspapers and magazines from the mainland can not be published or sold here .  
But as she joined in a brief preliminary sacred dance , she opened her eyes and found herself , one hand raised in the air , the other held below , spinning like a child . She suddenly discovered that it was as if the spinning part were merely the exterior , while she herself was as calm as the eye of a storm . Later , she immersed herself in the quarter-hour whirling , and not only did not feel faint , but actually experienced greater clarity than usual .  
However , in contrast to the relative independence of European and American think tanks , in Taiwan , where political power has always held the upper hand over pure academic research , think tanks operate with such obvious political orientations that outsiders naturally assume that think tanks are nothing but parrots reflecting the views of the powers-that-be .  
In fact , Taiwan Advocates was established in response to President Chen 's idea of a trans-party " national security alliance , " bringing together many political figures as well as social and academic elites . Taiwan Advocates aims to be " the brains of the national security alliance , " and also to link together different political forces in the Legislative Yuan . Taiwan Advocates has held few public activities , so its actual impact remains to be seen .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
Because of Yu 's clear status as a " friendly critic " of the government , the ruling party always treated Yu with great respect . Yu long held a seat on the KMT 's Central Standing Committee .

However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
An impressive parade with over 100 vehicles wound through the streets and alleys of Wanhua while temple staff in cars sprinkled cleansing holy water to expel SARS .

the meeting of heads of State of the subregion held in Addis Ababa in 1992 with a view to seeking a lasting solution to that human tragedy , it had been recognized that the only way of finally resolving the problem was not simply through achieving a peaceful solution of conflicts but also , and above all , through improving the economic situation of the countries concerned . 
that , as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , [ 25 ] / held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration , and that remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind ,  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 , of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations , and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
With the aim of laying the groundwork for a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development , several international meetings , starting with the Summit held in Miami in 1994 , have expressed support for the decision to hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra , scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year .  
While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
We would therefore be deeply appreciative if this understanding were translated into tangible results and if the subsequent technical discussions held following political consultations were much more fruitful .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
Three months before general elections are to be held , the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice , keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Although 1996 began on a promising note with the peaceful and democratic general elections held in Palestine on 20 January , a series of devastating terrorist attacks against Israel in late February and early March quickly enveloped the spirit of optimism surrounding the peace process in a sombre and cynical cloud .  
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan . 
We would like to emphasize , however in accordance with statements made by the Heads of State and Government of the Ibero-American Conference recently held in Chile that it is our position that the problems of that region must be solved in accordance with the constructive spirit of the agreements concluded between the parties involved , while protecting the legitimate rights of all the inhabitants and guaranteeing access to holy places , in full respect of international law .  
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
His treatment of the subject of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ( SSOD IV ) integrated well the range of positions held by delegations , further spelt out in thoughtful papers put forward by delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the European Union , and by New Zealand .  
Convinced that democracy was a prerequisite for respect for human dignity and socio-economic development , the Sudan had held popular congresses at the national , regional , provincial and local levels .  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
The Republic of Tajikistan has consistently adhered to the policy of settling the inter-Tajik conflict through exclusively peaceful , political means and , in fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of all citizens of Tajikistan for a comprehensive peace and calm in the country , is taking an active position at the inter-Tajik talks being held in Ashkhabad and is putting forward new and constructive proposals . 
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
Notes that communal elections are due to be held in 1996 or early 1997 and National Assembly elections in 1998 , and urges the Government of Cambodia to promote and uphold the effective functioning of multi-party democracy , including the right to form political parties , stand for election , take part freely in a representative government and to freedom of expression , in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 of annex 5 to the Agreement signed in Paris on 23 October 1991 ;

The Council recalls the resolutions adopted by Arab Summit Conferences , particularly the most recent Conference held in Cairo , which reaffirmed the commitment to a just , comprehensive and lasting peace , based on legitimate international resolutions and the principle of land for peace , in view of the fact that peace is a strategic choice for the Arab community of nations .  
Among the positive developments during the past month are a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations ; a further reduction in hostile propaganda ; the release of additional prisoners registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ( while the Government has freed all 353 such prisoners held by it , UNITA has so far released 139 ) ; the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions ; and continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 out of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
Welcoming the results of the first Round-Table Conference of Donors , held at Brussels from 25 to 27 September 1995 , conducted in a spirit of reconciliation and intended to mobilize funds for the Community Rehabilitation and National Reconciliation Programme , and aware of the important role to be played by the international community in assisting Angola in rehabilitating its economy and its basic and social infrastructures , as well as the development of human resources ,  
In seeking a common standard of achievement for all people and all countries in the area of human rights , the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , called upon all nations , regions and the international community to create favourable conditions for and effective enjoyment of basic human rights .  
Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
During its fourth world conference on crime prevention and criminal justice , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation decided , inter alia , to establish a working group with the aim of studying the issues of extradition and mutual legal assistance in Asia and the Pacific , taking into account other experiences at the regional and international levels .  
Concerning cooperation in activities directed against organized crime , particularly crime related to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the Commission requested Member States to implement the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime , [ 1 ] adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime held at Naples , Italy , from 21 to 23 November 1994 , and subsequently approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 159 of 23 December 1994 .  
As a result of discussions held at the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts on Public Administration and Finance , organized by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , in New York , in August 1995 , it was recommended that consideration should be given to establishing training programmes addressed to the most senior levels of the civil service at national , subregional or regional levels to improve the capacity of government to deal with emerging issues of civil society for the revitalization of civil services .  
25-Five sixths of the countries reported that ill or injured persons held in custody who required medical treatment were always transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
We have always held the view that the progress achieved jointly by the Israelis and the Palestinians for the peace and common prosperity of the region is undeniable proof that any regional dispute , no matter how deep-seated and complex , can eventually be solved through dialogue between the parties directly concerned .  
We note that the Permanent Representative of Lebanon , as reflected in document S / 1996 / 280 , requested that the Council convene an urgent meeting on the afternoon of Sunday , 14 April , given the grave developments in his country .  Speaking during the debate on Palestine held earlier today , the Malaysian representative referred to the worsening situation in the Middle East .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
The report also indicated that , under prevailing conditions and logistics , the earliest possible date on which elections could be held would be late February or early March 1997 , on condition that the outstanding policy issues are resolved by mid-October , failing which a further delay would be unavoidable .  
In other words , the regulation provided in article 7 is satisfactory neither to the State planning a new activity ( since it will be held liable for any harm caused even though the activity may constitute equitable and reasonable utilization ) nor to the State suffering harm from this activity ( which is entitled only to consultations if the first State has exercised due diligence ) .  
A training programme for members of human rights organizations included short seminars on human rights investigation , forensic anthropology and judicial reform , as well as a two-week intensive course on various aspects of human rights work .  Seminars for journalists were held in all Haiti 's principal towns .  
A major study on the role and status of rural women in the central and eastern European countries is instrumental in designing a plan of action to assist rural women in the transition and constituted a part of the preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 .  
Taking into account the understanding that emerged from discussions held on issues relating to programme element I . 1 during the second session of the Panel and at national , regional and international meetings after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , including the expert meetings on financial mechanisms and on the Implementation of the Forest Principles ( see para . 5 ) , the Panel may wish to consider endorsing the elements of national forest programmes discussed below as applicable to all types of forests .  
At the 1996 meeting of the group of seven major industrialized countries held in France in June , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom and the United States issued a final communiqu calling upon all States to spare no effort in securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines .  
The mission was of the view that , under prevailing conditions and constraints , the earliest possible date on which elections could be held would be late February or early March 1997 , and that holding elections during that period would depend on outstanding policy issues being resolved by mid-October , failing which a further delay would be inevitable .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
However , indicators pointing to a potential deterioration in the humanitarian situation have accumulated since early 1996 , particularly in southern Somalia , and , by the middle of the year , United Nations agencies were uncertain how much longer a renewed humanitarian crisis could be held back under prevailing conditions .  
As follow-up to the Summit , the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) planned two workshops to be held in 1996 ; the first , on managing the social consequences of structural change in transition economies ( Paris , 1 and 2 July 1996 ) , provided a forum for joint reflection and exchange of experiences between experts and senior officials in charge of economic and social policies in both transition and developed market economies .  
ESCAP has prepared and disseminated a publication on enhancing the role of non-governmental organizations in implementing the regional Agenda for Action ; convened a regional workshop on guidelines for implementing the Agenda ; held an expert group meeting on the enhancement of social security for the poor ; and a meeting of senior officials on a policy framework for lifelong preparation for old age .  
The International Council on Social Welfare , made up of a wide range of local , national and international organizations with special interests on issues related to social welfare and social development , adopted Summit follow-up as its top priority and held regional follow-up seminars for non-governmental organizations in Africa , Asia Pacific , Latin America and Europe .  
Towards that end , they resolved seriously to consider fresh policy options in order to give proper effect to the segments of the Final Declaration of the Fourth Conference , held at Pyongyang , dealing with South-South cooperation as a key element in increasing information capabilities at the national , regional and global levels .  
Accordingly , we not only commit our own efforts but also call on international , hemispheric and regional intergovernmental organizations to participate actively in organizing and following up the tasks to ensure that the summit on sustainable development to be held in Bolivia on 7 and 8 December 1996 is a historic occasion , laying the foundations of a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development that will be the core of national and international actions geared to meeting economic , social and environmental objectives .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
In view of the sharp exacerbation of the crisis in Afghanistan , a meeting of the Security Council must be held immediately with the participation of the countries concerned for the purpose of drawing up urgent measures to halt the bloodshed , bring about a political settlement of the conflict and extend assistance to the civilian population and the numerous refugees .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
As indicated in Declaration No . 1 / 488 , SLORC set itself four objectives : first , the re-establishment of peace and tranquillity in the country ; second , the restoration and provision of communication and transport ; third , measures to ensure better supply of food , clothing and shelter by facilitating the operations of private enterprise and the cooperatives in these sectors ; and fourth , when the first three measures would have been accomplished , the holding of multi-party democratic elections to be held in a free and fair manner .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations . 
Expert seminars have been held on the effects of racism and racial discrimination on the social and economic relations between indigenous peoples and States ( Geneva , 1989 ) , on schemes of internal self-government for indigenous peoples ( Nuuk , 1991 ) , on practical experience in the realization of sustainable and environmentally sound self-development of indigenous peoples ( Santiago , 1992 ) , and on practical experiences regarding indigenous land rights and claims ( Whitehorse , 1996 ) .  
In his special report , the Commissioner-General draws attention to the critical state of UNRWA 's finances , the serious structural deficit facing the Agency , the austerity measures already taken to reduce the deficit as much as possible , the impact of the measures on the quality and level of services to Palestine refugees and the implications of the reduction of services for the stability of the area .  3 .  The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
Such conferences include the World Summit for Social Development , 10 / held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , which stated that it recognized and supported indigenous people in their pursuit of economic and social development , with full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural values .  
Third , the multilateral system should be strengthened ; in that regard , the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , to be held in Singapore , would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
With respect to dual nationals of the claimant and respondent States , the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has held that international law requires that the individual be a dominant and effective national of the claimant State .  
The Special Rapporteur informed the Commission that he had received allegations concerning secret trials , allegedly held before the Special Military Court in Lagos , of a group of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at which was discovered in March 1995 .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , in his report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) cited information that had been brought to his attention in 1995 concerning the secret trials held before the Special Military Court in Lagos of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an alleged attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at .  
Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .

It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
Second , the so-called parliamentary elections held in May 1996 in Kashmir had been neither free nor fair , but had been conducted by the Indian army under extreme coercion in contravention of the existing Security Council resolutions , as extensively reported in the international media .  
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .

Although the focus of the proposed programme on the three major themes of regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , and poverty alleviation , is welcomed , there may be a need to sharpen the subprogramme elements further to better reflect desired activities in conformity with relevant legislative mandates , including the recently held United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) .

The report reviewed national experience in promoting the contribution of cooperatives to social development in forms compatible with the principles and objectives of the major international conferences held since 1990 , and focused on the need for Governments to keep under review the legislative and administrative framework governing the functioning of cooperative-type arrangements in various sectors .  
He reiterated the principles relevant to peacekeeping which had been adopted at the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries , held in Cartagena in 1995 , to the effect that peacekeeping operations should strictly adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , particularly the principles of respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs , and should be based on the consent of the parties concerned and the principle of impartiality .

These expressions of concern notwithstanding , an active electoral campaign was conducted by all major political parties , including those that had boycotted the second round of parliamentary elections held two years ago .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
The question is limited to a small number of individual and isolated cases in which the offenders are held accountable and punished , in case the investigation and the judicial verdict prove it , in the light of the State 's desire to ensure the enforcement of the law while showing no indulgence towards offenders of the crime of torture , as reflected in the detailed replies of the Egyptian authorities to the Committee .

At the World Food Summit recently held in Rome , which it would have been more appropriate to call the " World Hunger Summit " , the rich countries had harped shamelessly on human rights , while destroying food surpluses in order to keep prices high , despite the fact that satisfying one 's hunger was a fundamental human right and that the starvation of millions was the most flagrant , massive and systematic violation of the right to life .  
The overwhelming peaceful demands of the Kashmiris for self-determination in the disputed territory , which had never been a part of India , were not a matter of religious extremism , terrorism or secession , as India maintained , but could be satisfied only by the holding of the plebiscite advocated by the international community , for which the universally denounced sham elections recently held by India were no substitute .

It further states that " the will of the people shall be the basis of authority of government " , and that " this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures " . 7 It also declares the right to equality before the law , to freedom of opinion and expression , and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association .

The Israeli Government decision to establish new Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem runs counter to the spirit of peace that now prevails in the region , and constitutes an additional obstacle to the creation of a climate of understanding , reconciliation and religious tolerance in that age-old holy city held so dear by the world 's three great monotheistic religions .

Given the high level of technical sophistication that might be expected from certification authorities and the high level of trust they were intended to generate , certification authorities should , in normal circumstances , be held liable whenever the issuance of faulty certificates resulted in damages .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
A different approach was suggested , based on the discussion of the issue of liability of certification authorities , in the context of which it had been understood that , in the event of erroneous identification of a person or erroneous attribution of a public key to a person , the certification authority would be held liable for the loss sustained by any injured party unless the certification authority could demonstrate that it had exerted its best efforts to avoid the error ( see above , para .  58 ) .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs .

For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .

Attempts by the authorities to check the existence of these sacred sites have so far proved ineffective as a result of the shortcomings and loopholes in the laws governing the case , because some of the information held by a restricted number of women is secret and also because the information which is available can only be given to other women , which would imply that the rapporteur of the commissions of inquiry and the Minister responsible for Aboriginals to whom the report is to be submitted should be women .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .

In the late 1970 ' s the local film scene acquired a new look . The Motion Picture Development Foundation film library , founded in 1978 with the support of the Government Information Office , began to systematically introduce famous European films and top-notch local works to its members . And starting in 1980 , an international film festival has been held every year in conjunction with the Golden Horse Awards to show foreign art films ( together with some high-standard commercial films ) nominated for the awards .  
Because this meeting is to be held in Peking , the government had to carefully weigh the valued ties to the organization and the possible reactions of the public and academic community against the policy of no official contacts with Peking . Lien explains that " official contacts " are not thinkable , but that it was easier to allow the delegates to attend in a private capacity . However , " it is hard to say " if this is a precedent .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar . Specialists and scholars who had neither a hand in making up the bills nor were already opposed were asked to discuss these bills from a relatively fair , objective angle , in the hopes of raising public awareness and contributing toward a consensus .  
For us " China fever " raises a number of interesting questions . From the land of marvels described by Marco Polo , through the utopia pictured by philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Sick Man of Asia coveted by imperialists , to the future world power predicted by Arnold Toynbee , just what attitudes have Westerners held toward this ancient country isolated by oceans on one side and forbidding plains on the other ? And why ? The Western Powers removed many cultural treasures from the country during the course of the nineteenth century .  
Each of them now has round eyes , a bulbous nose , a curly mane , a brass bell or a basket hanging over its chest , and a pearl or a colorful sash with copper money held in its mouth . It looks like nothing so much as an overgrown Pekinese , fawning and wagging its tail . In the lion dances held every Chinese New Year 's , the lion looks as happy as the people .  
Once public consciousness has been raised to a new level , then hand-in-hand , with heads held high and chests thrust forward , all the citizens of China can join in the march to the future . Before making his oral report on administration to the Executive Yuan , premier Lee Huan instructed the Government Information Office to edit a report entitled " So Proudly We Hail ! Salute to the 21st Century " . A copy of the report was given to each legislator at the time of the administrative report . .  
Community cultural activities will be held regularly during weekends or vacations . A spirit of good neighborliness is sure to prevail , and mutual assistance within an interdependent entity will become common . In collaboration with religious and civic bodies , the government will endeavor to foster and encourage ethical norms which are in conformity with our present-day society , itself a product of popular customs and mores blended with traditional rites and ceremonies .  
One type of entertainment we discovered back then - - which had both aural and visual appeal - - was watching the quilt man fluff up the cotton for the inside of quilts . Tbe big quilt-beating bow suspended from his back and the wooden mallet he held in his hand made a low , reverberating noise that at times rang out sharp and clear . The sound had a natural rise and fall to it , a complex yet orderly melody that was quite pleasant to hear .  
For the type of woman who is keen on studying , has a high level of education and may have held a demanding job prior to marriage , the unchallenging and stultifying nature of humdrum voluntary work holds little appeal . She might prefer to go in for a more intellectual type of voluntary work .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
After World War , Japan was a defeated nation , production stopped , people were poor ; but despite the defeat , occupation , and collapse of the economy , because the bureaucratic system held firm , the government could act smoothly according to established laws and maintain social order and economic production , enabling the nation to quickly recover .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
Although political considerations have held them back from making any aggressive move so far , from a purely military perspective our success during the 1958 Kinmen bombardment in downing 31 MiGs against one plane lost and gaining air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait , together with our subsequent vigilant posture , have actually made them weigh the cost of attacking Taiwan by force , " is how assemblyman Ting Shou-chung of the Legislative Yuan 's defense committee sees it . "  
The Chinese first learned of the lion during the Han dynasty , when the Silk Route opened a westward link , and people soon held the unknown animal in awe . It was described in the following terms : " A bronze head , an iron brow and a stare like lightning . It travels 500 li in a day . Its roar scatters all beasts and makes horses piss blood . "  
In the first year after it was founded , the Yangshan foundation held lectures and workshops on aboriginal culture , and on the theory and practice of field research . It set up a biennial prize of NT $ 200,000 for persons who have made outstanding contributions to Ilan politically , environmentally , culturally or otherwise , and it offered grants to master 's and doctoral candidates using Ilan as the subject of their dissertations . "  
It 's not like a lot of magazines that just skim over things superficially and after you 're done you ca n't remember a word you 've read . That two seasoned reporters spent three hours of their time interviewing for an article of something over l , 000 words with two photographs shows admirable dedication . Competition overseas must be intense , and it 's not easy for a magazine to be held in esteem both at home and abroad .  
The Center held to this central concept throughout the process of finding and selecting a site , deciding on New York , laying out a budget , starting construction and finallyreparing the interior . " It was an incredibly complex , painstaking task that is actually of little interest to anyone who was n't directly involved , " as Director of the New York News and Culture Center Chang Min-chih puts it .  
The 2:1 exchange rate of the Belize dollar to the U . S . dollar has held steady for many years , and inflation has been kept firmly under control - - a big relief when you consider the astronomical inflation and plummeting exchange rates of its neighbors . Immigrants from Taiwan also find it reassuring that Belize and the R . O . C . have diplomatic relations and that the economic assistance we are providing them has made us well liked by the government and public alike . "  
The " Mei Stream Arts Society , " organized by twelve local Puli painters including Liang Kun-ming and I-yong Hung , has continually held individual and group exhibitions since being established fifteen years ago , and has earned quite a fine reputation in the arts community .  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
Not so long ago , R . O . C . business-men were involved in the killing of seals in South Africa , which was followed by the rhino horn incident and the reckless killing of the black-faced spoonbill . These incidents have challenged the humane philosophy Chinese have traditionally held dear .  
Two months ago a Canadian artist , J . Fenwick Lansdowne , held an exhibition in Taiwan on the theme of Chinese rare birds . His lively and fine depictions of Chinese birds and their habitats has led many people , including some ecologists , to exclaim : " The Chinese have not been good at giving realistic renderings of birds and their habitats , which is something they should strive hard to do in the future . "  
Thus in the spring they turned the soil and planted seeds ; when the summer rainy season came , that was the time to allow the little creatures of the wild to be born and mature , and anyway it being dangerous to go deep into the mountains in the rainy season , people held off on hunting .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners . Tuo tea , a variety of Pu'er whose cakes are shaped like bowls , won gold medals two years running in contests held in Spain and Germany .  
Fresh Pu'er tea is held by the Han people to be " bitter and cold . " Nonetheless , the minorities , with their sturdy physiques , usually just roast the leaves slightly , steep the tea and partake . Because of this , people who search the mountainous areas of Yunnan for genuine aged Pu'er are often greatly disappointed .  
While researching the article , we came across many moving stories . A couple who , after being " pronounced " infertile , had gone through the long and difficult process of treatment , held each other and wept when the wife finally became pregnant ; a mother who after enduring the pain of the procedures involved gave birth to a baby with a congenital heart defect was neither bitter nor regretful , but full of since re gratitude . . . .  
My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association . He thinks this must be an opinion held by some ROC citizens as a result of their own shortcomings - - their lack of poise or inability to communicate with foreign customs officers .  
In the past , prehistoric civilization " . . . generally revolved around Lungshan and Yangshao , " says Wang Mingda , research assistant at the Archaeological Institute of Zhejiang Province . Most people believe that the origin and center of civilization was in North China . After the excavation of huge numbers of artifacts of the Liangzhu , it was established that the Yangtze river valley , like the Yellow river valley , also held " a very glorious and splendid culture . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
The main ceremonies of the Ami people are the " Sea Festival " held each June and the " Harvest Festival " each July and August . Travelling to the east in January as we did for this article , we missed the opportunity to attend those . But , since a local election is fast approaching , we ran into plenty of county assembly and mayoral hopefuls out trying to build up their name recognition by holding dinners in tents by the side of the road .  
A splendid photo opThe most plentiful species was the Japanese White-eye ; between 20 and 30 of them played in the tree . They self-assuredly pecked fruit , heads held high or dipped low , not even frightened away by the sound of a car door opening and closing under the tree or the rumble of an engine .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
Now our ' Little Cutey ' is afraid that the audience seated in the rear wo n't get a clear view , so she is coming down from the stage to meet everybody . Please , everyone , look but do n't touch . " When the hostess finished her speech , " Little Cutey " walked down the stage , her hand held in that of a handsome male volunteer , and circled the audience one time .  
Although the intended targets of sanctions were countries that over-exploited resources held in international waters , the amendment included a provision to the effect that whenever the secretary of commerce or secretary of the interior learns of trade or other forms of exchange , by foreign nationals , that directly or indirectly harms international conservation programs for endangered or threatened species , they should submit certification of this fact to the president .  
As these five ports were all close to the teagrowing areas of southern China , the supply of tea became abundant and uninterrupted , and after the Treaty of Nanking the huge stocks of tea held in London 's warehouses expanded so much as to become a worrisome burden .  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
He once carried out a rather funny " group therapy , " for which he filled a large bucket with electrical conductors like glass , water , and magnetized iron . Amid them he erected an iron bar , upon which was tied a needle . He then pulled out a lot of wire and guided the magnetic flux to the sick areas of his patients ' bodies . The patients held onto the wire while sitting in a circle around the bucket .  
" Moon Children " was originally selected as material for a show to be aired over public television . But this " magnum opus " of more than 70 episodes laboriously filmed over two years was held up by administrative procedures at public television , which wanted to air it reduced to 44 minutes , in two segments .  
As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery . This year 's special exhibition of jade from private collections will also be housed there ; meanwhile the Contemporary Art Gallery 's own special exhibition " Creating from Tradition : a Taste of Our Modern Art " is being held in the newly-completed Documents and Library Building , and includes the works of 1O modern craft workers . Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
The Huayu Foundation has held seven classics courses for children . Every time the kids come to class , they must first put on dark blue robes and bow in front of a statue of the great sage Confucius . Then , while sitting cross-legged at low tables , the class recites fluently in loud and clear voices from the works of the Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai , " I set myself to understand the ways of Heaven and Earth , and to bring peace and stability to the people .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
The Chinese dance tradition is broad and deep . In the Zhou dynasty , the government established official forms of music and dance , and viewed them as an integral part of education . In the Han , the court held ritual performances , and at banquets guest and host would take turns leading in dances .  
Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat . The great masters that are held up for imitation today discovered long ago the best way to achieve the most beautiful composition and shape for each character . Copying them is essential .  
The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue . But there was innovation in form . Mao 's wife Jiang Qing , who held tremendous power , assembled some of the greatest operatic talents in the country to figure out how to turn the traditional forms of Peking opera into something that would work for modern people .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
In the context of such an impressive and long-lasting buxiban culture , the Committee of Taipei Historical Records held a seminar in September of last year on " Examination-Oriented Supplementary Schools in Retrospect . " They invited a wide number of Taipei City 's senior pedagogues , such as the prestigious 1970s buxiban teachers Hsu Chen-liang and Chang Chin-wen , affirming the decades of educational work they contributed and expressing the hope that one day , when exemplary teachers are listed on Teachers ' Day , buxiban teachers will have a place too .  
In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns . This is surely the most direct proof one could ask for of the esteem in which our ancestors held spices .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
In the middle of May the second East Asian Games were held in Pusan , South Korea . During the 10 days of tightly scheduled competitions , athletes from nine different Asian nations and territories competed in 13 different sports . Mainland China , Japan and South Korea topped the medals chart , but ROC athletes also performed well , especially the men 's basketball team , which won a thrilling one-point victory over South Korea to earn their first gold medal in over 43 years of international competition .  
Take for example coverage of a demonstration in January 1993 , held by two groups ( mostly those opposed to " Taiwanese consciousness " ) to " Support the Lee-Hau System ; Support Another Term as Premier for Hau Pei-tsun . " After comparing the headlines and contents of the various newspapers , Chang discovered that the Taiwanese-oriented Liberty Times emphasized negative themes such as " the situation was disorderly , " and " the demonstration won little public support . " In follow-up commentaries the paper was critical of the demonstrators .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors . The collective photo which all the leaders lined up for is permeated by the style and passion of Southeast Asia . It makes a strong impression on anyone who sees it , wherever they may be from .  
Suddenly , it seemed , all the previous procedural problems-such as the fact that the petroleum industry law has not yet been implemented , or the amended power industry law is still held up in the Legislative Yuan-had been wished away overnight ! The privatization process is still very uncertain . Indeed , the very term itself is often misunderstood , and used in a simplistic or distorted way .  
Aiming to reach a new segment of society , HEPP has held its promotional activities in places crowded with the fashionable and cultured elite of Taipei-such as department stores , the Eslite bookstore group ( a key cultural barometer for Taipei ) , and Crown Art Center .  
Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly .

In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
When the rhododendrons began flowering in March , the annual round of recruitment fairs got under way on campuses all over Taiwan . Graduates of National Taiwan Normal University ( NTNU ) always used to have an " iron rice bowl " - a guarantee of a job in teaching . But since the Ministry of Education relaxed entrance requirements for the teaching profession , they too have faced the same problem that " graduation equals unemployment , " and for the first time ever a recruitment fair has been held on the NTNU campus .  
When someone has exhausted all avenues of appeal in the heavenly bureaucracy , the god which steps in fortuitously to save the day is one with an immortal facet to its character . These are the gods to which people turn for help . They make trouble for authority . Unlike the god Chenghuang , who must stay put at Chenghuang Temple , where his actions are held in check by a multi-tiered celestial bureaucracy , Lu Dongbin is often discovered wandering far away from the shrine in southeast Taipei that is devoted to his worship .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year . In his presentation he noted that on average he reviews 20 applications for investment every day . He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .  
After winning first prize for Young Designer at the second annual awards , Paul Shen went on to carry off the gold medal at the inaugural Fashion Design Competition for Young Designer of Asia , held in Taiwan the following year .

Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 . The committee has confirmed that it has arranged for a total of NT $ 283 billion from a number of sources to buy shares . The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
In the end Frank Hsieh won by a tiny margin of just over 4,000 votes . Political observer and National Sun Yat-sen University professor Chen Mau-hsiung has argued that Wu Den-yih originally held the upper hand in the election , but lost women 's votes as a result of the tape-recording affair . In contrast , the later video merely compounded the dissatisfaction of the electorate , contributing to the DPP gaining control in southern Taiwan .  
Wang Anyi 's short story was a trailblazer , because it appeared at a time when communist ideology still held considerable sway in the literary sphere . " Wang feels that there is no need for a writer to play the part of a social scientist and use a novel as a means of criticizing anything . She has always focused on the individual .  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
The bronze statue has sharp facial features-bushy eyebrows , big eyes that glare at the viewer , an aquiline nose , and a tightly closed mouth that reaches very nearly from ear to ear . The facial muscles are tensed , the expression is solemn , and both arms are held out in a circle , as if performing some kind of sacred rite .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
From the traditional Taiwanese perspective , medicine is the most elevated of professions , and many important Taiwanese families have pursued careers in this field . In the past , the medical community , the native Taiwanese elite and the opposition were held to be nearly synonymous . Now , this association has been shattered by Chang Chau-hsiung . It is no wonder that some in the DPP have described him as a " traitor . "  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
This year , on the seventh day of that month , one tour bus after another wound up a twisting mountain road , bound for a gathering at the True Buddha School 's Vijaya Temple in Tsaotun , Nantou County .

Though held late at night , it attracted thousands of devotees . Dressed in blue robes , they chanted the sect 's sutras with deep concentration .  
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s . Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet . The success of Wu Bai &amp; China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .  
Though Lang witnessed war and brutality in one of China 's most turbulent and tragic eras , these experiences never effaced the love that the traditional Chinese literati always held for the beautiful landscape . Thus , with a product of Western technology in hand , he embarked on an effort-conditioned by his own cultural learning and by the model of the Chinese landscape painting-to create composite images of different landscapes separated by space and time .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
Since the middle of this year , Citibank ( acting through Debenham Tie Leung , a property management firm based in Hong Kong ) has held a series of auctions in Taipei and Kao-hsiung to sell properties from defaulted mortgages at steep discounts .

Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .

While we should not allow that individual consensual elements of the reform process be held hostage to progress in unrelated issues , there seems to be an evident need to reach a political agreement , at least on the basic philosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
We would therefore be deeply appreciative if this understanding were translated into tangible results and if the subsequent technical discussions held following political consultations were much more fruitful .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
Three months before general elections are to be held , the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice , keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties .  
The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Wilmot ( Ghana ) : At the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , world leaders took tough political decisions and committed themselves to create an economic , political , social , cultural and legal environment that would enable people to achieve social development and social justice .  
In this connection , it is pertinent to mention the recent meeting held in Oslo in April 1996 on the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , according to which interested developed - and developing-country partners will allocate 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
Although 1996 began on a promising note with the peaceful and democratic general elections held in Palestine on 20 January , a series of devastating terrorist attacks against Israel in late February and early March quickly enveloped the spirit of optimism surrounding the peace process in a sombre and cynical cloud .  
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan . 
We would like to emphasize , however in accordance with statements made by the Heads of State and Government of the Ibero-American Conference recently held in Chile that it is our position that the problems of that region must be solved in accordance with the constructive spirit of the agreements concluded between the parties involved , while protecting the legitimate rights of all the inhabitants and guaranteeing access to holy places , in full respect of international law .  
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation .

Among the positive developments during the past month are a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations ; a further reduction in hostile propaganda ; the release of additional prisoners registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ( while the Government has freed all 353 such prisoners held by it , UNITA has so far released 139 ) ; the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions ; and continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 out of the 10 planned quartering areas .

Condemns in the strongest terms all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict , recognizing that the leadership in territories under the control of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and formerly Serb-held areas of the Republic of Croatia , the commanders of Serb paramilitary forces and political and military leaders in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) bear primary responsibility for most of those violations and that persons who commit such acts will be held personally responsible and accountable ;  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;

As a result of discussions held at the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts on Public Administration and Finance , organized by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , in New York , in August 1995 , it was recommended that consideration should be given to establishing training programmes addressed to the most senior levels of the civil service at national , subregional or regional levels to improve the capacity of government to deal with emerging issues of civil society for the revitalization of civil services .  
25-Five sixths of the countries reported that ill or injured persons held in custody who required medical treatment were always transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
We have always held the view that the progress achieved jointly by the Israelis and the Palestinians for the peace and common prosperity of the region is undeniable proof that any regional dispute , no matter how deep-seated and complex , can eventually be solved through dialogue between the parties directly concerned .  
We note that the Permanent Representative of Lebanon , as reflected in document S / 1996 / 280 , requested that the Council convene an urgent meeting on the afternoon of Sunday , 14 April , given the grave developments in his country .  Speaking during the debate on Palestine held earlier today , the Malaysian representative referred to the worsening situation in the Middle East .  
I have the honour to draw your attention to the increasing deterioration in the social and political situation in certain regions of my country as a result of the obvious reluctance of the forces opposing the constitutional authorities to settle outstanding questions by peaceful means , particularly through the mechanism of the inter-Tajik talks which are being held under the auspices of the United Nations .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
The report also indicated that , under prevailing conditions and logistics , the earliest possible date on which elections could be held would be late February or early March 1997 , on condition that the outstanding policy issues are resolved by mid-October , failing which a further delay would be unavoidable .  
In other words , the regulation provided in article 7 is satisfactory neither to the State planning a new activity ( since it will be held liable for any harm caused even though the activity may constitute equitable and reasonable utilization ) nor to the State suffering harm from this activity ( which is entitled only to consultations if the first State has exercised due diligence ) .  
A training programme for members of human rights organizations included short seminars on human rights investigation , forensic anthropology and judicial reform , as well as a two-week intensive course on various aspects of human rights work .

Taking into account the understanding that emerged from discussions held on issues relating to programme element I . 1 during the second session of the Panel and at national , regional and international meetings after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , including the expert meetings on financial mechanisms and on the Implementation of the Forest Principles ( see para . 5 ) , the Panel may wish to consider endorsing the elements of national forest programmes discussed below as applicable to all types of forests .

The mission was of the view that , under prevailing conditions and constraints , the earliest possible date on which elections could be held would be late February or early March 1997 , and that holding elections during that period would depend on outstanding policy issues being resolved by mid-October , failing which a further delay would be inevitable .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
However , indicators pointing to a potential deterioration in the humanitarian situation have accumulated since early 1996 , particularly in southern Somalia , and , by the middle of the year , United Nations agencies were uncertain how much longer a renewed humanitarian crisis could be held back under prevailing conditions .  
As follow-up to the Summit , the Economic Commission for Europe ( ECE ) planned two workshops to be held in 1996 ; the first , on managing the social consequences of structural change in transition economies ( Paris , 1 and 2 July 1996 ) , provided a forum for joint reflection and exchange of experiences between experts and senior officials in charge of economic and social policies in both transition and developed market economies .  
ESCAP has prepared and disseminated a publication on enhancing the role of non-governmental organizations in implementing the regional Agenda for Action ; convened a regional workshop on guidelines for implementing the Agenda ; held an expert group meeting on the enhancement of social security for the poor ; and a meeting of senior officials on a policy framework for lifelong preparation for old age .  
The International Council on Social Welfare , made up of a wide range of local , national and international organizations with special interests on issues related to social welfare and social development , adopted Summit follow-up as its top priority and held regional follow-up seminars for non-governmental organizations in Africa , Asia Pacific , Latin America and Europe .  
Towards that end , they resolved seriously to consider fresh policy options in order to give proper effect to the segments of the Final Declaration of the Fourth Conference , held at Pyongyang , dealing with South-South cooperation as a key element in increasing information capabilities at the national , regional and global levels .  
Accordingly , we not only commit our own efforts but also call on international , hemispheric and regional intergovernmental organizations to participate actively in organizing and following up the tasks to ensure that the summit on sustainable development to be held in Bolivia on 7 and 8 December 1996 is a historic occasion , laying the foundations of a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development that will be the core of national and international actions geared to meeting economic , social and environmental objectives .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
In view of the sharp exacerbation of the crisis in Afghanistan , a meeting of the Security Council must be held immediately with the participation of the countries concerned for the purpose of drawing up urgent measures to halt the bloodshed , bring about a political settlement of the conflict and extend assistance to the civilian population and the numerous refugees .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .

As indicated in Declaration No . 1 / 488 , SLORC set itself four objectives : first , the re-establishment of peace and tranquillity in the country ; second , the restoration and provision of communication and transport ; third , measures to ensure better supply of food , clothing and shelter by facilitating the operations of private enterprise and the cooperatives in these sectors ; and fourth , when the first three measures would have been accomplished , the holding of multi-party democratic elections to be held in a free and fair manner .  
We propose that a special meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations should be held without delay , with the participation of interested countries , with a view to adopting urgent measures to halt the fighting and achieve a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan conflict , and to arrange for the provision by the international community of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and refugees .  
These constants are : ( a ) It was made clear to the Special Rapporteur during all the meetings he held with representatives of the Government of the Sudan at the highest level that the political agenda of the Government will not change : the principles and the basic regulations laid down in constitutional decrees 1 to 13 as amended , will be strictly observed in the policy-making process and no change will be made to these principles and basic regulations .

In his special report , the Commissioner-General draws attention to the critical state of UNRWA 's finances , the serious structural deficit facing the Agency , the austerity measures already taken to reduce the deficit as much as possible , the impact of the measures on the quality and level of services to Palestine refugees and the implications of the reduction of services for the stability of the area .  3 .  The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
Such conferences include the World Summit for Social Development , 10 / held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , which stated that it recognized and supported indigenous people in their pursuit of economic and social development , with full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural values .  
Third , the multilateral system should be strengthened ; in that regard , the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , to be held in Singapore , would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .

Since many questions and misunderstandings surround the definitions and content of the terminologies of sects , new religious movements and even formal religion and since in international practice confusion reigns and States may have diametrically opposed attitudes to the same group , raising it to formal religious status or pejoratively classifying it as a sect , the Special Rapporteur feels that an international high-level governmental conference should be held to study and decide upon a common approach to sects and religions that respects human rights . 
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
This mandate is underlined by paragraph 11 of the Secretary-General 's report in response to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 ) , in which the Secretary-General recalled that the Security Council had condemned " the practice of ' ethnic cleansing ' and the massive , organized and systematic detention and rape of women , and reaffirmed that those who commit or have committed or order or have ordered the commission of such acts will be held individually responsible in respect of such acts " .

Second , the so-called parliamentary elections held in May 1996 in Kashmir had been neither free nor fair , but had been conducted by the Indian army under extreme coercion in contravention of the existing Security Council resolutions , as extensively reported in the international media .  
Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , he said that India , despite having accepted the decision of the Security Council that a free and impartial plebiscite should be held to determine the legal status of that region , had resorted to unilateral measures to occupy the territory and had prevented the Kashmiris from exercising their right to self-determination as recognized in Security Council resolutions which were still valid and binding on all the parties : India , Pakistan and the United Nations .

The question of displaced persons has been fundamentally settled between the two sides through the agreement on the exchange of populations reached between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna from 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary regrouping of populations , each in its own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots in the south ( see S / 11789 of 5 August 1975 ) . 
These expressions of concern notwithstanding , an active electoral campaign was conducted by all major political parties , including those that had boycotted the second round of parliamentary elections held two years ago .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
The question is limited to a small number of individual and isolated cases in which the offenders are held accountable and punished , in case the investigation and the judicial verdict prove it , in the light of the State 's desire to ensure the enforcement of the law while showing no indulgence towards offenders of the crime of torture , as reflected in the detailed replies of the Egyptian authorities to the Committee .

The overwhelming peaceful demands of the Kashmiris for self-determination in the disputed territory , which had never been a part of India , were not a matter of religious extremism , terrorism or secession , as India maintained , but could be satisfied only by the holding of the plebiscite advocated by the international community , for which the universally denounced sham elections recently held by India were no substitute .
