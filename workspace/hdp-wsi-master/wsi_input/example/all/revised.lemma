International public opinion has focused on the fact that in this book approved by the Japanese Government , the " New History Textbook Writing Committee " has , under the slogan of making some " corrections to Japanese history textbooks ' tendency toward national abuse , " distorted historical facts and completely whitewashed its invasive war , denying the serious crimes that Japan committed during World War II .

Furthermore , since international cooperation would have to be strengthened , as the Secretary-General had stated in his report ( A / 51 / 309 ) , the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others of 1949 , to which fewer than half of the Member States were party , should be revised and a new body established with responsibility for examining reports on the implementation of that Convention , in order to make it more effective .

The system of municipal and prefectural agricultural committees , which played a central role in agricultural land reform as the primary administrative organization , was also revised .  
To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .  
The Assembly decided that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions , in the amount of $ 86.2-million at revised 19981999 rates , which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 ; and that additional requirements shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of Assembly resolution 41 / 213 .

The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
It was noted that the proposed programme of work for 20002001 was the first programme formulated on the basis of the cumulative reform efforts of the Commission , which included the conference structure as determined by the Commission in 1997 , the programme structure as revised and approved by the General Assembly in 1998 and the subsequent organizational structure as presented in the proposed programme budget for 20002001 .  
Opinions were sought also from experts in restrictive business practices in some developed countries and international organizations regarding the quality of the analytical studies prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat and the commentaries on the model law , which are revised periodically .

The Advisory Committee was informed that with respect to the actuarial costs related to the identified 349 Russian citizens covered under the proposed agreement , as required by the protocol attached to the proposed agreement ( see annex VI to the Board 's report ) , revised actuarial estimates would be calculated , taking into account the new proposed implementation date , which was 1 January 1997 . 
While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
Although the special circumstances of developing countries are recognized in many specific instances throughout the revised version , there is no separate chapter or annex devoted to those circumstances ( as in the previous version ) .

During the Habitat II process there was renewed political commitment to the implementation of new or revised national shelter policies based on the enabling approach , as there is growing recognition that better policies not only improve housing conditions but also increase the impact of the housing sector on local and national economies .  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
The delegation that had introduced a revised version of document A / AC . 252 / L . 2 ( A / AC . 252 / 1997 / WP . 10 and 12 ) as a result of the first round of discussions noted that the changes introduced in article 1 , paragraph 4 , contained an enlarged definition of armed forces that included the security forces and restricted the concept of other persons accompanying them to those who acted in support of the armed forces and were under their command and control .  
In addition to a general definition of certification authority , the revised definitional article should contain a definition of licensed , authorized or accredited certification authorities , which could be based on paragraph ( 1 ) of draft article B .

The revised model Contribution Agreement between the United Nations and participating States contributing resources to United Nations peacekeeping operations contained in the annex to the present note has been submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51 / 218 E of 17 June 1997 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Contribution Agreement1 fully reflects the reports of the Phase II and III Working Groups of Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment2 and to issue an appropriate corrigendum to the Agreement .

The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
The revised proposal was based on the premise that the maintenance of international peace and security required true and effective democratization of the existing system of international relations and that the democratization of the United Nations was an equally indispensable condition for strengthening its role in the maintenance of international peace and security .  
In this connection , it will be recalled that , consistent with established practice , the revised appropriation for 1996-1997 reflects actual exchange rates experienced in the first year of the biennium ( 1996 ) and projected rates for the second year ( 1997 ) based on the rate realized in December 1996 .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
Also in its resolution 51 / 59 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to distribute to all States the International Code of Conduct for Public Officials , annexed to that resolution , and to include it in the manual on practical measures against corruption , to be revised and expanded by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 14 , with a view to promoting its use in advisory services , training and other technical assistance activities .  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .

Theo van Boven ,  
That strategy was already yielding results : between 1992 and 1996 , per capita income had risen substantially , while rural poverty had declined ; direct elections to new village committees had been held in the majority of municipalities , provinces and autonomous regions and the revised criminal code had established , inter alia , the principle of equality before the law .  
Also taking note of resolution 1996 / 28 of 29 August 1996 of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in which it decided to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights the revised text of the basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law prepared by the former Special Rapporteur Mr .

Following the official announcement of the results of the recently concluded elections in Liberia , I am pleased to inform you of the successful completion of the electoral process , which constituted the final element of the revised schedule of implementation of the Abuja Agreement . In support of the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) played an effective and critical role in bringing about this outcome .  
Furthermore , since international cooperation would have to be strengthened , as the Secretary-General had stated in his report ( A / 51 / 309 ) , the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others of 1949 , to which fewer than half of the Member States were party , should be revised and a new body established with responsibility for examining reports on the implementation of that Convention , in order to make it more effective .  
Other activities included working jointly with the World Bank on ( a ) a revised and updated Glossary of the legal and economic terms fundamental to competition law and policy ( to be published in 1997 ) , an earlier version of which has been translated into several languages , including Russian and Spanish ; and ( b ) a Competition Manual for transition and developing countries ( to be published in 1997 ) .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .  
Moreover , the rules generally applicable to reservations were sufficiently flexible and adaptable to be applied with equal authority in the case of human rights and other normative treaties and should not be revised .

The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
The system of municipal and prefectural agricultural committees , which played a central role in agricultural land reform as the primary administrative organization , was also revised .  
To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .  
The Assembly decided that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions , in the amount of $ 86.2-million at revised 19981999 rates , which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 20002001 ; and that additional requirements shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of Assembly resolution 41 / 213 .  
Comprehensive revised guidelines for these types of contracts have been developed and will be implemented in 1999 , bearing in mind the primary objective of achieving value for money in an efficient and expeditious manner .

The revised budget for 1998 / 99 also provides for the replacement of obsolete and damaged refrigeration , water-purification and industrial laundry equipment required to support the MINURCA military personnel after the departure of the French logistical contingent .  
Seen in relation to the total annual appropriations for ESA programmes and other national programmes , the financial leeway for full implementation of a revised space policywith respect to previous commitments to such programmesis relatively limited , at least in the short term .  
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
It was noted that the proposed programme of work for 20002001 was the first programme formulated on the basis of the cumulative reform efforts of the Commission , which included the conference structure as determined by the Commission in 1997 , the programme structure as revised and approved by the General Assembly in 1998 and the subsequent organizational structure as presented in the proposed programme budget for 20002001 .  
Opinions were sought also from experts in restrictive business practices in some developed countries and international organizations regarding the quality of the analytical studies prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat and the commentaries on the model law , which are revised periodically .  
The Committee noted that requests for revised estimates should normally be limited to provisions required to accommodate unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances , and that there was a need for greater predictability in the level of advisory and custodial fees .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .

Russia firmly believes that if an overall understanding is reached in good time on the key parameters of the future CFE , this would enable the States parties to comply with the existing treaty in the light of the understanding and not resort to special procedures during the period leading up to the completion of talks on the adaptation and the conclusion of a revised treaty .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,

Since the sixth session of the Commission , a functioning prototype of the system has been developed , consisting of a revised international site and a demonstration national node , and mock-ups of regional and institutional nodes .  
Taking into account the fact that data on some cross-sectoral areas such as national institutions and administrative capacity , regional institutions and technical cooperation , and some data on science and technology are subsumed under sectoral areas in the revised DAC purpose classification codes on which the analysis of the data is based , one can conclude that a number of important programme areas have not yet received adequate attention from the international community . 
Included under this heading are : ( a ) differences between actual average salary and common staff costs compared with the standards included in the revised appropriations ; ( b ) differences between realized vacancy rates compared with those assumed in the revised appropriations ; and ( c ) adjustments to objects of expenditure other than posts based on actual and anticipated requirements to the end of the biennium .

The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .  
The role of the Working Group on Communications , under the revised procedure , is to examine communications and any governmental replies with a view to bringing to the attention of the Working Group on Situations any particular situations which appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms . 11 The Working Group of the Subcommission will now meet after the annual session of the Subcommission rather than before , as was previously the case .

The delegation of authority to senior managers was rarely respected and observed ; actions formally approved could be revised at the last moment ; and consultative input into executive decision-making was brought to a minimum .
