Unfortunately , there is no reliable comprehensive data on the economic aspects of natural disasters ; as a result policy makers can not base their decisions on documented facts , and cost-benefit analyses of specific natural disaster prevention or reduction measures are often questionable .  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .

Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .

The milestones reported were the following : ( a ) Economic Commission for Africa ( ECA ) : the enhancement of the capability to generate reliable and timely environmental statistics and indicators ; ( b ) Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) : the development and strengthening of the national capabilities of the statistical offices in the region so that the regular and systematic collection of a minimum set of environmental statistics and indicators for a selected group of countries in the region could be achieved ;  
Recommended that the provision of timely , reliable and accurate information on the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation , as well as on the multiple roles of forests , which is essential for public understanding and informed decision-making , should be assured ;  
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness , accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , Taking note of the establishment , within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , of Reliefweb , for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies ,  
If democratization is the most reliable way to legitimize and improve national governance , it is also the most reliable way to legitimize and improve international organization , making it more open and responsive by increasing participation , more efficient by allowing for burden-sharing and more effective by allowing for comparative advantage and greater creativity .  
The Committee noted that , while net national income ( NNI ) , the measurement currently used , might in principle be a better guide to measuring capacity to pay , it involved an adjustment to GNP for depreciation , for which estimates were generally less reliable and comparable , as they were often based on varying assumptions about the rate at which the capital stock was depleted .  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Similar expectations also exist for the quality and quantity of information and contributions made by the major groups themselves : in the next phase , their inputs will need to be more accurate , unique and reliable , while their organizational structures will need to be increasingly transparent and accountable .  
Specific , reliable actions within the context of well-established programmes with clearly defined goals deserve special attention .  In conclusion , all partners - Governments , national and international organizations , churches , women and men must make a commitment to ensure that Zairian women and men will work together , hand in hand , for a harmonious society and a credible and prosperous country .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
The rapid development and enthusiasm for the clearing-house mechanism illustrates the widely recognized need for reliable and accurate information to ensure effective implementation of the CBD . The exercise has also demonstrated the complexity of establishing an effective and accessible global clearing-house mechanism .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
In view of the continuing widespread violations of human rights in Kosovo as reported by the Special Rapporteur , the opening of an office of the High Commissioner in Prishtina , as well as an increased presence of other international organizations , would be indispensable for gathering reliable information on future human rights developments .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .  
An economy that results in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service is a false economy and the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget are realistic and reliable .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .

Given the fact that , on the one hand , legal rules were largely non-existent while existing rules were at times contradictory and , on the other hand , the use of electronic media had gained such overwhelming importance in international trade , it was clear that reliable and binding rules were badly needed .  
Unfortunately , there is no reliable comprehensive data on the economic aspects of natural disasters ; as a result policy makers can not base their decisions on documented facts , and cost-benefit analyses of specific natural disaster prevention or reduction measures are often questionable .  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
It was suggested that the surveys might be focused only on urban areas or on a selected number of representative administrative and territorial units within the national territory of a State for which the most complete and reliable data were available .  
The activities will also aim at ( a ) providing the United Nations , the international relief community and potential recipient countries with an operational tool giving access to the exact , reliable and up-to-date data on the existing disaster management capacities that can be called upon at short notice in case of emergency ; and ( b ) creating conditions for the United Nations system and the international community as a whole by facilitating their access to the required emergency humanitarian aid and its expeditious delivery to the disaster-affected population .  
In this regard , the Netherlands stated that institutional and human capacity , a reliable regulatory and a supportive legal system , as well as stable and sound macroeconomic policies , were among the central building blocks to attract domestic and international capital to finance development .  
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
A view widely shared by Governments was that the formulation of effective recommendations for action had to be based on a solid understanding of the various aspects of international migration and development , and on reliable information regarding the multifaceted experience of the countries involved in the international migration process .  
Although no reliable data exist on the prevalence of drug abuse in Afghanistan , anecdotal evidence suggests that it has increased during recent years , which may be explained as a consequence of the hard living conditions caused by a prolonged war , combined with the increasing availability of both opium and heroin .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
The deployment of drug control as a political mechanism , in whatever form , by countries against other countries , will have grave , adverse consequences for effective and reliable international , regional and bilateral cooperation .  
However , wider use of digital signatures requires adaptation in national legal frameworks so as to enable such technologies to achieve the intended objective of providing a truly reliable and trustworthy electronic environment .  
It is the task of the national statistical system to make available to government , the public and the private sector relevant and reliable statistical information for economic , social , cultural and environmental developments in a country ;

We believe that the establishment of a reliable system for European security and stability is possible only on a common European basis with unswerving observance of international law and by making use of the potential of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) as the most representative and universal common European organization capable of dealing with all the challenges of the twenty-first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian ones .  
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
We are convinced that the construction of a reliable system of European security and stability is possible only on a pan _ European basis , in a context of unswerving respect for international law , and using the potential of OSCE as the most representative and universal all _ European organization which can address all the challenges of the twenty _ first century - political , economic , military and humanitarian .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
In addition , sample surveys and qualitative studies , such as the rapid assessment approach , are common sources for data on a large number of economic , social and demographic issues ; but they are not always large enough to provide reliable estimates on indicators for smaller population groups , such as indigenous populations , or on characteristics such as disability that affect a very small proportion of the population ;  
A genuine commitment of all concerned parties at the national as well as the international level is needed to ensure a routine flow of reliable statistics and indicators at the country level , which meets national needs for information , and for the integrated and coordinated follow-up to global conferences and summits .  
The Programme is playing a catalytic role in the development of a comprehensive and reliable international monitoring mechanism , including the development of a scientifically sound yield assessment methodology and the determination of yield figures for selected countries to guide and assess the progress of measures implemented by the international community to eliminate or significantly reduce the illicit cultivation of cannabis , coca and opium poppy by the year 2008 .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
The new INTERSPUTNIK satellite fleet will provide for digital television channels , videoconferencing , cellular television broadcasting , interactive services , multimedia , high-bit rate access to the Internet , expansion of very small aperture terminal ( VSAT ) Earth station networks , tele-medicine and tele-education , banking services and reliable communications on a global basis .

To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
The Committee recalled that at its fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth sessions , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 C of 23 December 1993 , it had undertaken a thorough and comprehensive review of all aspects of the scale methodology with a view to making it stable , simpler and more transparent while continuing to base it on reliable , verifiable and comparable data . 
With the advantage of providing synoptic coverage of large areas at regular intervals , coupled with the advances made in computer-aided digital analysis and data fusion , spaceborne multi-spectral measurements made by Earth observation satellites offer an immense potential for generating reliable , timely and cost-effective information on natural resources .  
Recognizing the principal importance of providing prompt , reliable and affordable access to outer space on a non-discriminatory basis for the successful development of space activities , the promotion of the development of international cooperation in launch services is currently essential .  
These preventive national measures include : adequate national legislation and enforcement measures to monitor and control national arms production and licit small arms transfers as well as to combat illicit ones ; detailed and reliable national records on small arms transfers and national holdings ; safe and secure storage of national stocks of small arms procured for self-defence and national security purposes ; responsible policies on disposal of surplus small arms ;  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
The meeting also identified a number of constraints in the development of microcredit programmes , including the lack of reliable sources of finance , especially at the start of a programme ; difficulty of determining appropriate interest rates on loans for the poor ; lack of an enabling environment due to unfavourable government regulatory systems ; and hostile banking sectors and lack of support for training institutions .  
In contrast , the benefit expected from the Uniform Rules in favour of certain techniques , which were recognized as particularly reliable , irrespective of the circumstance in which they were used , was to create certainty ( through either a presumption or a substantive rule ) , at or before the time any such technique of electronic signature was used ( ex ante ) , that it would result in legal effects equivalent to those of a handwritten signature .  
Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
The view was expressed that , irrespective of whether draft article 6 established a presumption that the data was signed or a mere presumption that the electronic signature was technically reliable and linked to a given message , the burden of rebutting such presumptions might be too onerous in the context of consumer transactions , which might need to be excluded from the scope of draft article 6 .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
Such perceptions of flaws in the existing Accord have led to pressure for regulatory changes , and underlie the new initiative of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision for its reform . 16 The approach now envisaged rests on three pillars : minimum capital requirements , supervisory review of capital adequacy in accordance with specified qualitative principles , and market discipline based on the provision of reliable and timely information ( discussed in paras . 10-11 above ) . 
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
The strategy is based on a ) a determined policy to improve the exploitation of water resources ; b ) strengthening of the national facilities for research on agriculture in arid areas ; c ) a consistent and sound policy for achieving reliable food supplies ; and d ) an overall approach that displays lasting consistency towards the economic operators ( farmers , stockbreeders , processing concerns , etc . ) , which can be affected by many types of hazard .  
It is also important that in the region of north and south America a reliable information and data network be set up which would make it possible to establish a warning system to prevent illicit trafficking and to coordinate action to counter and curb such trafficking , including the tracing of networks and organized rings .  
The investigators must also establish the actual identity and nationality of the mercenary , go through the files , rule out altruistic voluntary enlistment , compile information on recruitment and training centres , follow the trail of covert operations , obtain reliable data on aspects relating to the payment and other benefits agreed upon and detect the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , etc .

The dynamic development of the financial system and the capital market demand reliable ground rules and strong regulatory frameworks in order to guarantee the stability of the relevant systems and the adequate protection of savers .  
PARIS 21 is key to efforts to have reliable statistics to monitor these goals as well as other , complementary indicator lists such as the United Nations common country assessment indicators and the minimum national social data set ( MNSDS ) .  
On the basis of the foregoing and given all of these facts , the Government of the Republic of Iraq urges you to order a prompt inquiry , to be conducted by reliable medical and scientific authorities in cooperation with the relevant Iraqi scientific bodies , into the use of depleted uranium against Iraq and to expose such use as a direct cause of injury to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and of damage to all aspects of the environment .  
UNIDO also had a local role to play in helping to establish a reliable and transparent legal and economic environment conducive to direct foreign investment .  
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) timely , reliable and relevant national statistics on economic and social areas will be made available , especially gender-sensitive statistics ; and ( b ) member States are fully committed to further enhancing the capacity of statistical staff on various statistical issues and packages presented by ESCWA , and to this end their full participation in training workshops conducted by ESCWA will be instrumental .  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .

The UNDP Environment Policy Adviser and the Procurement Adviser have developed basic environmental guidelines , an overview of the key issues involved , sources of detailed and reliable information and generic recommendations on major procurement items for use by the Advisory Committee on Procurement and country offices .  
The need for reliable early-warning information and a deep and careful understanding of local circumstances and traditions is therefore of great importance , and the fundamental inequities need to be identified and addressed in development planning and programming .  
The objective of actions by LDCs and their development partners is to provide a reliable physical infrastructure , which is essential for efficient operation of existing productive assets and enterprises , attracting new investment , and assuring meaningful economic development .  
Accessibility to reliable and affordable energy was very unevenly distributed , both between countries and within countries , and many developing countries faced an urgent need to provide adequate , reliable and affordable energy services to millions of people in rural areas .  
I urge the Security Council and the General Assembly to provide , from the outset , reliable , sufficient and sustained funding for international efforts , whether existing or future international tribunals , arrangements established in the context of United Nations peace operations , or initiatives undertaken in concert with individual Member States , to bring to justice perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .

As regards record-keeping , views were expressed that there was also a need to establish agreed minimum standards ; it was noted that national systems for record-keeping could vary according to differing national circumstances and regulatory arrangements , provided that national authorities ensured that the systems in their country were sufficient to enable individual arms to be identified and traced in a timely and reliable manner .  
Given the typically sudden character of natural disasters , and of the often total disruption of public telecommunication networks resulting from their impact , the provision of reliable , independent telecommunications links is a prerequisite for efficient assessment of damages , mobilization of resources , coordination of operations and acquisition of information for dissemination through information systems , such as ReliefWeb .  
The reported drop in mortality rates during the past year is not completely reliable owing to incomplete medical registration processes , limited by high administrative fees and the unsatisfactory introduction throughout the country of the recommendations of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for the registration of live births .
