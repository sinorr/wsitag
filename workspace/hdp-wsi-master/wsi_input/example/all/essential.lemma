" We had thought we could sell 5,000 this year , but because we ca n't get compressors we 'll only be able to sell upwards of 3,600 . "  
In the era when " cutting trees for foreign exchange " was the principal aim of the Republic of China 's forest policy , the Yuli District Forest Office preserved a stand of 60 stout camphor trees by the middle stretches of the Chingshui River .

With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .

Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
Bangladesh strongly felt that the independent status of major information centres should be maintained and where necessary restored , and expected the Department of Public Information to take urgent action in respect of the Centre in Dhaka and nominate a director for the Centre . 89 .  Bangladesh attached the highest priority to freedom of speech and the media , in the belief that democracy , development and peace were integrally related and that the free flow of information was an essential component of democracy .  
Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
It was essential to monitor the efficacy of the international human rights norms that were the basis of the work of the treaty bodies and the efficacy of the special procedures and thematic machinery which played an irreplaceable role in the effective promotion and protection of human rights .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
" Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Fully aware of the enormous risk inherent in the presence of a large number of refugees along their shared borders , the three States , acting together and backed by UNHCR in particular , have continually sounded the alarm and requested the assistance of the international community for a triple operation they considered essential : the repatriation of the refugees to their respective countries ; the disarmament of some 40,000 runaway Rwandan soldiers and their adjuncts , the interahamwe militia ; and finally , encampment in areas far from the frontiers for refugees who opted to remain abroad .  
In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
The Government and Brazilian society were resolved to work together to ensure full enjoyment of civil , economic , social and cultural rights , as well as political freedom , which was essential to improve the standard of living of the population .  
As respect for fundamental rights and freedoms was an essential precondition for peace and security in the world , and for the prevention of international disputes and conflicts , Governments must , in order to strengthen international human rights monitoring machinery , report in a timely fashion on the manner in which they fulfilled their treaty obligations and must be required to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteurs , working groups and experts .  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
" Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
The Special Committee also noted the significant work accomplished by personnel provided by some Member States on loan to the Organization , including in specialized areas essential to support of peacekeeping operations , and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the recruitment and use of loaned personnel was consistent with the requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations , including that due regard be paid to wide geographical representation .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
" Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
These organizations could help , through international and regional meetings , to sensitize countries to pressing bioethical issues , notably those raised in the primary health care context , and to foster a North-South dialogue in this area , aimed at achieving broad universal consensus on the essential principles of contemporary bioethics and their implementation in the health and related sectors ( principle 4.1 ) .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,

Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
Recommended that the provision of timely , reliable and accurate information on the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation , as well as on the multiple roles of forests , which is essential for public understanding and informed decision-making , should be assured ;  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
The World Conference on Human Rights ( Vienna , June 1993 ) in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stated that human rights education , training and public information were essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding , tolerance and peace .  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
The holding of elections last September , with broad participation by the citizenry ; the gradual establishment of new , joint multiethnic institutions ; economic reconstruction ; the restoration of essential public services ; and internationally , mutual recognition between neighbouring States : these are all obvious steps forward .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
While differences in the economic , social , cultural and historical circumstances of the world 's societies mean that differences will continue between democracy as viewed by one society and democracy as viewed by another , democracy is increasingly being recognized as a response to a wide range of human concerns and as essential to the protection of human rights .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Coordination of international actors is essential to avoid waste and duplication and , more importantly , to avoid conflicting advice from technical consultants , programmes working at cross purposes and over-funding of or inordinate attention to particular aspects of the democratization process to the detriment of others ; the last could lead in turn to an imbalance between the capacities of State and civic institutions .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
He considered the creative freedom for women to express themselves , to create and nourish culture and to bring into the light suffering that stays hidden because of societal taboos an essential means to overcome the many manifestations of the use of violence against women , which can negatively affect their enjoyment of the right of freedom of opinion and expression .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
Within our region my country took an active part in drawing up the presidential statement on a commitment to democracy , signed by the Heads of State of the members of the Southern Cone Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , together with Chile and Bolivia , which established that the full and effective functioning of democratic institutions was an essential condition for cooperation in MERCOSUR . 
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr ï¿½ al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;

Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
Instead of this differentiation , advocacy work will be treated as an essential component of all of the organization 's work , since it is a critical element in enabling UNIFEM to influence policy changes and legal reforms at a systemic level , both within the United Nations system and at regional and country levels .  
It is a dynamic long-term process , including economic and social development as essential elements , seen in perspectives that may change over time , and leading to improved quality of life for all human beings , the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequality .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Convinced that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic , social and related fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of its subsidiary bodies located in the developing regions ,  
The Conference of Ministers of ECA was convinced that trade and investment were essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate development in the countries of Africa and sustain high rates of economic growth , and that poverty , which constituted the most serious problem facing African society , could be reduced and eventually eradicated by sustained high rates of economic growth that was broad-based and geared to creating employment and generating rising incomes .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
The role of the geospatial framework was recognized as critical for economic and sustainable development and the integration of the " 3S technologies " ( remote sensing , GPS and GIS ) was seen as essential for efficient management of natural resources .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
At a moment when the fragility of the ambient political , social and economic context is placing additional pressures and burdens on the recently laid foundations of the key institutions that underpin the rule of law , the continuing presence of MICIVIH remains essential to the consolidation of democracy . 
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Underlines the observation of the Secretary-General that the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration of the Region is the full cooperation of the Government of the Republic of Croatia , which bears the responsibility for convincing the local population that the reintegration of the people of the Region is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible ;

An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
Following the rapid and massive return of refugees in late 1996 and early 1997 , UNICEF focused on quickly expanding essential services in Rwanda , such as health , nutrition , education and social services , to meet the urgent needs of returning children . 
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
Resources required would specifically maintain a core capability , allowing the Base to fulfil essential functions , handling rapid surges of activity through the provision of temporary additional resources drawn from the budgets of the closing or new missions involved .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
The Parties believe that it is essential to continue to make joint coordinated efforts with a view to establishing , in the area within the purview of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , bilateral and multilateral international relations based on the generally accepted principles and norms of international law ;  
Noting that , despite the successful conclusion of the inter-Tajik talks and the efforts of the Government of Tajikistan to allocate limited resources to returning refugees and displaced persons , the economic situation in Tajikistan remains bleak and essential social services are largely dysfunctional , making a large percentage of the population extremely vulnerable ,  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
The intimate relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation commitments , on the one hand , and free trade and cooperation for peaceful purposes , on the other , is reflected in this article , and it is thus essential that the careful balance be preserved as the Convention is implemented .  
It is therefore a timely and an opportune moment to hold this emergency special session of the General Assembly , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 377 ( V ) , entitled Uniting for peace , to deliberate on this crucial issue and all its essential aspects .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
Convinced further that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic and social fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of Headquarters and the subsidiary organs located in the developing regions ,  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
Without prejudice to the foregoing , it is essential that the authorities should put an immediate end to all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and impose criminal and disciplinary penalties on those responsible .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .  
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The ongoing programmes are essential and deeply appreciated .  The conduct of the forthcoming elections and other challenges outlined in this report will make the coming couple of years crucial in the efforts to build a society in Cambodia that respects all the human rights of all the people .  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .

The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .

While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .

Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .

The majority of Ch'en Keng-pin 's photos are of natural scenery , where his employment of crystal-clear priorities and a delicate , quality feel took the place of the typically obscure , artificial beautification of other photographers .

On the other hand , however , objective social and economic conditions , the establishment of a democratic model for the populace , and the promotion of rational behavior are especially essential to democracy .

Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
Lin Ming-te says emphatically , " We are always calling for a Chinese cultural renaissance , and saying that modern architecture should be imbued with a traditional aesthetic . It 's a shame that one essential element is conspicuously missing from the vast majority of large public structures exhibiting a classical Chinese flavor - - the traditional poetic couplet . Most homes also give little thought to the content of their New Year 's couplets . "  
Even more tragic is that over the past two year , with a strategy of doing low-cost contracting , Sampo has attained substantial sales for air conditioners there . Unfortunately , in so doing it evoked the envy of the Japanese industry . Matsushita and Mitsubishi , major manufacturers of the compressor , an essential part , cut the supply in half . " We had thought we could sell 5,000 this year , but because we ca n't get compressors we 'll only be able to sell upwards of 3,600 . "  
In the era when " cutting trees for foreign exchange " was the principal aim of the Republic of China 's forest policy , the Yuli District Forest Office preserved a stand of 60 stout camphor trees by the middle stretches of the Chingshui River .

Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
In the history of Chinese cities , fire-fighting measures were most thorough during the Song dynasty . Song cities resembled those of today 's Taiwan , with residences and places of business mixed together , streets less than fifty paces wide with alleys branching off them , buildings that rubbed up against each other , and great diversity within the population . With the city so tightly packed , fires spread quickly . This made fire fighters essential public servants .  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities .

Although many people remain skeptical about duplicating the characters of the ancient masters , thirtysomething artist Tu Chung-kao expresses the opinion that throughout history the number of literate people was exceedingly large , and to be able to make a lasting impression for all time is no mean feat .

In 1980 , when the North Link Railway was completed , this stretch of track , essential for connecting the east and west coast main lines , became even more important .

Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence .

Chinese have been drinking tea for thousands of years , and it has long been a routine part of daily life .

Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China .

ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry .

Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .

Renews its commitment to further strengthening international cooperation and substantially increasing efforts against the cultivation for illegal purposes , illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotics and psychotropic substances , including synthetic drugs , and to control and prevent the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic and psychotropic substances , in accordance with obligations of States under the United Nations drug control conventions , based on the principle of shared responsibility and taking into account experience gained ;  
The rule of law is understood as a human right in itself but also as essential means for the protection of all human rights , civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
In the least developed countries and in a number of African countries where the private sector was weak , the public sector should play an active role in establishing the basic essential infrastructure , and international cooperation should focus on countries and sectors where the lack of such infrastructure was most acute .  
Three critical factors would allow UNHCR to fulfil its role in ever more complex environments : respect must be ensured for its unique mandate of refugee protection ; a collective commitment to respond to emergencies and resolve humanitarian crises was essential ; and it was vital that UNHCR was fully equipped to carry out its mission .  
It is also important to set the ways and means to achieve this by utilizing not only official development assistance but also private investment , trade , social infrastructure building , human capacity development , and all other elements which are essential to achieving those targets , as well as by devising an ideal policy mix to suit the concrete socio-economic conditions of the countries involved .  
Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management , administrative and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economic and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
" Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Recognizing that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Xenophobia , intolerance and false doctrines of racial superiority gave rise to acts of discrimination and violence against vulnerable groups , migrant workers and foreigners ; it was therefore essential to give the highest support to the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination , a framework which would make it possible to address the political manipulation of intolerance through new efforts at the national and international levels .  
Bangladesh strongly felt that the independent status of major information centres should be maintained and where necessary restored , and expected the Department of Public Information to take urgent action in respect of the Centre in Dhaka and nominate a director for the Centre . 89 .  Bangladesh attached the highest priority to freedom of speech and the media , in the belief that democracy , development and peace were integrally related and that the free flow of information was an essential component of democracy .  
Accordingly , the Governments role should be confined to its core functions , namely creating a sound legal and macroeconomic framework , protecting the environment , ensuring order and security and providing infrastructure , education , social protection and essential public services .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
It was essential to monitor the efficacy of the international human rights norms that were the basis of the work of the treaty bodies and the efficacy of the special procedures and thematic machinery which played an irreplaceable role in the effective promotion and protection of human rights .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
" Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Fully aware of the enormous risk inherent in the presence of a large number of refugees along their shared borders , the three States , acting together and backed by UNHCR in particular , have continually sounded the alarm and requested the assistance of the international community for a triple operation they considered essential : the repatriation of the refugees to their respective countries ; the disarmament of some 40,000 runaway Rwandan soldiers and their adjuncts , the interahamwe militia ; and finally , encampment in areas far from the frontiers for refugees who opted to remain abroad .  
In particular , the Special Committee had concluded that , although there had been a decline in the number of United Nations personnel deployed on peacekeeping missions in the past year , it was still essential for the United Nations to be able to respond to threats to international peace and security ; it had observed in that connection that lessons must be learned from recent experiences and efficiency must be enhanced with a view to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the prevention of conflicts .  
The Government and Brazilian society were resolved to work together to ensure full enjoyment of civil , economic , social and cultural rights , as well as political freedom , which was essential to improve the standard of living of the population .  
As respect for fundamental rights and freedoms was an essential precondition for peace and security in the world , and for the prevention of international disputes and conflicts , Governments must , in order to strengthen international human rights monitoring machinery , report in a timely fashion on the manner in which they fulfilled their treaty obligations and must be required to cooperate with the United Nations special rapporteurs , working groups and experts .  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
It was also essential to ascertain the truth about the thousands of missing persons ; to assist the victims of genocide , rape and abuse ; and to bring to justice all instigators and perpetrators of crimes against humanity and grave violations of international humanitarian law .  NULLIn view of the crucial need for human rights education , a special publication had been produced containing the texts of all the international human rights instruments stipulated in the Dayton Peace Agreement .  
" Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
The Special Committee also noted the significant work accomplished by personnel provided by some Member States on loan to the Organization , including in specialized areas essential to support of peacekeeping operations , and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the recruitment and use of loaned personnel was consistent with the requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations , including that due regard be paid to wide geographical representation .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
In an earlier report , JIU had expressed the view that it would be premature and even counterproductive to delegate essential functions before human resources management policies were formulated , all personnel procedures were reviewed and improved , proper demarcation of responsibilities in human resources management was established between OHRM and other offices and departments , and appropriate mechanisms for reporting and accountability were put in place .  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
" Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
These organizations could help , through international and regional meetings , to sensitize countries to pressing bioethical issues , notably those raised in the primary health care context , and to foster a North-South dialogue in this area , aimed at achieving broad universal consensus on the essential principles of contemporary bioethics and their implementation in the health and related sectors ( principle 4.1 ) .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
The Committee 's evaluation should be seen as decisive for the image of the State in question and should supersede national self-judgement where racial and ethnic issues were concerned , since racism and ethnic conflicts constituted an essential component of the overall human rights equation .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,

Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
Recommended that the provision of timely , reliable and accurate information on the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation , as well as on the multiple roles of forests , which is essential for public understanding and informed decision-making , should be assured ;  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
The World Conference on Human Rights ( Vienna , June 1993 ) in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action stated that human rights education , training and public information were essential for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding , tolerance and peace .  
Finally , we did find offensive the implicit or explicit suggestion that the Tribunal should exhibit impartiality by , in future , indicting the same number of people from each ethnic background .  That truly would be a perversion of justice that would transform the Tribunal into a political court designed to serve the political expediency of some , or refashion history and ignore the essential foundation of individual responsibility .  
The holding of elections last September , with broad participation by the citizenry ; the gradual establishment of new , joint multiethnic institutions ; economic reconstruction ; the restoration of essential public services ; and internationally , mutual recognition between neighbouring States : these are all obvious steps forward .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
While differences in the economic , social , cultural and historical circumstances of the world 's societies mean that differences will continue between democracy as viewed by one society and democracy as viewed by another , democracy is increasingly being recognized as a response to a wide range of human concerns and as essential to the protection of human rights .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
Coordination of international actors is essential to avoid waste and duplication and , more importantly , to avoid conflicting advice from technical consultants , programmes working at cross purposes and over-funding of or inordinate attention to particular aspects of the democratization process to the detriment of others ; the last could lead in turn to an imbalance between the capacities of State and civic institutions .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
He considered the creative freedom for women to express themselves , to create and nourish culture and to bring into the light suffering that stays hidden because of societal taboos an essential means to overcome the many manifestations of the use of violence against women , which can negatively affect their enjoyment of the right of freedom of opinion and expression .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
It must be realized that official development assistance is an essential part of the cost-sharing needed in the global partnership to address priority global social concerns such as poverty eradication , not to mention that such a source of external finance is critical to many capital-starved countries , and also to the least developed countries .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
Within our region my country took an active part in drawing up the presidential statement on a commitment to democracy , signed by the Heads of State of the members of the Southern Cone Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , together with Chile and Bolivia , which established that the full and effective functioning of democratic institutions was an essential condition for cooperation in MERCOSUR . 
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr ï¿½ al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
For many of today 's major environment and development concerns , the sciences ( including the social and human sciences ) are essential in detecting and analysing the problem , in identifying solutions and in ensuring scientifically sound action .  This has been particularly evident for the ozone depletion issue , and increasingly also for other issues such as climate change , erosion of biological diversity and water and coastal pollution .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
HIV / AIDS demonstrates the indivisibility of human rights since the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , as well as civil and political rights , is essential to an effective response .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
Recognizing that investment in human capital and domestic and international policies supportive of economic and social development are essential prerequisites for the eradication of poverty ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;

Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
Instead of this differentiation , advocacy work will be treated as an essential component of all of the organization 's work , since it is a critical element in enabling UNIFEM to influence policy changes and legal reforms at a systemic level , both within the United Nations system and at regional and country levels .  
It is a dynamic long-term process , including economic and social development as essential elements , seen in perspectives that may change over time , and leading to improved quality of life for all human beings , the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequality .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
Early implementation of key public investments would result not only in increased aggregate demand , employment and incomes , but in a recovery of private investment - an essential factor for a more sustained , self-reliant economic growth and significantly improved security .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The formal removal of barriers and the introduction of temporary special measures to encourage the equal participation of both men and women in the public life of their societies are essential prerequisites to true equality in political life .  
Convinced that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic , social and related fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of its subsidiary bodies located in the developing regions ,  
The Conference of Ministers of ECA was convinced that trade and investment were essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate development in the countries of Africa and sustain high rates of economic growth , and that poverty , which constituted the most serious problem facing African society , could be reduced and eventually eradicated by sustained high rates of economic growth that was broad-based and geared to creating employment and generating rising incomes .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
The role of the geospatial framework was recognized as critical for economic and sustainable development and the integration of the " 3S technologies " ( remote sensing , GPS and GIS ) was seen as essential for efficient management of natural resources .  
The protective nature of the most fundamental human rights and the defence of institutions which safeguard them and which justify the temporary suspension of certain rights and freedoms explain why international monitoring bodies with increasing precision and clarity have been tying the exercise of this exceptional measure to the defence of democracy , which is understood not only as a particular form of political organization that it is unlawful to attack but as a system that lays down absolute limits for the unfailing observance of certain essential human rights .  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
At a moment when the fragility of the ambient political , social and economic context is placing additional pressures and burdens on the recently laid foundations of the key institutions that underpin the rule of law , the continuing presence of MICIVIH remains essential to the consolidation of democracy . 
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
The human rights system has the legal obligation to observe the economic system and to signal the greater or lesser impact it is having in meeting the needs of individual human beings and on their enjoyment of essential civil , economic , social , political and cultural rights .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Underlines the observation of the Secretary-General that the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration of the Region is the full cooperation of the Government of the Republic of Croatia , which bears the responsibility for convincing the local population that the reintegration of the people of the Region is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible ;

An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
His Government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the global climate and conserving biological diversity for present and future generations and felt that the international community should recognize that , to preserve the planet , global willingness to tackle the task was essential ; if action was delayed , the cost could be devastating . 
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
Following the rapid and massive return of refugees in late 1996 and early 1997 , UNICEF focused on quickly expanding essential services in Rwanda , such as health , nutrition , education and social services , to meet the urgent needs of returning children . 
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
Resources required would specifically maintain a core capability , allowing the Base to fulfil essential functions , handling rapid surges of activity through the provision of temporary additional resources drawn from the budgets of the closing or new missions involved .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Those organizations had been in general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , was essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
Though we fully realize that peace and security , as well as stability , in the region of the Middle East will be achieved only when a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its dimensions is attained , it is essential to create the necessary climate and security conditions based on equal security for all , security at the lowest level of armament , and security that would not allow for the military superiority of any individual party .  
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;

Stresses its solidarity with people living in poverty in all countries , and reaffirms that the satisfaction of basic human needs is an essential element of poverty eradication , those needs being closely interrelated and comprising nutrition , health , water and sanitation , education , employment , housing and equal opportunities for participation in political , economic , cultural and social life ;  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
The Parties believe that it is essential to continue to make joint coordinated efforts with a view to establishing , in the area within the purview of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , bilateral and multilateral international relations based on the generally accepted principles and norms of international law ;  
Noting that , despite the successful conclusion of the inter-Tajik talks and the efforts of the Government of Tajikistan to allocate limited resources to returning refugees and displaced persons , the economic situation in Tajikistan remains bleak and essential social services are largely dysfunctional , making a large percentage of the population extremely vulnerable ,  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
In this context , the Special Rapporteur recalls the need for accurate , balanced and impartial coverage of current affairs including , inter alia , by allocating air time to parties and candidates on a fair and non-discriminatory basis during the period preceding elections , referenda or other important political events when it is essential that voters and candidates alike engage in a free and open discussion of views on pertinent issues . 
While noting that similar bodies either were exploring the possibility of introducing such a mechanism or had already adopted an additional protocol , the Committee believed that , if the principle of the indivisibility , interdependence and interrelatedness of civil and political , and economic , social and cultural rights was to be upheld in the work of the United Nations , it was essential that a complaint procedure be established under the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
If it is decided to broaden the scope of application of the basic principles and guidelines to include all violations , and all the more so if that alternative is rejected , it would seem essential for the document to explain what is meant by gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , which constitute crimes under international law .  
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
By eliminating the world 's third biggest nuclear arms stock , and by recently signing a number of basic bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the charter on special partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , Ukraine has made an essential contribution to strengthening European and world security , thus having a concrete input in implementing the lofty goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .  
It recognized that social development continued to be a national responsibility , but at the same time stressed that the support , firm commitment and collective efforts of the international community were essential if the objectives defined in Copenhagen were to be achieved .  
In this spirit , it is essential and urgent that the international community strive for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , and an increase in the share of funding for social development programmes commensurate with the scope and scale of activities required to achieve the objectives and goals of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development . 
While recognizing that international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full implementation of the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , my delegation is very well aware of the primary role that Governments and civil society must play at the national level towards the fulfilment of the objectives set forth .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
My country understands and agrees with the principles that motivate today \ x { e5b8 } action by the international community : prohibiting parties to a conflict from choosing from an unlimited range of ways and means of combat ; prohibiting the use of weapons and means of combat that cause excessive damage or unnecessary suffering ; and drawing the essential distinction between combatants and civilians not involved in the fighting .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
The intimate relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation commitments , on the one hand , and free trade and cooperation for peaceful purposes , on the other , is reflected in this article , and it is thus essential that the careful balance be preserved as the Convention is implemented .  
It is therefore a timely and an opportune moment to hold this emergency special session of the General Assembly , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 377 ( V ) , entitled Uniting for peace , to deliberate on this crucial issue and all its essential aspects .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
Convinced further that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic and social fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of Headquarters and the subsidiary organs located in the developing regions ,  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
Without prejudice to the foregoing , it is essential that the authorities should put an immediate end to all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and impose criminal and disciplinary penalties on those responsible .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
Taking into account the level of methodologies and their complex nature , the formulation of a clear , practical set of guidelines or manual for the application of the SEEA is considered essential and is being called for by a growing number of countries .  
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The ongoing programmes are essential and deeply appreciated .  The conduct of the forthcoming elections and other challenges outlined in this report will make the coming couple of years crucial in the efforts to build a society in Cambodia that respects all the human rights of all the people .  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .

The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,

The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
Although no concerted move has yet been made by the system to set up the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline data necessary for a comprehensive impact evaluation of operational activities , there have been extensive efforts within JCGP to prepare a common country assessment that , once established , could provide basic data against which progress could be measured .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
While it is the primary responsibility of national Governments to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of Agenda 21 , it is essential that international cooperation be reactivated and intensified , recognizing , inter alia , the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set forth in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration .

While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
As the illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are serious and growing concerns in the region , the development of an accurate annual estimate of the situation and trends is essential to the successful development and implementation of regional strategies and subregional programmes .

In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
In its second Advisory Opinion , the Inter-American Court stated that the ' essential ' judicial guarantees that are not subject to derogation according to article 27 include habeas corpus , amparo , and any other effective remedy before judges or competent tribunals which is designed to guarantee respect for the rights and freedoms whose suspension are not authorized by the American Convention .  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
In principle , there is general agreement that an accurate and transparent impact assessment , based on a common approach to or understanding of the issues involved , is essential both to design the appropriate domestic policy response and to seek adequate external assistance in coping with the side effects of sanctions .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .

Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The Group of 77 and China had always held the view that the problems of development could not be reduced to their economic component but rather involved a set of social problems and situations and of equally essential ethical and political factors that formed part of an integral whole whose common denominator was the right of every man and woman to a life of dignity and a future of hope .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .

As the Council underlined , the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration is the full cooperation of the Government of Croatia , which bears the ultimate responsibility for convincing the local population that their reintegration is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible .  
In supporting that regional effort , we view it as essential that an unequivocal signal should be sent to the junta that the whole international community firmly stands behind the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone under the popularly elected President , Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah .  
Information centres are an essential partner in this effort , whether establishing strong working relationships with the local media and responding to their inquiries ; cooperating with civil society and other local partners to promote major United Nations themes ; disseminating the Department 's products , such as booklets , brochures or United Nations radio and video programmes ; maintaining reference libraries ; translating the Department 's material into local languages ; servicing visits of the Secretary-General and other senior officials to their host countries ; or maintaining liaison with Governments .  
The concept of coercive economic measures embraces a variety of issues related to : ( a ) identification of essential elements , distinctive features and limitations of a definition of such measures ; ( b ) specification and classification of motives and policy objectives of sender States in resorting to economic coercion against target States , in particular developing countries ; and ( c ) categorization or selection of specific types of relevant measures , as well as analysis of their anticipated and actual effects .
