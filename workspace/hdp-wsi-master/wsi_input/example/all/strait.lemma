The eight-point proposal was put forward in good time exactly at such a historical moment , and it therefore evoked great repercussions on both sides of the Taiwan Straits , and among the circles of overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals residing in overseas areas ; meanwhile , the international community also cherished the hope that the two sides of the strait could seize the opportunity to promote their mutual relations , and make contribution to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region .  
Whether it is in terms of blood relationship and geographical ties , or tradition or culture , the two sides of the strait are an inseparable entity , which has been universally recognized by the international community and a common understanding of all the Chinese descendants at home and abroad .  
With peaceful reunification , there will be reciprocal exchange , mutual cooperation , resources and market sharing , joint development and prosperity across the strait , but we do not want your money , nor collect taxes from you .  " Apart from letting you folks govern Taiwan , you can also take part in the management of China-wide affairs .  It is better than hiding in Taiwan with fear and trepidation , without any idea of the future , is it not ? "  
Having conducted heated discussions on the current situation across the strait , and on ways to promote the cross-strait relations and push forward China 's reunification process on the basis of the one-China principle , and having fully expressed the strong aspiration of opposing " Taiwan independence , " safeguarding peace , and promoting reunification among people from all social circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in Hong Kong and Macao , the two-day-long seminar on " Opposing Taiwan Independence and Promoting Reunification " came to a close today in Shenzhen , Guangdong Province .  
Insightful people in Taiwan held that though the new leader of Taiwan authorities verbally expressed his " goodwill intentions " and " sincerity " in improving the cross-strait relations , his actual deeds ran contrary to what he said .  Presently , he wants to hinder even the exchanges between cities on both sides of the strait .  This man-made obstacle will make the cross-strait relations more strained .  
Chen Shui-bian expressed his belief that the leaders on both sides of the strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity , and are absolutely able to find some " common ground " and consensus acceptable to both sides , so as to jointly handle the issue of " a future one China " based on " existing foundations " .  
The " mini three links " are not genuine links .  They are not conducive to improving exchanges between the people on both sides of the strait , or to stimulating the sluggish Taiwan economy .  Neither are they popular among the Taiwan people .  
In recent years , with the joint efforts made by compatriots on both sides of the strait , cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation have become close and closer .  The annual volume of trade between the two sides has exceeded $ 20-billion .  Every year , there is over 10-million tons of cargoes to be transported .  Realizing direct links in trade , transportation , and postal services across the Taiwan Strait has become an urgent need in the further development of cross-strait economic and trade relations .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .  In fact , relevant authorities in Taiwan had earlier planned to adopt this system .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
The ideology of which we often speak should refer to the socialist and capitalist systems ; but now , advocating " coexistence of two systems " actually means abandoning the original idea of putting politics in command and instead regarding the two different systems on the two sides of the strait as a contradiction among the people within " one country , " to be handled as such ; what is wrong with changing an antagonistic contradiction between the enemy and ourselves into a non-antagonistic contradiction among the people ?  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
The mechanism for talks between the two associations on the two sides of the strait is presently still the most feasible and workable consultative channel .  The government has not considered changing or adjusting the consultative mechanism for the two associations from the two sides of the strait .  The operational mechanism for the two associations is sufficient for responding to and handling cross-strait issues , and it is still not yet time for changing it .  
The new Taiwan leader inherited Li Denghui 's " Taiwan independence " line , negated the " 1992 consensus , " insisted on continuing the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy , set up barriers to the opening of direct " three exchanges " across the strait , openly asserted that " unification is not the only option , " and perused money diplomacy to expand their " international space . "  He is sliding farther down the road of splitting the country .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
During the " Wang-Koo talks " eight years ago , Chairman Wang Daohan especially stressed : The world economy is evidently becoming regionalized .  If the people on the two sides of the strait , who belong to the same nation , strengthen their exchange and cooperation , demonstrate their respective strengths , and work to complement and benefit each other at a time when the world economic structure is changing , we certainly can become more competitive , and we Chinese people can demonstrate our strengths in international competition .  
The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .  
fifth , the US decision to link NMD with TMD overseas is bound to harm regional peace and stability ; should the United States being Taiwan into the east Asia TMD , this will be organizing a US-Taiwan military alliance in disguise , interfering in China 's internal affairs , and increasing the tension in the Taiwan strait .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
However , along with the progress of the times and the development of the situation , with the addition that there exist no fundamental interest conflicts between the Chinese on both sides of the strait , such " complexes " and " knots in the heart " between the Chinese across the strait can all be undone gradually in a benign interaction .  Has this not clearly proved by the increasingly close economic , trade , and cultural ties between the Chinese across the strait over the past more than a decade ?  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
In the future , both sides of the strait should keep in mind regional union and national reunification , eliminate political interference from separatist forces , work to promote reciprocity and mutual benefit for both sides of the strait in economics and trade , and create a new win-win and mutually beneficial situation of cooperation and exchange .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
He does not recognize the one China principle , and negates the 1992 ARATS-Strait Exchange Foundation consensus on each side of the strait interpreting in oral form its " adherence to the one China principle " ; he has continued to practice the policy of " no haste , be patient , " blocked direct cross-strait " three links , " pushed " Taiwan cultural independence , " stepped up expansion of armaments and buying arms from abroad , and carried out activities to split the motherland in the international arena .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .  The Taiwan leader 's refusal to admit he is a Chinese and recognize the principle of one China and his deliberate attempt to evade the basic fact that the two sides of the strait belong to one country are the most representative of this .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
Fishing folks along the southern Fujian coast are devout believers in the goddess Matsu and look upon her as a " strait goddess " who " makes her power felt on the sacred sea " and protects fishing folks against marine perils .  Hence , fishing folks have built by the seaside one temple after another for worshipping the goddess Matsu . On Dongshan Island you can also see such southern Fujian buildings with carved beams and walls and colorfully painted , upward tilted eaves that have been built for generations .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out that the relevant department of the Taiwan authorities should promptly change its irrational stipulation , rectify its erroneous practice , and conscientiously take effective measures to ensure the sound development of news exchanges across the strait ; otherwise , the Taiwan side should be held responsible for the likely consequences of seriously affecting news exchanges across the strait .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .  
We hope that the relevant department of the Taiwan authorities will promptly correct this erroneous practice , agree , as soon as possible , to let Xinhua continue the regular posting of its reporters and news-gathering work , prevent the reoccurrence of similar problems and , at the same time , take effective measures to change the irrational stipulations in order to conscientiously ensure the sound development of news exchanges across the strait .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
The 16 November letter indicated that , " Your association 's representatives propose that at this working discussion , with the precondition of mutual understanding , each side will use the verbal statement method to express the one-China principle , and propose the specific content of the expression , and this will make it explicit that both sides of the strait support the one-China principle .  This content will thereafter be conveyed to Taiwan publications . "  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
It is rather ignorant of history and the current situation and quite arrogant for Chen Shui-bian to sell the old stuff in 2000 .  This is of no help for easing up the tense situation across the strait .  The Chinese people have waged a struggle against the US theory asserting that " Taiwan 's status is not yet settled " for more than four decades and the US ultimately recognized that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and there is only one China in the world ;  
A spokesman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Dang said in Beijing today : When interviewed by a Hong Kong media unit a few days ago , Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] brazenly stuck to the stance of " Taiwan being a sovereign state " and argued that the two sides of the strait are two states of the Chinese based on the so-called " remote relative and close neighbor " theory .  Hence , she flagrantly challenged the one-China principle .  
In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .  
He noted : The one-China principle involves China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and involves the fundamental interests and dignity of the Chinese nation ; and since it is the most precious asset that the people on both sides of the strait have left to their future generations through shedding blood and engaging themselves in hard struggles , the one-China principle enjoys a sacred and inviolable position .  
Even though they do their utmost to play crafty tricks , saying that the two sides of the strait are two states and saying in another way round that the two sides of the strait can form a confederation or a compound state in the form of two sovereign states , this argument is not tenable in terms of legal principle and will not be recognized by the international community .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .

However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
At present , Taiwan 's military expenses exceed $ 10 billion per year .  As long as the hostilities between the two sides of the strait are terminated , Taiwan will be able to save a huge amount of military expenditure and shift the financial resources to social welfare and other fields which need the resources more urgently .  This will obviously be beneficial to the people of Taiwan .  
His aim and sinister ambition was to portray himself as a saint protecting the democracy and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and to imply that the government of the Chinese mainland and the CPC , which oppose his criminal behavior , are an autocratic devil opposed to democracy and human rights , in a bid to stir up bad feeling between the Taiwan compatriots and the mainland of the motherland and pin on it the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan strait and for a possible war .  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
However , through the sudden change in the world history , the Taiwan authorities only caught sight of splittism and the " strategically favorable chance " of " creating another China . " As a result , the dregs under the Taiwan Strait were floating and the evil wind was blowing over the strait , thus turning the destiny of one China into a political magic and turning the ever-improving cross-strait relations since 1992 into ones " without agreements . "  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
The trends described above indicate that the Taiwan authorities and the military are transforming a " passive defensive strategy " into an " active defensive strategy , " the core of which is to strengthen military " deterrence , " avoid as much as possible a decisive battle on the island , and make great efforts to push the battle ground off the island or even to the west of the center line of the strait or within the mainland .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
The extremist " Taiwan independence " forces are bound to end up badly battered in going against the tide of history by attempting to hoist the tattered banner of the so-called " provisional government of the republic of Taiwan , " calling back the soul of separatism , and attempting to challenge the Chinese people 's resolve and confidence to reunify the country ; they are also bound to be spurned by the Chinese people on both sides of the strait , and rejected by the international community .  
Fan Xizhou , Chen Kongli , Lin Jing , and Liu Guoshen , Taiwan issue experts of the Taiwan Affairs Research Institute of Xiamen University , today expressed their views on " mutual invitations by Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors for mutual visits . "  They said that mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors have positive significance on promoting the two cities ' economic and cultural exchanges and developing their relations .  People on both sides of the strait are optimistically looking forward to the success of their visits .  
Associate Professor Liu Guoshen said : Mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors seem like the first light of the day in the current critical cross-strait relations .  These visits , serving as an opportunity for both sides of the strait to advance toward mutual trust and reconciliation , can not come true because of obstructions by the Taiwan side under " all sorts of pretexts . "  This is regrettable .  
The mainland 's Second Artillery Corps has also developed a whole series of missiles , including various types of missiles for various purposes , short-range and medium-range missiles , as well as intercontinental missiles ; quite a few of which have attained the advanced world standard .  Once an unexpected incident breaks out , the mainland forces will be able to cross the strait and launch a precision strike .  
Some of the experts said that since taking office , the new leader of the Taiwan authorities has continued to be evasive and ambiguous regarding the one China principle and has erected obstacles to the development of cross-strait relations , causing tension in the Taiwan strait ; the Taiwan people have very strong views opposing " Taiwan independence , " and everyone is worried that Taiwan will suffer devastating blows should war break out .  
If the Mainland continues to maintain its fast economic growth as that in the past 20 years and become the world 's largest economy with the greatest market potential in the next two decades as many authoritative international institutions have predicted , it will provide unlimited opportunities for businesses at home and abroad , especially for the businesses in Taiwan , which is only separated by a narrow strait .  This is an important guarantee for the motherland 's prosperity and reunification .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
Lien Chan noted that the KMT already formed a sound mainland-work mechanism when it was a ruling party .  Under this mechanism , he said , the NUC has , since its establishment , carried out its functions of integrating the opinions of the majority of people , safeguarding Taiwan 's security , and stabilizing the situation in the Taiwan Strait . The organization can play an active and positive role in promoting constructive interaction between the two sides of the strait , he added .  
During an interview given to reporters from inside and outside the border , Xi Jinping said that the broad ranks of people in Taiwan had a strong desire for " three exchanges " across the strait some time ago .  Viewed from the current personnel , material , and other exchanges across the strait , Taiwan residents are the most frequent users .  
If war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , and sea transport is blockaded , foreign trade as a support for economic development will suffer serious setbacks , many industrial production departments will halt production and close down , and the entire economy will be facing tremendous blows .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
The military source said that the establishment of the Fuzhou Theater signifies the intensified degree of tension in the Taiwan strait compared with the previous stages and increased possibility of a breakout of a partial war by adding that the military had raised a level of military alert in this theater .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
Recently , to allow " information to be commonly shared " and enhance our three-dimensional penetrating ability in gathering information from across the strait , the Ministry of National Defense even merged the three services ' intelligence collection systems and streamlined the information transmission methods to enliven the armed forces ' coast-based systems of early warning , wartime command , observation , communication , search for carrier terminals , and reconnaissance , thus establishing a very careful entity as well as a mobile and flexible reconnaissance and communication system .  
During the meeting , Ye Xuanping gave a briefing on the achievements in reform and opening up of the motherland 's mainland as well as on the new social look of areas inhabited by the people of the Haka ethnic group .  He sincerely hoped compatriots on both sides of the strait will make great efforts to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese nation , take the culture of the Chinese nation as a link , promote consensus , communication and understanding , and make concerted efforts to promote the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
A cross-strait academic seminar on Dr . Sun Yat-sen was held here a few days ago .  Specialists and scholars from both sides of the strait pointed out that opposing a split and safeguarding national unification are important parts of Dr . Sun Yat-sen 's ideas and that reunification is the only choice of the Chinese on both sides of the strait .  
Finally , the SEF representative " suggested each side state position in verbal form within an acceptable scope for both sides " and put forward additional three oral expression plans .  The number eighth expression plan stated " in the process of both sides of the strait striving to seek the state 's reunification , both sides adhere to the one-China principle although they held different views on the meaning of and understanding of one-China . "  
Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] and others and extremist " Taiwan independence " elements on the island echo each other in dishing up absurd separatist theories such as the two sides of the strait are so-called " distant relatives but close neighbors , " " acknowledging one China means surrender , " and " not mentioning the two-state theory does not mean it does not exist . "  The " Independence Party " has also staged a farce of the " provisional government of the republic of Taiwan . "  
Leaders of the party and state have repeatedly reiterated sticking to the basic guideline of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and President Jiang 's eight proposals , continued to vigorously develop cross-strait economic cooperation , pushed for direct " three links " across the strait at an early date , and welcomed visits by Taiwan parties , bodies , and people of all circles to exchange views and promote consensus on opposing together " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait ties , and promoting the process of peaceful reunification .  
Zhang Qisheng said : The rapid development of cross-strait exchanges has had a far-reaching impact on efforts by the compatriots on both sides of the strait to jointly carry forward the fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation .  It has deepened mutual understanding between compatriots on both sides of the strait and enhanced their sense of responsibility and mission regarding the reunification of the motherland .  
An Min pointed out : For a long time , Taiwan authorities have rejected direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait and adopted a series of obstructive and restrictive policies .  This is out of keeping with the basic demands of the people on both sides of the strait and the development of the situation , and has infringed upon the fundamental interests of the people on both shores , especially the Taiwan people .  This practice is increasingly unpopular .  
Thus , the " measures , " which were drawn up based on these principles , are bound to be warmly received by the industrial and business communities on both sides of the strait .  Moreover , they will benefit our Taiwanese compatriots in fully understanding the relevant regulations concerning trade with Taiwan and bolster confidence in cross-strait trade .  
In 1986 , our ministry announced management measures , and in 1993 our ministry in conjunction with the General Customs Administration promulgated the " Management Measures for Small-Volume Trade with the Taiwan Region . " Small-volume trade is conducted by approved small-volume trade companies under the supervision of Customs and is supplementary to the regular trade across the strait .  Its existence and development has advanced the understanding of the people on both sides of the strait and has played a positive role in encouraging direct trade across the strait .  
Qian Qichen said , back in 1979 , based on the objective requirements of cross-strait economic development and exchanges of various kinds , we proposed the establishment of direct postal , transport , and commercial links across the strait .  It is regrettable that this has not yet been realized due to the obstacles raised by the Taiwan authorities .  
David Shen , director of China Policy Program of Washington 's George Washington University , published an article in the latest issue of a bimonthly magazine : " Foreign Affairs .  In the article , he said : The " confederation " model is " the final and most hopeful " format for resolving cross-strait issues .  He urged the new Bush administration to make vigorous efforts to get both sides of the strait to resume talks so as to avoid the potential crisis that might arise from suspended cross-strait interactions .  
Shortly after the Taiwan authorities started their so-called " mini three links , " the Kuomintang and the New Party separately dispatched their " three links " delegations to visit Beijing and expressed their discontent at the Taiwan authorities ' dilatory and perfunctory practice toward the " three links . "  This also shows that only complete and direct " three links " can really satisfy the urgent needs of the people on both sides of the strait .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .  
Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
He stressed the need to further promote the development of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges , promote the realization of direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date , and the need to seriously listen to the voice of Taiwan compatriots , increase exchanges with all political parties , organizations , and people in Taiwan who oppose division and support national reunification , and jointly make efforts to promote the development of cross-strait relations and realize the motherland 's complete reunification .  
As we enter the new century , faced with the trend of economic globalization and fierce competition , and faced with the progress of science and technology which is changing with each passing day , the compatriots on both sides of the strait should all the more link hands in cooperation to meet the challenges together and make both of them winners in mutual benefit in the economy and in science and technology .  
By uniting in endeavor , the compatriots of both sides of the strait will certainly be able to accomplish the great cause of the motherland 's reunification at an early date , and build our common home into a rich and strong , democratic , and civilized modern nation , thus writing a still more resplendent chapter in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
With the idea of " future one China " that appeared in Chen Shui-bian 's inauguration speech and the " political integration " proposal in his new year message , the mainland , which used to squint at him , has more or less opened their eyes .  The grim situation of confrontation across the strait since the second half of last year has changed or is making a change .  On the other hand , however , the deadlock has not been broken despite the ease of tension to some extent .  
An editorial in Taiwan 's Chung-Kuo Shih-Pao criticized Chen Shui-bian , at a time when the " three mini links " have just been established , exchanges between cities on the two sides of the strait have just begun , and the policy of " no haste , be patient " is being reviewed , for inviting Taiwan independence elements to Taiwan from outside the island and for chanting " Taiwan stands up " loud at the congress , damaging cross-strait relations and " destroying the general situation taking shape " .  
Members of the Legislative Yuan : This year is the fortieth anniversary of the fall of the mainland . Many of us still recall that time just after the government moved to Taiwan , when aid from the international community had been cut off , when everything on the bastion of national recovery was waiting to be done , when the Communists across the strait clamored to " wash Taiwan in blood , " when the storm raged for a time , and the situation was precarious .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
Naval forces : The PRC could use submarines and mobilize motorized fishing vessels to undertake an extended blockade of Taiwan . It could deploy mines in the waters surrounding Taiwan and outlying islands . Using its amphibious capability , it could land a reinforced division . Finally , motorized fishing boats could ferry as many as 350,000 well-equipped support troops across the strait should a beachhead be established in Taiwan .  
Moreover , with relations across the Taiwan Strait unstable and the two sides of the strait still seeking a mutually acceptable model for interaction , extreme positions calling for rapid reunification or independence are not beneficial to the vast majority of Taiwan 's people .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
In fact , contrary to expectations based on previous studies , the deep drilling survey brought to light unexpected geological problems regarding the thickness of the Quaternary filling in the subsoil of the strait .  
The most noteworthy aspect of the results of the survey ( March 1999 ) is that , despite progress in operational terms , which resulted in a near doubling of the maximum penetration achieved in the previous survey , the geological substratum sought in certain critical areas in the central part of the strait has still not been detected .  
The eight-point proposal was put forward in good time exactly at such a historical moment , and it therefore evoked great repercussions on both sides of the Taiwan Straits , and among the circles of overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals residing in overseas areas ; meanwhile , the international community also cherished the hope that the two sides of the strait could seize the opportunity to promote their mutual relations , and make contribution to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region .  
Whether it is in terms of blood relationship and geographical ties , or tradition or culture , the two sides of the strait are an inseparable entity , which has been universally recognized by the international community and a common understanding of all the Chinese descendants at home and abroad .  
With peaceful reunification , there will be reciprocal exchange , mutual cooperation , resources and market sharing , joint development and prosperity across the strait , but we do not want your money , nor collect taxes from you .  " Apart from letting you folks govern Taiwan , you can also take part in the management of China-wide affairs .  It is better than hiding in Taiwan with fear and trepidation , without any idea of the future , is it not ? "  
Having conducted heated discussions on the current situation across the strait , and on ways to promote the cross-strait relations and push forward China 's reunification process on the basis of the one-China principle , and having fully expressed the strong aspiration of opposing " Taiwan independence , " safeguarding peace , and promoting reunification among people from all social circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in Hong Kong and Macao , the two-day-long seminar on " Opposing Taiwan Independence and Promoting Reunification " came to a close today in Shenzhen , Guangdong Province .  
Insightful people in Taiwan held that though the new leader of Taiwan authorities verbally expressed his " goodwill intentions " and " sincerity " in improving the cross-strait relations , his actual deeds ran contrary to what he said .  Presently , he wants to hinder even the exchanges between cities on both sides of the strait .  This man-made obstacle will make the cross-strait relations more strained .  
Chen Shui-bian expressed his belief that the leaders on both sides of the strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity , and are absolutely able to find some " common ground " and consensus acceptable to both sides , so as to jointly handle the issue of " a future one China " based on " existing foundations " .  
The " mini three links " are not genuine links .  They are not conducive to improving exchanges between the people on both sides of the strait , or to stimulating the sluggish Taiwan economy .  Neither are they popular among the Taiwan people .  
In recent years , with the joint efforts made by compatriots on both sides of the strait , cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation have become close and closer .  The annual volume of trade between the two sides has exceeded $ 20-billion .  Every year , there is over 10-million tons of cargoes to be transported .  Realizing direct links in trade , transportation , and postal services across the Taiwan Strait has become an urgent need in the further development of cross-strait economic and trade relations .  
The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the same cultural background ; and the Chinese phonetic alphabet system currently used in the mainland motherland has been practiced and constantly improved for several decades , and has already been widely recognized and accepted in the world .  In fact , relevant authorities in Taiwan had earlier planned to adopt this system .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
In recent years , Communist China has rapidly promoted military modernization and its national strength has continued to grow , while economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait have become increasingly closer .  Besides , the succession of Communist China 's leading power will also take place in the near future .  All those factors have increased the attention of people at home and abroad to the question of arms sales to Taiwan by the United States .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
Sources told us that this large-scale exercise in the South China Sea was based on the background of an incident in the Taiwan strait , with the United States as the main imaginary enemy ; it was imagined that , given the intervention of the US Pacific Fleet , one of the focal points of the exercise to " resist the enemy outside coastal areas and territorial seas " was to counter US military information warfare and reconnaisance .  
According to an earlier report in Jiefangjun Bao , since the Taiwan strait crisis broke out , the United States has frequently sent reconnaisance planes to come and go close to China 's coastal airspace in order to step up its gathering of military intelligence on China , and they have even waited for opportunities to sneak into China 's airspace ; Chinese and US warplanes have frequently engaged in midair confrontation and chases , and this collision was by no means a case of accidentally " going too far . "  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
The ideology of which we often speak should refer to the socialist and capitalist systems ; but now , advocating " coexistence of two systems " actually means abandoning the original idea of putting politics in command and instead regarding the two different systems on the two sides of the strait as a contradiction among the people within " one country , " to be handled as such ; what is wrong with changing an antagonistic contradiction between the enemy and ourselves into a non-antagonistic contradiction among the people ?  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
The mechanism for talks between the two associations on the two sides of the strait is presently still the most feasible and workable consultative channel .  The government has not considered changing or adjusting the consultative mechanism for the two associations from the two sides of the strait .  The operational mechanism for the two associations is sufficient for responding to and handling cross-strait issues , and it is still not yet time for changing it .  
The new Taiwan leader inherited Li Denghui 's " Taiwan independence " line , negated the " 1992 consensus , " insisted on continuing the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy , set up barriers to the opening of direct " three exchanges " across the strait , openly asserted that " unification is not the only option , " and perused money diplomacy to expand their " international space . "  He is sliding farther down the road of splitting the country .  
Featured columns on the website , such as " wonderful natural landscapes , " " cultural treasures , " " urban sights , " and " inside Taiwan , " depict famous mountains and rivers and cultural relics and ancient ruins on both sides of the strait , describe the customs and traditions of various ethnic groups , display the long history and splendid culture of China , and provide first-hand accounts of the enormous changes and developments in China today .  
During the " Wang-Koo talks " eight years ago , Chairman Wang Daohan especially stressed : The world economy is evidently becoming regionalized .  If the people on the two sides of the strait , who belong to the same nation , strengthen their exchange and cooperation , demonstrate their respective strengths , and work to complement and benefit each other at a time when the world economic structure is changing , we certainly can become more competitive , and we Chinese people can demonstrate our strengths in international competition .  
The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .  
fifth , the US decision to link NMD with TMD overseas is bound to harm regional peace and stability ; should the United States being Taiwan into the east Asia TMD , this will be organizing a US-Taiwan military alliance in disguise , interfering in China 's internal affairs , and increasing the tension in the Taiwan strait .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
However , along with the progress of the times and the development of the situation , with the addition that there exist no fundamental interest conflicts between the Chinese on both sides of the strait , such " complexes " and " knots in the heart " between the Chinese across the strait can all be undone gradually in a benign interaction .  Has this not clearly proved by the increasingly close economic , trade , and cultural ties between the Chinese across the strait over the past more than a decade ?  
yet in the long run , truth and justice can always conquer power , and it is not a monolithic block inside the Untied States either .  As long as China 's actual national strength can improve constantly and the people on both sides of the strait can become united , and also with the support and coordination of the justice-upholding people in both the United States and in a majority of countries in the world , China can surely bring true peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
In the future , both sides of the strait should keep in mind regional union and national reunification , eliminate political interference from separatist forces , work to promote reciprocity and mutual benefit for both sides of the strait in economics and trade , and create a new win-win and mutually beneficial situation of cooperation and exchange .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
If Taiwan takes all that is offered , an increase in its military strength is bound to inspire misgivings of the communist China , the two sides of the strait are bound to head for an arms race , and , no doubt , the current cross-strait relations will go from bad to worse .  The arms sales , in which the Chen Shui-bian Government believes it has achieved a major breakthrough , may become a cause leading Taiwan to wars .  
He does not recognize the one China principle , and negates the 1992 ARATS-Strait Exchange Foundation consensus on each side of the strait interpreting in oral form its " adherence to the one China principle " ; he has continued to practice the policy of " no haste , be patient , " blocked direct cross-strait " three links , " pushed " Taiwan cultural independence , " stepped up expansion of armaments and buying arms from abroad , and carried out activities to split the motherland in the international arena .  
In response to a reporter 's question , the spokesman said : We have taken note that to implement their separatist line in an accelerated way , the Taiwan authorities have taken many steps to cut off the cultural and spiritual links between Taiwan and the mainland .  The Taiwan leader 's refusal to admit he is a Chinese and recognize the principle of one China and his deliberate attempt to evade the basic fact that the two sides of the strait belong to one country are the most representative of this .  
A year after a sharp change took place in the Taiwan Strait situation , Taiwan people built their own views and judgement on Taiwan authorities ' threats of " fighting a decisive war offshore " and " bombing the coastal cities on the west side of the strait " .  
Fishing folks along the southern Fujian coast are devout believers in the goddess Matsu and look upon her as a " strait goddess " who " makes her power felt on the sacred sea " and protects fishing folks against marine perils .  Hence , fishing folks have built by the seaside one temple after another for worshipping the goddess Matsu . On Dongshan Island you can also see such southern Fujian buildings with carved beams and walls and colorfully painted , upward tilted eaves that have been built for generations .  
independent culture ? to change the cultural identity of the Taiwan compatriots and then their national and state identities , eliminate their sense of belonging to the Chinese nation , undermine the basis of peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait , and create an ideological and social basis for realizing their separatist plot . 
The KMT 's confederation proposition reads : " The party , on the basis of abiding by the National Unification Outlines and the 1992 consensus about ' one China , with each side of the strait having the freedom to define its meaning , ' seeks to establish a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship , build a mechanism governing mutual trust in the military sphere , and build the Taiwan Strait into a zone of peace .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
The mainland resident journalists have reported in objective fashion on Taiwan 's political , economic , and social situation and its natural conditions and social customs .  Their reports have been welcomed by compatriots on both sides of the strait , increased mainland people 's understanding of the state of affairs in Taiwan , and played a positive role in strengthening cross-strait understanding and contact .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out that the relevant department of the Taiwan authorities should promptly change its irrational stipulation , rectify its erroneous practice , and conscientiously take effective measures to ensure the sound development of news exchanges across the strait ; otherwise , the Taiwan side should be held responsible for the likely consequences of seriously affecting news exchanges across the strait .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .  
We hope that the relevant department of the Taiwan authorities will promptly correct this erroneous practice , agree , as soon as possible , to let Xinhua continue the regular posting of its reporters and news-gathering work , prevent the reoccurrence of similar problems and , at the same time , take effective measures to change the irrational stipulations in order to conscientiously ensure the sound development of news exchanges across the strait .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
So far the Taiwan authorities have not yet renounced its separatistic position that " Taiwan is a sovereign , independent state , " have refused to accept the one-China principle , negated the " 1992 common understanding " and the goal of cross-strait reunification , and continued to carry out separatistic activities internationally ; they have further purchased advanced weapons , attempted to extend their influence by relying on foreigners and to refuse reunification by force .  This is why the root causes of tensions between the two sides of the strait still exist .  
The 16 November letter indicated that , " Your association 's representatives propose that at this working discussion , with the precondition of mutual understanding , each side will use the verbal statement method to express the one-China principle , and propose the specific content of the expression , and this will make it explicit that both sides of the strait support the one-China principle .  This content will thereafter be conveyed to Taiwan publications . "  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
This is specifically expressed in the following ways : The special electronic countermeasures unit which has just been organized is for the first time operating in the Taiwan strait in coordination with military satellite reconnaisance ;  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
It is rather ignorant of history and the current situation and quite arrogant for Chen Shui-bian to sell the old stuff in 2000 .  This is of no help for easing up the tense situation across the strait .  The Chinese people have waged a struggle against the US theory asserting that " Taiwan 's status is not yet settled " for more than four decades and the US ultimately recognized that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and there is only one China in the world ;  
A spokesman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Dang said in Beijing today : When interviewed by a Hong Kong media unit a few days ago , Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] brazenly stuck to the stance of " Taiwan being a sovereign state " and argued that the two sides of the strait are two states of the Chinese based on the so-called " remote relative and close neighbor " theory .  Hence , she flagrantly challenged the one-China principle .  
In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .  
He noted : The one-China principle involves China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and involves the fundamental interests and dignity of the Chinese nation ; and since it is the most precious asset that the people on both sides of the strait have left to their future generations through shedding blood and engaging themselves in hard struggles , the one-China principle enjoys a sacred and inviolable position .  
Even though they do their utmost to play crafty tricks , saying that the two sides of the strait are two states and saying in another way round that the two sides of the strait can form a confederation or a compound state in the form of two sovereign states , this argument is not tenable in terms of legal principle and will not be recognized by the international community .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .

However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
At present , Taiwan 's military expenses exceed $ 10 billion per year .  As long as the hostilities between the two sides of the strait are terminated , Taiwan will be able to save a huge amount of military expenditure and shift the financial resources to social welfare and other fields which need the resources more urgently .  This will obviously be beneficial to the people of Taiwan .  
His aim and sinister ambition was to portray himself as a saint protecting the democracy and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and to imply that the government of the Chinese mainland and the CPC , which oppose his criminal behavior , are an autocratic devil opposed to democracy and human rights , in a bid to stir up bad feeling between the Taiwan compatriots and the mainland of the motherland and pin on it the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan strait and for a possible war .  
An official in Beijing responsible for work on Taiwan pointed out that in his administrative report , Taiwan 's " premier " Tang Fei did not touch on the question of one China and instead indulged in empty talk about establishing a mechanism of mutual trust between the militaries of the two sides , about holding all-round dialogues , and about reviewing the policy on direct trade , postal and transportation links across the strait , adding that he was being unrealistic .  
The relevant official said that direct three links between both sides of the strait , small-scale three links , and direct sea and air links - - an issue raised by Chen Shui-bian - - involve too wide a range of problems that Taiwan can not resolve singly .  In addition , the CPC 's current attitude is that if Taiwan does not return to the " one-China " principle , nothing can be discussed .  Therefore now is not the time to raise the aforesaid issue .  
However , through the sudden change in the world history , the Taiwan authorities only caught sight of splittism and the " strategically favorable chance " of " creating another China . " As a result , the dregs under the Taiwan Strait were floating and the evil wind was blowing over the strait , thus turning the destiny of one China into a political magic and turning the ever-improving cross-strait relations since 1992 into ones " without agreements . "  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
The trends described above indicate that the Taiwan authorities and the military are transforming a " passive defensive strategy " into an " active defensive strategy , " the core of which is to strengthen military " deterrence , " avoid as much as possible a decisive battle on the island , and make great efforts to push the battle ground off the island or even to the west of the center line of the strait or within the mainland .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
The extremist " Taiwan independence " forces are bound to end up badly battered in going against the tide of history by attempting to hoist the tattered banner of the so-called " provisional government of the republic of Taiwan , " calling back the soul of separatism , and attempting to challenge the Chinese people 's resolve and confidence to reunify the country ; they are also bound to be spurned by the Chinese people on both sides of the strait , and rejected by the international community .  
Fan Xizhou , Chen Kongli , Lin Jing , and Liu Guoshen , Taiwan issue experts of the Taiwan Affairs Research Institute of Xiamen University , today expressed their views on " mutual invitations by Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors for mutual visits . "  They said that mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors have positive significance on promoting the two cities ' economic and cultural exchanges and developing their relations .  People on both sides of the strait are optimistically looking forward to the success of their visits .  
Associate Professor Liu Guoshen said : Mutual visits between Xiamen and Kaohsiung mayors seem like the first light of the day in the current critical cross-strait relations .  These visits , serving as an opportunity for both sides of the strait to advance toward mutual trust and reconciliation , can not come true because of obstructions by the Taiwan side under " all sorts of pretexts . "  This is regrettable .  
The mainland 's Second Artillery Corps has also developed a whole series of missiles , including various types of missiles for various purposes , short-range and medium-range missiles , as well as intercontinental missiles ; quite a few of which have attained the advanced world standard .  Once an unexpected incident breaks out , the mainland forces will be able to cross the strait and launch a precision strike .  
Some of the experts said that since taking office , the new leader of the Taiwan authorities has continued to be evasive and ambiguous regarding the one China principle and has erected obstacles to the development of cross-strait relations , causing tension in the Taiwan strait ; the Taiwan people have very strong views opposing " Taiwan independence , " and everyone is worried that Taiwan will suffer devastating blows should war break out .  
If the Mainland continues to maintain its fast economic growth as that in the past 20 years and become the world 's largest economy with the greatest market potential in the next two decades as many authoritative international institutions have predicted , it will provide unlimited opportunities for businesses at home and abroad , especially for the businesses in Taiwan , which is only separated by a narrow strait .  This is an important guarantee for the motherland 's prosperity and reunification .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Making no mention whatsoever about the Taiwan authorities ' defeat in their internal struggles with the Mainland for the ruling power in China and in the external struggles for China 's representation , he simply characterizes the two sides of the strait as two independent sovereign countries since Taiwan was separated from the Mainland in 1949 .  
Lien Chan noted that the KMT already formed a sound mainland-work mechanism when it was a ruling party .  Under this mechanism , he said , the NUC has , since its establishment , carried out its functions of integrating the opinions of the majority of people , safeguarding Taiwan 's security , and stabilizing the situation in the Taiwan Strait . The organization can play an active and positive role in promoting constructive interaction between the two sides of the strait , he added .  
During an interview given to reporters from inside and outside the border , Xi Jinping said that the broad ranks of people in Taiwan had a strong desire for " three exchanges " across the strait some time ago .  Viewed from the current personnel , material , and other exchanges across the strait , Taiwan residents are the most frequent users .  
If war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , and sea transport is blockaded , foreign trade as a support for economic development will suffer serious setbacks , many industrial production departments will halt production and close down , and the entire economy will be facing tremendous blows .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
The military source said that the establishment of the Fuzhou Theater signifies the intensified degree of tension in the Taiwan strait compared with the previous stages and increased possibility of a breakout of a partial war by adding that the military had raised a level of military alert in this theater .  
After comparing the completely different prospects for the stock markets across the Taiwan strait , Kao Ching-yuan , chairman of Taiwan 's President Group , and Wang You-zen , chairman of Taiwan 's Libar group , pointed out in a clear-cut manner at a forum sponsored by the TAIEX and attended by heads of Taiwan 's listed companies that the free fall of Taiwan 's stock market was not due to the economic factors .  Wang You-zen was more direct , saying " human factor " was the cause of Taiwan 's stock market blue .  
Recently , to allow " information to be commonly shared " and enhance our three-dimensional penetrating ability in gathering information from across the strait , the Ministry of National Defense even merged the three services ' intelligence collection systems and streamlined the information transmission methods to enliven the armed forces ' coast-based systems of early warning , wartime command , observation , communication , search for carrier terminals , and reconnaissance , thus establishing a very careful entity as well as a mobile and flexible reconnaissance and communication system .  
During the meeting , Ye Xuanping gave a briefing on the achievements in reform and opening up of the motherland 's mainland as well as on the new social look of areas inhabited by the people of the Haka ethnic group .  He sincerely hoped compatriots on both sides of the strait will make great efforts to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese nation , take the culture of the Chinese nation as a link , promote consensus , communication and understanding , and make concerted efforts to promote the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
A cross-strait academic seminar on Dr . Sun Yat-sen was held here a few days ago .  Specialists and scholars from both sides of the strait pointed out that opposing a split and safeguarding national unification are important parts of Dr . Sun Yat-sen 's ideas and that reunification is the only choice of the Chinese on both sides of the strait .  
Finally , the SEF representative " suggested each side state position in verbal form within an acceptable scope for both sides " and put forward additional three oral expression plans .  The number eighth expression plan stated " in the process of both sides of the strait striving to seek the state 's reunification , both sides adhere to the one-China principle although they held different views on the meaning of and understanding of one-China . "  
Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] and others and extremist " Taiwan independence " elements on the island echo each other in dishing up absurd separatist theories such as the two sides of the strait are so-called " distant relatives but close neighbors , " " acknowledging one China means surrender , " and " not mentioning the two-state theory does not mean it does not exist . "  The " Independence Party " has also staged a farce of the " provisional government of the republic of Taiwan . "  
Leaders of the party and state have repeatedly reiterated sticking to the basic guideline of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " and President Jiang 's eight proposals , continued to vigorously develop cross-strait economic cooperation , pushed for direct " three links " across the strait at an early date , and welcomed visits by Taiwan parties , bodies , and people of all circles to exchange views and promote consensus on opposing together " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait ties , and promoting the process of peaceful reunification .  
Zhang Qisheng said : The rapid development of cross-strait exchanges has had a far-reaching impact on efforts by the compatriots on both sides of the strait to jointly carry forward the fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation .  It has deepened mutual understanding between compatriots on both sides of the strait and enhanced their sense of responsibility and mission regarding the reunification of the motherland .  
An Min pointed out : For a long time , Taiwan authorities have rejected direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait and adopted a series of obstructive and restrictive policies .  This is out of keeping with the basic demands of the people on both sides of the strait and the development of the situation , and has infringed upon the fundamental interests of the people on both shores , especially the Taiwan people .  This practice is increasingly unpopular .  
Thus , the " measures , " which were drawn up based on these principles , are bound to be warmly received by the industrial and business communities on both sides of the strait .  Moreover , they will benefit our Taiwanese compatriots in fully understanding the relevant regulations concerning trade with Taiwan and bolster confidence in cross-strait trade .  
In 1986 , our ministry announced management measures , and in 1993 our ministry in conjunction with the General Customs Administration promulgated the " Management Measures for Small-Volume Trade with the Taiwan Region . " Small-volume trade is conducted by approved small-volume trade companies under the supervision of Customs and is supplementary to the regular trade across the strait .  Its existence and development has advanced the understanding of the people on both sides of the strait and has played a positive role in encouraging direct trade across the strait .  
Qian Qichen said , back in 1979 , based on the objective requirements of cross-strait economic development and exchanges of various kinds , we proposed the establishment of direct postal , transport , and commercial links across the strait .  It is regrettable that this has not yet been realized due to the obstacles raised by the Taiwan authorities .  
David Shen , director of China Policy Program of Washington 's George Washington University , published an article in the latest issue of a bimonthly magazine : " Foreign Affairs .  In the article , he said : The " confederation " model is " the final and most hopeful " format for resolving cross-strait issues .  He urged the new Bush administration to make vigorous efforts to get both sides of the strait to resume talks so as to avoid the potential crisis that might arise from suspended cross-strait interactions .  
Shortly after the Taiwan authorities started their so-called " mini three links , " the Kuomintang and the New Party separately dispatched their " three links " delegations to visit Beijing and expressed their discontent at the Taiwan authorities ' dilatory and perfunctory practice toward the " three links . "  This also shows that only complete and direct " three links " can really satisfy the urgent needs of the people on both sides of the strait .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .  
Such perverse acts have led to Taiwan 's turbulent political situation , sluggish economy , tumbling stock prices , and unstable popular feelings .  As a result , not only is the political deadlock between the two sides of the strait unable to be broken , but some factors of uncertainty keeps on increasing .  
He stressed the need to further promote the development of cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges , promote the realization of direct " three links " between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date , and the need to seriously listen to the voice of Taiwan compatriots , increase exchanges with all political parties , organizations , and people in Taiwan who oppose division and support national reunification , and jointly make efforts to promote the development of cross-strait relations and realize the motherland 's complete reunification .  
As we enter the new century , faced with the trend of economic globalization and fierce competition , and faced with the progress of science and technology which is changing with each passing day , the compatriots on both sides of the strait should all the more link hands in cooperation to meet the challenges together and make both of them winners in mutual benefit in the economy and in science and technology .  
By uniting in endeavor , the compatriots of both sides of the strait will certainly be able to accomplish the great cause of the motherland 's reunification at an early date , and build our common home into a rich and strong , democratic , and civilized modern nation , thus writing a still more resplendent chapter in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
With the idea of " future one China " that appeared in Chen Shui-bian 's inauguration speech and the " political integration " proposal in his new year message , the mainland , which used to squint at him , has more or less opened their eyes .  The grim situation of confrontation across the strait since the second half of last year has changed or is making a change .  On the other hand , however , the deadlock has not been broken despite the ease of tension to some extent .  
An editorial in Taiwan 's Chung-Kuo Shih-Pao criticized Chen Shui-bian , at a time when the " three mini links " have just been established , exchanges between cities on the two sides of the strait have just begun , and the policy of " no haste , be patient " is being reviewed , for inviting Taiwan independence elements to Taiwan from outside the island and for chanting " Taiwan stands up " loud at the congress , damaging cross-strait relations and " destroying the general situation taking shape " .  
Members of the Legislative Yuan : This year is the fortieth anniversary of the fall of the mainland . Many of us still recall that time just after the government moved to Taiwan , when aid from the international community had been cut off , when everything on the bastion of national recovery was waiting to be done , when the Communists across the strait clamored to " wash Taiwan in blood , " when the storm raged for a time , and the situation was precarious .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
The main reasons for this are that with direct shipping most freight moving between the two sides will no longer need to be transshipped through Hong Kong . Scholars estimate that with direct shipping across the strait , the volume of cargo passing through Hong Kong will shrink by 1 million standard containers . Although this is less than one tenth of Hong Kong 's total volume , it will probably affect Hong Kong 's status as the world 's largest transshipment port .  
Naval forces : The PRC could use submarines and mobilize motorized fishing vessels to undertake an extended blockade of Taiwan . It could deploy mines in the waters surrounding Taiwan and outlying islands . Using its amphibious capability , it could land a reinforced division . Finally , motorized fishing boats could ferry as many as 350,000 well-equipped support troops across the strait should a beachhead be established in Taiwan .  
Moreover , with relations across the Taiwan Strait unstable and the two sides of the strait still seeking a mutually acceptable model for interaction , extreme positions calling for rapid reunification or independence are not beneficial to the vast majority of Taiwan 's people .  
After eight years of hard work laying the foundation for the company , artkey executive vice-president Ivan Fan surveys the current scene and gives her analysis . After mainland China joined the World Trade Organization , intellectual property on both sides of the strait benefited from increased international protection . At the same time , another " East Asia fever " is set to grip the world as we come up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
In fact , contrary to expectations based on previous studies , the deep drilling survey brought to light unexpected geological problems regarding the thickness of the Quaternary filling in the subsoil of the strait .  
The most noteworthy aspect of the results of the survey ( March 1999 ) is that , despite progress in operational terms , which resulted in a near doubling of the maximum penetration achieved in the previous survey , the geological substratum sought in certain critical areas in the central part of the strait has still not been detected .
