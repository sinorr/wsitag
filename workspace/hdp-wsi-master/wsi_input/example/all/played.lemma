The Taoist ideal of being one with nature , escaping the confines of daily life to a solitary existence among the forests and mountains has long played an important part in the general appreciation and popularity of traditional landscape painting .

The forgotten people of historyEventually the Japanese came to the view that overseas Chinese organizations posed too serious a threat .

A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .

She remembers that when the kids played soldiers in school , the losers would often be ridiculed as " Zhi Na [ Chinese ] troops , " indicating how inept they were .

According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour .

They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
He moves swiftly , rushing like the wind , though his chubby build makes him look a small mountain . His round face always wears a jovial look . This easygoing and vigorous personality contrasts sharply with the seriousness characteristic among most of the Buddhist teachers in Taiwan . In fact , Rinpoche even played a role in the movie Little Buddha , directed by the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci .  
Song people really played out their penchant for probing things ' inner nature . Not bothered with ordinary flowers Thus categorized by the people of the Song , not only was the plum flower judged the most virtuous of the " noble four " of the black plum , the orchid , the bamboo and the chrysanthemum-the names of its cousins the peach , the Japanese plum , the cherry and the almond were all blackened .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
In addition , a point that is particularly scorned is that the normally jovial program hosts look unnatural and out of place when doing these emotive segments . Variety shows still are played mainly for laughs and entertainment . Inserting these segments is a gimmick intended to add drama . The hosts , stuck between solemnity and silliness , often look embarrassed and uncertain what to do next .  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music .

She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s . Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet . The success of Wu Bai &amp; China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
Because the digital economy is the trend , and it affects all elements of national economic growth-investment behavior , productivity , human resources , currency policy , inflation-and these are things that businesses can not control ( or even understand ) , especially in this murky era when the rules of the game are unclear , the role played by the government is critical .  
Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .  
But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience .

The ROC government has been encouraging the growing of edible mushrooms since as far back as the immediate post-WWII period . Wufeng has played a leading role in the development of mushrooms as an economic crop in Taiwan , and has earned a considerable amount of foreign exchange in the process .  
Because , in the eyes of an ordinary person , their abilities border on pure magic . A painter uses a brush , a bit of ink , and a few colors to create a world beyond anything we could imagine .

Casual and easygoing in real life , she came to the studio dressed in a house robe and slippers , just like the character she played , which was down-home , offbeat and outspoken . Even though hers was only a supporting role , her natural , unaffected style of acting won over audiences and made the show a hit , boosting her career to new heights .  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
A : Naturally , reports on the dark side of specific cases are more newsworthy . For example , anytime we have a press conference , we always send notices to reporters three days in advance . But news about our seminar on a lobbying law and improper back-door influence got only a small amount of space in the papers , whereas the Feng An stock case was played up by the media for four days straight , from the time they got the notices to the press conference .  
The forgotten people of historyEventually the Japanese came to the view that overseas Chinese organizations posed too serious a threat . Since Kao could not be bought , they played their trump card , forcing him to sell the transit company he ran with relatives . At the same time , the police were assigned to monitor his every move , investigating and questioning anyone he associated with . And so they cut both his access to money and his social network .  
Because the two main characters of Pushing Hands were played by two very experienced senior actors and this was the first time Lee was directing , he was " shy of stepping on their toes and was n't comfortable telling them what to do . "  
A splendid photo opThe most plentiful species was the Japanese White-eye ; between 20 and 30 of them played in the tree . They self-assuredly pecked fruit , heads held high or dipped low , not even frightened away by the sound of a car door opening and closing under the tree or the rumble of an engine .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
In the films , Bruce Lee played such roles as a student in a martial arts training school in one of the foreign concessions in the early years of the Republic of China , or a lonely Chinese expatriate going to Southeast Asia or the West to try and make a living . Faced with inevitable bullying and insults from Westerners and Japanese , he would endure their repeated taunts , suppressing his anger until he could yield no further and all his pent-up ire would burst out .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
They tore down the Matsu Temple , which was the center of religious life in Taipei , and built Kodama Goto Memorial Hall ( honoring the fourth Governor-General Kodama Gentaro and Senior Minister Goto Shinpei ) . Western classical music was played on the hall 's open-air stage all day long . All sorts of celebrations were also held here , as was the incomparably famous World Expo .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
Li Hsiu , a Tainan native now in her late 50 ' s , still remembers that she watched films like these in primary school . " Everyone admired the heroism and courage of the Japanese soldiers , " she admits . They were also deeply impressed with the idea that the Chinese side was militarily incompetent . She remembers that when the kids played soldiers in school , the losers would often be ridiculed as " Zhi Na [ Chinese ] troops , " indicating how inept they were .  
Here 's something that makes for an interesting comparison : In the 1992 legislative elections , Chou Chuan , then still a member of the KMT , did n't obtain her party 's nomination , and she decided to run as an independent . According to Chou , there was a virtual media blackout about her campaign , until a cable system operator within her district took the initiative to broadcast a videotape of her describing her political views . Outsiders thus concluded that cable television played a great part in her election .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
They took on roles both ancient and modern , Chinese and Western . At one moment they played the roles of shepherd boys , wearing traditional Chinese clothing and Buddhist rosaries . At the next moment they wore the trendiest of plastic apparel . Then they posed holding the classical instruments that are their specialties-the violin and the cello .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Ancient texts give us a glimpse of the many different occasions when such music was played . For instance , Shan Hai Jing ( The Classic of Mountains and Seas ) describes how the Yellow Emperor used the skin of a kui ( a legendary beast ) for a drum : " He struck it with the bones of the thunder-beast . The sound was heard 500 leagues , and terrified the whole world . " This is probably the earliest recorded example in Chinese history of the use of a war drum .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
He moves swiftly , rushing like the wind , though his chubby build makes him look a small mountain . His round face always wears a jovial look . This easygoing and vigorous personality contrasts sharply with the seriousness characteristic among most of the Buddhist teachers in Taiwan . In fact , Rinpoche even played a role in the movie Little Buddha , directed by the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci .  
Song people really played out their penchant for probing things ' inner nature . Not bothered with ordinary flowers Thus categorized by the people of the Song , not only was the plum flower judged the most virtuous of the " noble four " of the black plum , the orchid , the bamboo and the chrysanthemum-the names of its cousins the peach , the Japanese plum , the cherry and the almond were all blackened .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
In addition , a point that is particularly scorned is that the normally jovial program hosts look unnatural and out of place when doing these emotive segments . Variety shows still are played mainly for laughs and entertainment . Inserting these segments is a gimmick intended to add drama . The hosts , stuck between solemnity and silliness , often look embarrassed and uncertain what to do next .  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music . Before entering medical school she played piano for three years and practiced the violin for four . She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s . Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet . The success of Wu Bai &amp; China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .  
Chang Shiang-hua , who played a leading role in the translation of these poems , points out : " No matter how much difference there may be in political , military , or economic values , no matter how much competition or even conflict there maybe , basic human nature can still in many respects be recorded in poetry , and convey the beauty and the purity of heart .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera .

Because the digital economy is the trend , and it affects all elements of national economic growth-investment behavior , productivity , human resources , currency policy , inflation-and these are things that businesses can not control ( or even understand ) , especially in this murky era when the rules of the game are unclear , the role played by the government is critical .  
Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .

Wufeng is the leading producer of these in Taiwan , with more than 40 growers cultivating a large range of varieties including the enoki ( or enokitake ) , of which Wufeng is one of the world 's leading sources .

Wufeng has played a leading role in the development of mushrooms as an economic crop in Taiwan , and has earned a considerable amount of foreign exchange in the process .  
Because , in the eyes of an ordinary person , their abilities border on pure magic . A painter uses a brush , a bit of ink , and a few colors to create a world beyond anything we could imagine .

Lin Pen-hsuan , assistant professor at the Institute of Sociology at Nanhua University , reminds us that in this extremely commercialized world , people have moved from viewing the body as taboo , then opening up to an acceptance of it , to seeing that it can be manipulated and played around with .
