My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
A world free of colonialism , foreign occupation and aggression , and protected from the threat of racial hegemony , expansionism or colonization is the necessary precursor of a world free of poverty , injustice and oppression , in which relations are more democratic , humane , secure and stable for the well-being of one and all .  
The application of unilateral measures that ignore the growing negative opinion of the international community can not constitute a solid foundation for a peaceful and secure coexistence , ruled by law .  
The items permanently on the Council 's agenda are so numerous and so important that it would be expedient for it to advise the Assembly on everything that , one way or another , might affect international peace and security ; on cases in which sanctions or other coercive measures are applied ; on the establishment , fulfilment or change of mandate of peacekeeping operations ; or on all other actions where the Security Council itself would do well to secure a broad international consensus .  
In both Declarations , the international community recognized that no State has the right to intervene , directly or indirectly , for any reason whatever , in the internal or external affairs of any other State , and that no State may use or encourage the use of economic , political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights or to secure from it advantages of any kind .  
Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
FATTAH ( Egypt ) said that , in view of the major responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in recent years and the increased attention it was giving to social and economic matters , the Organization had a proportionately greater need to secure the support of world public opinion through the invaluable role currently played by the information media .  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
We are convinced that only a substantial improvement in the social and economic situation in a situation of national reconciliation can create the right conditions for a democratic , stable and secure Haiti to develop .  
The United Nations Mission in Haiti ( UNMIH ) has done a commendable job in assisting the Haitian authorities in sustaining a secure and stable environment , in organizing successful municipal and legislative elections and , above all , in managing the smooth transition from one democratically elected president to another no mean feat , given the tortured political history of Haiti .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more . 
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
Holders of TFRK will need to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the partnerships ; convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
The intensive agronomic technology that has allowed steady increases in world food production , based on high-yielding varieties coupled with the application of fertilizers and effective means of pest control , is largely dependent on irrigation to secure and control soil moisture in the face of insufficient and unreliable rainfall .  
To secure a reasonable standard of living for the farming community especially through raising personal income for people employed in agriculture ;  
As already noted , the reduction of UNMIH 's military element necessitated a concentration of the remaining forces in Port-au-Prince ( see attached map ) , which , as the centre of economic , political and social activity in Haiti , is critical to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment .  
I should also like to reiterate my firm conviction that the continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors is contingent upon the existence of a secure environment maintained by a credible international military force ( see S / 1995 / 1031 , para .  29 ) .  
Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with all countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty , contributing to a cleaner global environment and living conditions , enhancement of confidence and strengthening of international security , aimed at a more secure and healthy world .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
By 1973 the time had come to codify these various instruments in a single convention , Convention No . 138 concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment , which is general in scope and obliges States to pursue a national policy designed to secure the effective abolition of child labour and progressively to raise the minimum age for admission to employment to a level enabling young people to attain the fullest possible physical and mental development . 
Similarly , the High Commissioner has assertively sought to secure that economic , social and cultural rights , and particularly the right to development , acquire a higher profile within the framework of United Nations human rights efforts , in the spirit of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which proclaimed that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated . 
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;  
According to numerous non-governmental observers , the authorities had usurped the religious sphere , claiming that they alone were in possession of divine truth , and had perverted religion by politically exploiting Islam in order to secure their grip on power and enforce their authority through religious and political persecution and totalitarian methods , in complete contrast to the historically tolerant Muslim heritage of the Sudan .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The extension of the UNSMIH mandate is necessary to complete the professionalization of the Haitian police and to continue motivating its performance in Port-au-Prince and the rest of the country , and thus to be able to create the secure and stable environment needed by the people and Government of Haiti in order to promote national reconciliation , strengthen the administration of justice , consolidate the democratic system and stimulate the country 's economic and social development .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , NFPs or other relevant policy frameworks , as long-term iterative processes , should be based on [ guiding principles recognizing ] the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership ; consistency with national policies and international commitments ; integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies ; partnership and participation ; [ and ] holistic and intersectoral approaches that recognize forests as diverse ecosystems ; and secure land and property rights . 7 bis .  
This finding was based on an extensive discussion of Mali 's recent history , led and informed by two Ministers from that country who described their Government 's determination to involve all segments of the population in the peace process , to recognize the specific development needs of the north , to reintegrate former combatants into civil society , to help resettle refugees and to provide a secure environment conducive to disarmament .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
Mr . Yakovlev ( Russian Federation ) ( interpretation from Russian ) : The purposes set out in the statutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) to unite parliamentarians to secure the broad participation of States in the strengthening of international peace and security , in the firm establishment of representative institutions and in the defence of human rights are largely consonant with the aspirations of the United Nations .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
The vital contribution of the multinational Stabilization Force in providing a secure environment for the implementation of the Peace Agreement has been generally recognized , and it is particularly important that the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference confirmed an emerging consensus on the need for an international military presence to continue beyond June 1998 . 
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
In actual fact the authorities were combating the development of a militant Sikh terrorist movement campaigning for a separate and autonomous Sikh state , which had first appeared in 1978 ; it was financed by the Sikh diaspora ( and even by Pakistan ) and was using religion to secure the support of Sikhs and as an easy means of whipping up their passions in favour of a purely political cause .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
By means of resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 28 March , the Council authorized a number of Member States to establish a multinational protection force of a temporary and limited nature to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Eleven countries , under the leadership of Italy , declared their readiness to send a total of up to 7,200 troops to form a multinational protection force with the mission of facilitating the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and of helping create the secure environment needed for the missions of international organizations in Albania , to provide humanitarian assistance and to help in monitoring elections .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
On the understanding that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people are addressed , the Assembly also stresses the need to strengthen coordination with those departments , agencies and bodies responsible for development activities , in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for development .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
As the peace implementation process in Bosnia and Herzegovina enters its most critical stage , it is imperative that the relatively safe and secure environment created by the presence of the multinational force be maintained and further consolidated to ensure that all the efforts and resources invested so far will bear the desired results .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Welcomes the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance ;  
Welcomes the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance ;  
On 28 March 1997 , the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , by which it authorized the establishment of a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate in a neutral and impartial way the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;

In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance , and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance . 
Because multilateral funding is declining and there is a tendency to become more dependent on directed multilateral contributions , WFP is intensifying its efforts to secure resources at the field level by ensuring that donor representatives are well informed of WFP activities and by broadening its donor base for the long term .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
More generally , ACC members called for complementary actions by the United Nations system , in close partnership with other actors , to support country-level efforts at relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , and agreed upon the broad elements of a common strategic framework for response to , and recovery from , crisis , as part of the system 's overall effort to help secure durable peace and pursue or restore sustainable development in countries in crisis situations .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
It is my firm belief that for the time being there could be no civil implementation without the strong international military force available immediately to ensure the secure environment , which is also mandatory for the work of the civilian organizations .

The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
Enterprise development , productive investment and expanded access to open and dynamic markets in the context of an open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system [ , and to technologies for all people , especially those living in poverty and the disadvantaged , as well as for the least developed countries ] ;  
We are convinced that only a substantial improvement in the social and economic situation in a situation of national reconciliation can create the right conditions for a democratic , stable and secure Haiti to develop .  
The United Nations Mission in Haiti ( UNMIH ) has done a commendable job in assisting the Haitian authorities in sustaining a secure and stable environment , in organizing successful municipal and legislative elections and , above all , in managing the smooth transition from one democratically elected president to another no mean feat , given the tortured political history of Haiti .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more . 
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
For the underprivileged of the world , there is greater awareness of the situation in the developed countries , resulting in raised aspirations and calls in global forums for goals and standards regarding increased prosperity , a secure and healthy life , human rights , social justice and gender equality . 
Decisions on arrangements for consultation should be guided by the principle that consultative arrangements are to be made , on the one hand , for the purpose of enabling the Council or one of its bodies to secure expert information or advice from organizations having special competence in the subjects for which consultative arrangements are made , and , on the other hand , to enable international , regional , subregional and national organizations which represent important elements of public opinion to express their views .

Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
Holders of TFRK will need to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the partnerships ; convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
The intensive agronomic technology that has allowed steady increases in world food production , based on high-yielding varieties coupled with the application of fertilizers and effective means of pest control , is largely dependent on irrigation to secure and control soil moisture in the face of insufficient and unreliable rainfall .  
To secure a reasonable standard of living for the farming community especially through raising personal income for people employed in agriculture ;  
As already noted , the reduction of UNMIH 's military element necessitated a concentration of the remaining forces in Port-au-Prince ( see attached map ) , which , as the centre of economic , political and social activity in Haiti , is critical to the maintenance of a secure and stable environment .  
I should also like to reiterate my firm conviction that the continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors is contingent upon the existence of a secure environment maintained by a credible international military force ( see S / 1995 / 1031 , para .  29 ) .  
Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate with all countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty , contributing to a cleaner global environment and living conditions , enhancement of confidence and strengthening of international security , aimed at a more secure and healthy world .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
By 1973 the time had come to codify these various instruments in a single convention , Convention No . 138 concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment , which is general in scope and obliges States to pursue a national policy designed to secure the effective abolition of child labour and progressively to raise the minimum age for admission to employment to a level enabling young people to attain the fullest possible physical and mental development . 
Similarly , the High Commissioner has assertively sought to secure that economic , social and cultural rights , and particularly the right to development , acquire a higher profile within the framework of United Nations human rights efforts , in the spirit of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which proclaimed that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated . 
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;

According to numerous non-governmental observers , the authorities had usurped the religious sphere , claiming that they alone were in possession of divine truth , and had perverted religion by politically exploiting Islam in order to secure their grip on power and enforce their authority through religious and political persecution and totalitarian methods , in complete contrast to the historically tolerant Muslim heritage of the Sudan .  
The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The extension of the UNSMIH mandate is necessary to complete the professionalization of the Haitian police and to continue motivating its performance in Port-au-Prince and the rest of the country , and thus to be able to create the secure and stable environment needed by the people and Government of Haiti in order to promote national reconciliation , strengthen the administration of justice , consolidate the democratic system and stimulate the country 's economic and social development .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , NFPs or other relevant policy frameworks , as long-term iterative processes , should be based on [ guiding principles recognizing ] the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership ; consistency with national policies and international commitments ; integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies ; partnership and participation ; [ and ] holistic and intersectoral approaches that recognize forests as diverse ecosystems ; and secure land and property rights . 7 bis .  
This finding was based on an extensive discussion of Mali 's recent history , led and informed by two Ministers from that country who described their Government 's determination to involve all segments of the population in the peace process , to recognize the specific development needs of the north , to reintegrate former combatants into civil society , to help resettle refugees and to provide a secure environment conducive to disarmament .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
Mr . Yakovlev ( Russian Federation ) ( interpretation from Russian ) : The purposes set out in the statutes of the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) to unite parliamentarians to secure the broad participation of States in the strengthening of international peace and security , in the firm establishment of representative institutions and in the defence of human rights are largely consonant with the aspirations of the United Nations .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
In so doing , our country has managed to preserve peace and social accord in its society , to remove contradictions that might have developed into bloody conflicts on ethnic , political and economic grounds and , as a result , to secure national harmony .  
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
The vital contribution of the multinational Stabilization Force in providing a secure environment for the implementation of the Peace Agreement has been generally recognized , and it is particularly important that the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference confirmed an emerging consensus on the need for an international military presence to continue beyond June 1998 . 
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
In addition to the poverty in which Venezuela 's population was living , the Committee was extremely concerned at the absence of any practical plans at the grass-roots level for putting forward women 's demands , and at the fact that it was difficult to secure passage of legislative proposals for meeting women 's needs .  
In actual fact the authorities were combating the development of a militant Sikh terrorist movement campaigning for a separate and autonomous Sikh state , which had first appeared in 1978 ; it was financed by the Sikh diaspora ( and even by Pakistan ) and was using religion to secure the support of Sikhs and as an easy means of whipping up their passions in favour of a purely political cause .  
It is united by shared organizational values and managerial principles that foster effective teamwork , high standards and managerial and individual responsibility and clear norms of staff conduct ; is secure in the justness of its accountability framework and in the provisions for staff empowerment , recognition and sanctions which that framework actively guarantees .  45 .  It has improved leadership styles and has established among all staff a strong culture of efficiency and professionalism .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
Holders of TFRK will need to be represented by their own representatives ; to feel secure in their land tenure arrangements ; to be reassured that they have been accorded status equal to that of the other members of the agreements ; and to be convinced of a common purpose compatible with their cultural and ecological values .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .  Thus a notable improvement in the situation in the country was brought about in a short period of time , restoring confidence in national prospects .  
By means of resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 28 March , the Council authorized a number of Member States to establish a multinational protection force of a temporary and limited nature to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Eleven countries , under the leadership of Italy , declared their readiness to send a total of up to 7,200 troops to form a multinational protection force with the mission of facilitating the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and of helping create the secure environment needed for the missions of international organizations in Albania , to provide humanitarian assistance and to help in monitoring elections .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
In situations where political mediation , peacekeeping efforts and humanitarian relief are carried out simultaneously , the special representative of the Secretary-General helps secure a cohesive overall approach by ensuring that activities are mutually reinforcing and that the respective tasks to be performed are clearly defined .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
Planning was carried out on the assumption that the mandate of the force , whether a multinational force or a peacekeeping operation , would be to secure the airport and ensure its functioning as a neutral zone ; to assist in the maintenance and consolidation of a ceasefire ; to create conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance ; and to facilitate political reconciliation leading to the creation of an environment conducive to a peaceful settlement of the conflict through the conduct of elections .  
As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme to secure representation of the major legal systems and to ensure balance among various geographical regions .  
On the understanding that action to secure global peace , security and stability will be futile unless the economic and social needs of people are addressed , the Assembly also stresses the need to strengthen coordination with those departments , agencies and bodies responsible for development activities , in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for development .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Urges the Secretary-General to ensure the effective functioning of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) in line with paragraph 232 of the Habitat Agenda so as to enable it to discharge its mandate fully and to serve as an efficient secretariat to the Commission , and also to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are drawn so as to facilitate the implementation of the follow-up to Habitat II and secure close cooperation at the secretariat level among all United Nations entities involved in the follow-up ;  
As the peace implementation process in Bosnia and Herzegovina enters its most critical stage , it is imperative that the relatively safe and secure environment created by the presence of the multinational force be maintained and further consolidated to ensure that all the efforts and resources invested so far will bear the desired results .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
In the face of the impact of globalization on inequality among countries due to differential access to global trade and capital markets , it is essential that policies be pursued by the international community to foster a more secure and equitable global environment and to prevent the emergence of a fractured world order . 
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .

The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
It calls upon all States to take prompt and effective measures , both on the national and on the international level , to remove all obstacles to the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to promote all actions that will secure the enjoyment of the said rights .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .

No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
It is my firm belief that for the time being there could be no civil implementation without the strong international military force available immediately to ensure the secure environment , which is also mandatory for the work of the civilian organizations .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
While the latter issue affects any participating individual and community , indigenous populations arguably have minimal access to the legal advice and political power necessary to secure an outcome satisfactory to them .  
A fundamental prerequisite for transparency would be the application of consistent and strict standards of accounting and secure handling and storage procedures for fissile material at the national level .  
It also recommended adopting the 20 / 20 concept of mutual commitment for basic social programmes , providing youth with a secure and healthy future , and supporting efforts for capacity-building for human development .  
Energy plays a key role in achieving the economic , social and environmental objective of sustainable development , and the supply of energy must be secure and reliable .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;

Indeed , in struggling for a just cause , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to defend itself , not only at the military level ( through the exercise of individual or collective self-defence ) but also at the judicial level ( through an application to the International Court of Justice ) in order to secure the condemnation of the aggressors and just compensation for the damage suffered , including the damage described in this white paper .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
Recalling the importance of regional stability and the need to consolidate the progress achieved so far , and in particular to assist the people of the Central African Republic to consolidate the process of national reconciliation taking into account the need to maintain a secure and stable environment conducive to the economic recovery and to the holding of free and fair presidential elections ,
