Not only was this unlike the European way of making embankments out of square slabs , but there would even be small islands in the lakes joined by crooked bridges leading to pavilions .  
Vargas says that damage to the environment has awakened the consciousness of Costa Ricans , and there is a consensus to protect nature . In 1990 , after the government established a ministry for natural resources and the environment ( whose Spanish acronym is MINAE ) , 50,000 square kilometers of land-a full quarter of all remaining forest-was made into ten protected areas , and 24 national parks . More than 700 conservation officers do wildlife surveys and park protection on a full-time basis ( please see the accompanying article ) .  
The Overseas Affairs Commission established the Chinese Culture Center on two acres of land , and it is the most expansive such center in the world . Apart from five classrooms , it also has separate rooms for badminton and ping-pong and a dance room of more than 3500 square feet . The mere sight of it fills new and prospective members with great expectations , making them eager to give the seniors ' association activities a try .  
Yang San-lang 's father , Yang Chung-tso , was a famous poet of that era , and this was the " Wang Creek Villa , " whose grounds covered 180,000 square feet . When the chrysanthemums were in bloom , members of the social elite would gather here . Both in terms of artistic atmosphere and privilege , Yang San-lang clearly enjoyed more favorable circumstances and a more fertile environment than other artists of his era .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
This center covers over 10,000 square meters . It is spacious and transport is convenient . It is said that during Tseng Kuang-shun 's time as director of Taiwan 's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee the property was acquired through the efforts of two center directors . Cheng Hsin-pen made initial arrangements and Liang Po-chien signed the contract to complete the deal .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
Perhaps even more surprising would have been the sight of numbers of women , some bearing offerings on the way to the Buddhist temple , some peddling medicine , some running little restaurants . It does n't quite square with the familiar image of the ladies of that era as delicate little creatures , tottering about on their " three-inch golden lilies " ( bound feet ) and never stepping beyond the confines of the house .  
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei . Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields . It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .  
The Republic of Palau , situated on an archipelago in the Micronesia region of the South Pacific , occupies a strategic position both for international transport and in military terms . It has a total area of 488 square kilometers and a population of something over 18,000 . After being " discovered " by the Portuguese in 1783 , Palau was subsequently ruled by Spain and Germany . After WWI it was made a Japanese protectorate , and after WWII was governed by the US under a UN trusteeship .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
On May 20 , President Chen was officially sworn in at a ceremony carried out inside the Presidential Palace . Afterwards he went outside to deliver his inaugural address to a waiting audience in the square in front of the Presidential Palace , at which point he repeated the pose that he had assumed while taking the oath . The president did not salute anyone , and I would like to assure Mr . Lin that his gesture did not have any Nazi implications . We beg Mr . Lin 's understanding regarding this issue .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

Pinglin is located on the Taipei-Ilan Highway , 38 km east of Taipei , and 42 km west of Ilan . The area , covering 171 square kilometres , is mostly mountainous , with the Fushih Mountains to the north , the Ayu Mountains to the south , and the Peishih River meandering through it . Most of the population of more than 6000 is concentrated here in the river 's small floodplain .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
The words " If You Catch Me , Report Me " in large characters , along with the distinctive shape of the whale shark with its broad , flattened head , square snout , and large , wide mouth , make for an eye-catching sight amid the blue and gray hues of a busy port .  
Its design is based on the idea of an eastward-facing traditional Taiwanese sanheyuan farmhouse ( which has a square courtyard that is open on one side and enclosed on three by the main hall and its two wings ) . The school has a simple layout , with its classrooms connected by corridors . Doorways are constructed out of decorative cinderblocks and banisters out of stainless steel molded into plant motifs and matched with wooden railings . Outer walls are decorated with round , square , rectangular and cloud-shaped openings .  
With a mere 80 or 85 square meters of floor space , design and decorating were handled entirely by Huang and his wife , who put in a wooden floor and displayed English bone china . One might generously call the location " slightly off the beaten track , " but frankly speaking , it was pretty much out in the sticks .  
When you enter the building , the fragrance of java wafts across from the coffee shop on the first floor . The four levels downstairs constitute the digital learning center , which was opened for use only in September . The architect Lin Chou-min , who designed the immensely successful Eslite bookstore chain , was brought in to lay out the learning center . The more than 1000 square meter space includes a wireless Internet zone , a multimedia production area , small audiovisual conference rooms , and a corner theater .  
It occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters , and cost NT $ 380 million to build . The idea for its design came from the historical vicissitudes of the archeological discoveries , and from the first peoples who crossed the sea in boats to come to Taiwan . The museum is built in three disparate architectural styles , representing the connection between mountains and sea , between past and present . The arched steel-framed structure symbolizes the sea , with the structural layout employing outward radiating lines to indicate the ocean .  
Besides these there were also pinch-mouthed and wide-rimmed basins , often decorated from the neck down with various design motifs that vary greatly , although square criss-cross patterns and slanting criss-cross patterns predominate . In addition , there are a few impressed circles and dotted designs . Usually such ornamentation is found on the exterior surface and above the lips of the pots .  
Buildings were built out over the sidewalks , buttressed by square beams or curved arches , with businesses downstairs and residences upstairs . This is the most characteristic architectural form shared by all of Taiwan 's cities and towns , north and south .  
" What 's original with me is that after folding the wing into a very normal flat shape , I improved the structure by further folding the wings into triangle shapes that attached to the middle of the fuselage . Finally , there is the square fold of a stabilizer wing beneath the fuselage . That was the most difficult part .  
located to the east of tian'anmen square , the museum of chinese history is the first national museum in china with exhibition halls of 8,000 square meters besides the regular exhibition of chinese comprehensive history , special exhibitions on various subjects are often held at the museum

At this very moment , millions of children are dying of hunger , at a time when hundreds of millions of square kilometres of fertile land lie unexploited or underexploited as a result , among other things , of the prevailing economic conditions , inequitable international trading relations and the crushing debt burden .  
Increased public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure , including irrigation and drainage , rural energy , transport and markets will be required ; in this connection , a long-term plan should be developed to reclaim the 10-million square kilometres in Africa lost to tsetse fly infestation .  
On the basis of an average space requirement of 7 square metres per person ( the minimum space allocation in accordance with established standard scales of issue ) , it is estimated that 150 prefabricated modules ( housing two persons each ) and 10 composite ablution units , each based on a 20-foot size configuration , would be required . 
It was decided that the general definition of certification authority should be based on the text of paragraph ( 3 ) of draft article B . It was agreed that the reference to natural and legal persons should be complemented by a reference to electronic devices , which should be placed between square brackets , pending future consideration by the Working Group .  
His Government had worked tirelessly to set aside almost 1-million square kilometres - more than a tenth of the national territory - for the 330,000 indigenous people living in Brazil , a process that had required the adoption of special legislation to ensure its constitutionality . 
While no one can yet accurately estimate the total number of items at large or which areas are contaminated , historic estimates have assumed 3-million anti-personnel landmines , and recent government estimates suggest that as much as 13,000 square kilometres ( a quarter of the land surface of Croatia ) , are being treated as suspected mined areas . 
The AG13 , having considered a proposal from the Chairman , decided to adopt the framework of the multilateral consultative process , set out in annex II below , subject to the matters contained in square brackets in its paragraphs 8 and 9 .

Even though we continue to be collectively and individually committed to finding a comprehensive solution that would make the Security Council more representative , effective and transparent , delegations are also getting exhausted and drained by the repetitiveness of the debate , as we run around in circles trying to square major differences .  
It would be possible for Equatorial Guinea to ensure , within a reasonably short period , the full realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights for the 450,000 inhabitants living in its territory of 28,000 square kilometres .  
It was also agreed that , in view of the concerns expressed about whether the draft convention should include private international law rules dealing with priority issues with respect to types of asset that were not receivables and about which the appropriate applicable law should be , and the issues identified for further refinement , the proposed text should be retained within square brackets .  
Furthermore , it was agreed that , in order to provide an alternative presentation of the matters covered in paragraph 1 whereby paragraph 1 ( a ) would deal with priority in respect of receivables and paragraph 1 ( b ) would deal with priority in proceeds , paragraph 1 ( a ) ( ii ) should be moved to paragraph 1 ( b ) and be placed within separate square brackets , pending determination by the Commission of the placement of that provision .  
Before entering into a discussion of the provisions of chapter V , the Working Group considered the general usefulness of chapter V and its scope as reflected in draft article 1 , paragraph 4 , which appeared within square brackets pending final determination of the scope or the purpose of chapter V .
