With such result and not least the tremendous effect by a very competent local staff , there is no doubt we took the right decision to set up our regional base in Hong Kong and we will continue to expand here in the coming future . " 
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
In comparison with the United States , we are a society that has changed relatively more dramatically . Since retrocession , economic growth pulled by the locomotive of exports , universal education and the transformation of social and family structures have all caused a tremendous change in Taiwan 's industry .

Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult .

In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center .

Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure .

There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan .

Hence , although TCM is seen as having tremendous potential as a source from which to develop new drugs to treat cancer , in clinical practice in Taiwan it is assigned to the auxiliary role of alleviating the side effects of cancer therapies , assisting post-operative recovery and promoting general good health , in particular by preventive means . This role is consistent with the consensus among TCM practitioners and doctors qualified in both traditions on how Chinese and Western medicine should be used together to combat cancer .

Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two .

Chen 's rise to the top of his craft has hardly been so meteoric . His swords are completed slowly , at the cost of tremendous sweat .  
Chen made full use of tin 's flexibility to contrast the cock 's soft feathers , its obstinate and unruly beak , and its two erect legs .

Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
The situation is quite different in mainland China , where it is common for writers-both the famous and the unheralded-to have the same piece published some dozen times in publications large and small around the country . Relative to the cost of living , the writing fees there are quite ample , and writers who produce enough work should definitely be able to make a living off their writing . Under the circumstances , the publishing industry has tremendous potential and should move in the direction of the European and American models .

With such result and not least the tremendous effect by a very competent local staff , there is no doubt we took the right decision to set up our regional base in Hong Kong and we will continue to expand here in the coming future . " 
Though progress has been made in heavy industry , and nuclear weapons have been produced , India 's grassroots social construction work lags far behind . Most of the people are poverty-stricken , and disparity in the distribution of wealth between rich and poor is tremendous . When floods and droughts occur , many die of hunger . " What uses are such highly educated people to their country if they live in exile ? "  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
In comparison with the United States , we are a society that has changed relatively more dramatically . Since retrocession , economic growth pulled by the locomotive of exports , universal education and the transformation of social and family structures have all caused a tremendous change in Taiwan 's industry . Relatively speaking . The populous generation born after the war did not have the obvious impact it did in America .  
More than half the members of the current Diet are Waseda alumni , and the school has turned out four prime ministers , including Noboru Takeshita and Toshiki Kaifu . The Waseda " old school tie " network helps its own and wields tremendous clout .

Parents feel under tremendous pressure .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult .

The characters of traditional operas - - the emperors , generals , ministers and talented men and beautiful women - - were substituted with the heros of the proletariat - - workers , peasants and soldiers - - who were all inhumanly flawless " models " of virtue .

In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era .

Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes .

Hence , although TCM is seen as having tremendous potential as a source from which to develop new drugs to treat cancer , in clinical practice in Taiwan it is assigned to the auxiliary role of alleviating the side effects of cancer therapies , assisting post-operative recovery and promoting general good health , in particular by preventive means . This role is consistent with the consensus among TCM practitioners and doctors qualified in both traditions on how Chinese and Western medicine should be used together to combat cancer .  
" If it had n't been for the Formosa Plastics mercury waste incident in Cambodia , who knows how long the chaos in Taiwan 's management , storage and disposal of hazardous industrial wastes would have continued , along with the tremendous threat it poses to human health and the environment ?

Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two .

Chen 's rise to the top of his craft has hardly been so meteoric . His swords are completed slowly , at the cost of tremendous sweat .  
Chen made full use of tin 's flexibility to contrast the cock 's soft feathers , its obstinate and unruly beak , and its two erect legs . Thousand Mile Eyes and Ears that Hear with the Wind , which is part of the collection at Tachia 's Chenlan Temple , depicts the two deities that are sidekicks of Mazu , the goddess of the sea . It blends various techniques in a work of great spirit and vitality . The deities ' magnificent poses and strong muscular lines reinforce each other to achieve tremendous drama and realism .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ?

Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
The situation is quite different in mainland China , where it is common for writers-both the famous and the unheralded-to have the same piece published some dozen times in publications large and small around the country . Relative to the cost of living , the writing fees there are quite ample , and writers who produce enough work should definitely be able to make a living off their writing . Under the circumstances , the publishing industry has tremendous potential and should move in the direction of the European and American models .  
The completion of National Highway No . 3 bears witness to tremendous changes in Taiwan .
