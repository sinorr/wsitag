In that age when medical care was scarce , it was often impossible to do anything for people infected by disease . In addition , workers in the mines often faced unpredictable dangers , and there was periodic havoc wrought by fire or flood .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
With regard to this , some scholars early on suggested that medical histories , being a precious medical resource and crucial to human life , should be transferred along with the person , and should not be locked within the hospital . Ideal as this suggestion may sound , medical centers maintain the hesitant mentality of " if personal medical history is really opened up , wo n't there be endless medical controversies ? "  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Although not a father myself , I can still imagine the excitement , anxiety and even fear which the prospect of a first child 's arrival arouses in parents-to-be , so to some extent I was mentally prepared . But when on the evening of 6 April last year I hurried to the delivery room at National Taiwan University Hospital , I found it hard to associate the Lina I saw lying helplessly on a bed , her belly covered with the tubes and wires of medical instruments , with her usual everyday self .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
Not only in the realm of medical care , but also in the laboratory and in clinical research , researchers are investigating traditional medicines in the hope of striking gold . Their ambition is to find more effective ways to deal with the many hard-to-treat illnesses which currently afflict human beings . The more optimistic among them predict that integration of TCM and Western medicine will become part of the mainstream of medical care in the 21st century .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports . It focuses on the search for individual problems and is not widely applicable general research . " Only a very few projects can really be said to have been designed as clinical trials . And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
" Even people with just a little bit of medical knowledge know that many chronic congenital illnesses and conditions can be prevented or controlled through diet and a healthy life-style , " says Dr . Shieh . He says that among the factors linked to cardiovascular disease , one of the principal causes of death on Taiwan , are obesity and lack of exercise . As a result , while doctors treat it with medication , they also recommend the patient change his eating habits and get appropriate exercise .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music . Before entering medical school she played piano for three years and practiced the violin for four . She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
Other medical works also refer , by a variety of names , to various cancers such as gastric , esophageal , intestinal and bone cancer . Their descriptions of the symptoms are almost identical to the observations of modern anatomical medicine .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
From the traditional Taiwanese perspective , medicine is the most elevated of professions , and many important Taiwanese families have pursued careers in this field . In the past , the medical community , the native Taiwanese elite and the opposition were held to be nearly synonymous . Now , this association has been shattered by Chang Chau-hsiung . It is no wonder that some in the DPP have described him as a " traitor . "  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died . The sadness of that occasion , along with worry about the future , triggered a relapse of her thyroid cancer . She received medical parole and soon thereafter applied to go abroad .  
" Palliative care , " or " natural death , " as it is often referred to , means that in accordance with a patient 's expressed free will , medical staff will refrain from using cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , artificial respirators , heart stimulants and other invasive medical technologies to prolong the dying process of patients with untreatable conditions .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
And after all the speeches from these international " super salesmen " of technology , the conference closed out with remarks by William Magee , founder of Operation Smile , a volunteer medical organization . This brought technology back to its ultimate purpose-human values . It was a truly meaningful and skillful conclusion to the event .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
To date , the DCB has acquired four new technologies with medical applications , including a platform to generate human monoclonal antibodies against entrovirus type 71 , and drugs with the potential to treat complications resulting from chronic heart failure and diabetes . The center is also beginning to get its hands on very promising technologies used to modify genes and proteins . It 's who you know  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
For example , " amniotic fluid embolism " is a dangerous obstetric emergency that can occur without any prior warning or symptoms , and may cause the sudden death of a mother during or after labor . Kao Tien-fu , a director of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the ROC and convener of its medical disputes committee , has encountered two cases , and sadly was unable to save either of the women .  
Our school has many famous doctors . One example is Qiu Maoliang , aged 90 , who was China 's greatest living acupuncturist , but sadly he passed away just recently . Others include ENT specialist Gan Zuwang , as well as Shen Jize , who teaches a course on the third-century medical textbook Synopsys of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber . His approach of combining ancient TCM texts with practical clinical examples makes the ancient books interesting and accessible .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
According to the laws governing national health insurance , every five years a new set of rates should be calculated to cover the following five years . In addition , whenever the system 's reserve fund goes below the equivalent of medical costs for one month ( currently , that figure is about NT $ 250 billion ) , then the insurance rates can be raised automatically .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
On the same day as the medical team arrived in Vietnam , to devote as much time as possible to treating patients , in the afternoon they immediately " opened for business . " By prior arrangement , the HCM Orthodontic Hospital had spread the news of their impending arrival far and wide , and there were already 50 or 60 children with oral clefts waiting for treatment , having been brought by their anxious but hopeful parents .  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
It was for these human rights and medical goals that the international community established the WHO . So when over 190 countries around the world fall under the protective umbrella of WHO , yet the 23 million people of Taiwan are excluded , this is not only unfair to Taiwan , it also represents a weakness in the overall global healthcare structure .  
Getting the injured quickly to medical treatment was the only bright spot in an otherwise tragic day . The accident was caused by simple human error , but some point out that the railway is underfunded and disaster could have struck in other ways . Each year there are 800,000 visitors to the Alishan Forest Recreation Area , which is under the auspices of the Taiwan Forestry Bureau , and every holiday the area is packed with visitors .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
During this fourth clinic of Tzu Chi 's held on Batam , altogether 901 patients were helped by the combined efforts of more than 150 Tzu Chi volunteers and 61 doctors from the medical association , as well as 9 local doctors and 52 local volunteers . In addition , more than a dozen volunteers from other Chinese Buddhist organizations also joined in or helped in transporting patients from offshore islands .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong . With the epidemic continuing to spread , and major medical centers themselves being taken out of action by the illness , how can we get back on a stable footing as quickly as possible ?  
There have also been numerous cases that have been reported only after the patient has died . Even more worrisome is that Taiwan 's leading medical institution-National Taiwan University Hospital-confirmed after a long period of rumors that there had been hospital transmission . About 250 medical personnel ( 10% of the staff ) were placed under quarantine , and the emergency room was closed for two weeks for intensive disinfection .  
During the early stages of the epidemic in Hong Kong , it was said that " three health professionals go down for every patient cured . " But now there are virtually zero transmissions among caregivers in that city . In contrast , Taiwan still lacks enough protective suits , masks , and portable oxygen tanks , with the result being that many health care workers are resigning to protect themselves . It appears that Taiwan has not given sufficient attention to training its medical professionals for epidemics , or to protecting them in the event .  
Moreover , various specialized medical centers that formerly carried the ball for epidemic illnesses-such as the hospitals dedicated to tuberculosis , leprosy , and even sexually transmitted diseases-have been compelled by market forces to close or restructure . Though the general hospitals that have replaced them have state-of-the-art facilities , they do not have an adequate number of negative pressure isolation rooms with independent climate control .  
Thus by the second half of the twentieth century , thanks to an apparently invincible medical science , humanity seemed to have become the absolute master of the natural world . So much so , that it began to let down its guard against viral disease-until 1981 .  
Taiwan has well-trained medical personnel and excellent facilities , but because it was not able to get advice and practical support from the WHO in a timely manner-for example , on preventing hospital transmission and implementing in-hospital prevention measures-much energy has been misspent and the holes created by mistakes have yet to be plugged . Vietnam , in contrast , has far fewer resources of its own compared to Taiwan , but received a great deal of WHO help and was able to rapidly control the spread of the virus .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
Helen studied at the Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology but did not graduate , or go on to serve in the medical field . Instead she became involved in sales , and over the course of many years of fair and honest dealing she accumulated a large number of business connections , which serves as a resource for her work rescuing abandoned animals .  
While SARS was prevalent , the increase in stress and the resultant weakening of immune functions enabled TB to spread and develop into active cases easily . Victims who were afraid to go to hospitals to obtain medicine or who had no one to supervise the taking of medication may also have caused increases in the number the failed treatments and the incidence of drug-resistant bacterial strains . However , SARS did at least have one salutary effect-it called the medical profession 's attention to tuberculosis .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
Dai Jingzhang , medical director of the TCM Clinic , says that Germany has very stringent standards governing the inspection of Chinese herbal medicines . A great many medicinal herbs that have been tested and approved in Beijing fail to be approved in Germany . This poses the problem for the clinic that when different medicinal herbs have to be substituted , it can not be ruled out that the efficacy of the treatment will be diminished .  
As a result of last year 's SARS outbreak , checking temperatures became an important part of medical checkups , but this extra step also put the persons responsible for checking temperatures at risk . One student , whose girlfriend is a nurse , came up with an earring thermometer that can be directly clipped to the earlobe . If the body temperature of the individual exceeds 38 oC , the heat transmitted through a conductive metal insert in the thermometer causes mercury to expand , activating a warning light .  
Besides conducting , Lee also mingled with the musicians , playing some percussion here and there . His obvious delight showed not in the least that this is a very ill man who has been long under medical care . Once absorbed in the music , Lee Tai-hsiang even moved to center stage and in a playful voice sang a medley of some of his songs that are by now familiar to everyone , such as " Sunlit Highway , " " A Beautiful Mistake , " and " Let Me Sing You One of Our Songs . "  
The rapid advance of genetic research is giving substance to the medical world 's high hopes for the future . As the function and interactions of our 35,000 genes are analyzed and explained , genetic screening will facilitate effective disease prevention and drug treatment at every step of human development , from the embryonic stage to old age . The age of personalized medicine seems sure to arrive , with all the benefits it will bring .  
Because the number of samples used in Lin 's study was small , because the results of her estimates could not be verified , and because there were ethical misgivings concerning ethnic bias , the Department of Health turned down her offer to use 10,000 doses of a screening reagent manufactured by Mackay Memorial Hospital to test doctors and nurses who were treating SARS patients . Lin was frustrated and bewildered by this decision , because all she had wanted to do was to help reduce the dangers to which medical personnel were exposed .  
From Great Giving Hall , where the medical school is located , one can look west to the verdant Central Mountain Range , east to hanging gardens replete with flowers and trees , and north to Still Thoughts Hall , the spiritual symbol of the Tzu Chi Foundation .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
This tactic aroused the objections of large hospitals . The Association of Medical Centers released a statement asserting that practices such as referring patients with chronic illnesses to " strategically allied " district hospitals , or limiting the number of outpatients who can be seen by each doctor to 60 per session , have been adopted in an attempt to coordinate with national health care policy . They claim that the BNHI views the hospitals ' approach as a refusal to treat patients and therefore enforced strict penalties , unreasonably placing medical centers in a no-win situation .  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .

This research needs to be guided at all stages by users and from the perspective of gender , particularly the perspective of women , and should be carried out in strict conformity with internationally accepted legal , ethical , medical and scientific standards for biomedical research ;  
The Government of Cuba has made considerable efforts to mitigate the traumatic effects of the criminal blockade on the Cuban nation and has tried to ensure , with the limited resources available to the country , that food and medicines are equally distributed among the people and that the levels of medical care , education , security and social welfare are maintained .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .

More than 360 medical specialists and highly qualified instructors from universities and medical centres from around the world have been unable to come to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to treat patients with serious conditions , perform delicate surgical procedures in public hospitals , conduct examinations in the country 's medical schools at different times of the year , and participate in conferences , symposia and courses organized in the country .  NULLThe growing shortage of spare parts has resulted in a deterioration in the maintenance of modern medical equipment used in hospitals and medical centres .  
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In this regard , the Government of Belarus would like to refer to the intention previously expressed by the United Nations Secretariat of reviewing and approving at a forthcoming meeting of the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl the phases and modalities of action by the United Nations to encourage donors to extend generous and tangible assistance for the purpose of advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes capable of reviving the sustainable development of the three countries that suffered most as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
The hostages and prisoners of war held by the Armenians , many of whom are considered missing persons since they are being concealed from the ICRC , are forced to do heavy physical labour , subjected to beatings and torture , and the sick and wounded are denied basic medical assistance .

Against this background , the Belgian Government supported the establishment of specialized reception centres to provide social , psychological and medical assistance to the victims , as well as legal assistance within the framework of judicial proceedings begun against the guilty parties .  
Provision of legal , social , financial and material assistance to victims of trafficking ( physical and psychological rehabilitation , professional retraining , provision of shelter , lawyers , hot-line services , medical aid , assistance in contacts with the police , embassies , etc . ) as well as to their families ;  
Additional expenditures resulted from the higher than projected unit costs for rations ; troop rotation cost carried over from the prior period ; helicopter hire charges that exceeded projected costs ; higher than estimated costs for audit services ; increased demand for medical services coupled with a rapid rise in cost of medical treatment ; and longer than anticipated costs for miscellaneous ground maintenance and facility services and repairs .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
It has built hospitals and medical centres to treat patients free of charge ; offered educational programmes for Afghan students ; trained Afghan medical groups ; implemented a comprehensive and continuous plan of child vaccination ; given necessary materials to orphanages ; and provided food and non-food assistance , often on a daily basis .  
It further noted that recent space technology spin-offs had resulted in products such as an anti-shock pressure suit for medical applications , a transportation guidance system , a hand-held electromagnetic probe for inspecting aircraft for cracks and other damage , an obstacle detection system to assist in automated operations , a prototype silicon detector of radiation-induced effects in humans , automated robotic gasoline pumps , force reflecting devices to assist the blind in using a computer mouse , nuclear waste facility clean-up , and field applications and demonstrations of tele-medicine systems ( " tele-clinics " ) .  
Specifically , this has included activities such as moving people to safe havens and providing assistance upon their arrival , arranging for medical treatment abroad for those wounded and unable to obtain it in situ , and facilitating third-country resettlement on either a temporary or permanent basis .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
Nevertheless , such regulation is included in separate legal texts concerning particular areas of public life where protection of personal data is needed , notably internal affairs , citizenship and personal status issues , medical care and , to a certain extent , the execution of penal sanctions .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;

R &amp; amp ; D involving ICTs is yielding applications in areas such as integrated resource management , coordinated medical centres , environmental research and land management , biodiversity monitoring , biochemical engineering and molecular medicine , solar water heating and other energy conservation applications , and laboratory-based testing and standardization .  
One reason is the objective differences in the curricula offered by different countries / institutions , while another is the resistance of health professional associations to opening the domestic markets to students who have studied abroad , especially when there is no shortage of medical personnel trained in local schools .  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .

This consists of consolidating the activities of associations working with the elderly , strengthening work in the specialized medical and paramedical areas , validating the role of older people by benefiting from their experience and knowledge and providing permanent assistance to 3 , 100 vulnerable older people in the context of the national programme for the protection of older people .  
We are stressing the need to foster participation by and partnership between the young and the elderly in projects of national scope ; decentralizing specialized services in greatest demand in order to make them more accessible ; and creating geriatric units staffed by medical teams and multidisciplinary specialized personnel able to develop out-patient and hospital care , to name just a few measures .  
Nonetheless , the urgent appeal made by the Social Summit for emergency measures to address the very serious problems of poverty , unemployment , illiteracy and lack of basic medical care , among others which were , and continue to be , responsible for the increasing social marginalization in third-world societies was received with resolute hope .

While it is evident that there is a continued need for the international community to support the strengthening of national and local capacities in terms of health _ care expertise , infrastructure and supplies , it is also incumbent upon the national and local authorities to do their part to ensure that what is in principle free access to State _ sponsored medical services actually exists in practice .  
In the interim , the tragic plight of the internally displaced must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner , with particular attention being paid to ensuring that their most basic needs for food , shelter , clothing and medical services are met .  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .

The main thrust of the article was that the daily routine of Buddhist scholars , especially as regards their dietary habits , closely correlated with the medical causes of gallstone formation , while numerous points of similarity had been noted between the outward appearances of saris and gallstones .  
After he completed his military service in 1966 , he got a job as a medical photographer at a U . S . Navy research institute in Taipei . During his twelve years there , he learned many photographic and developing techniques . In his free time he traveled around shooting pictures of people and places he found interesting , and he also got to know Teng Nan-kuang , whose influence resulted in a greater breadth and freedom in his work .  
With rising environmental consciousness , there has been active support for the Orchid Island horned owl , the orchids , and other rare flora and fauna . But very few people have thought to look after the island 's Yami people , a national treasure , by offering them medical services . This has caused the island 's medical standards to be , like its geographic location , quite distant from Taiwan .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
As I practiced across Asia I also found that traditional treatments such as acupuncture , herbal remedies and tonic foods usually stemmed from Chinese herbal medicine , and so I thought of researching into Chineseme dicine . " In 1967 in New York Dr . Tsuei happened to meet the eminent herbal doctor Cheng Man-ch'ing , and began studying the Chinese medical work known as the Internal Classic with him . "  
Beyond this , strict medical tests have to be carried out before brain death can be confirmed . For example , under artificially aided respiration the patient must remain in deep coma for 12 hours without making any independent or involuntary movement . Further tests are needed to verify the patient 's inability to breathe alone , and observe for signs of brain activity .  
For instance , it 's not easy to eat when the joints in your hand are stiff , so buying a special spoon will be of assistance to you and at the same time reduce the burden on your family , while not detracting from your self respect ; walking is a problem for old people , so buying a safety cane minimizes the chances of falling and breaking a bone , thus saving a considerable sum in medical expenses .  
Add to this that modern people are more carefree about heirs , and also that medical advances have decreased concerns about having children at a later age ; and moreover it is more and more popular for the divorced or widowed to seek a second spring - - all these things mean that age is already not a crucial factor in deciding on whether it is appropriate to marry .  
The schools of theology , law and medicine are extremely famous . A special feature is that all of them have theoretical research as their strong suit . For example , in the medical school , besides the general clinical training required at all medical schools , they also place extraordinary emphasis on research and every student must periodically present a report on his or her own special area of research .  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
To which pixyish little Wei-wei adds , " And do n't forget the money to fix my nose , too ! " Different motives : No one has a perfect face , and cosmetic surgery should be considered a normal medical procedure for people with congenital defects or functional disabilities such as a harelip , cleft palate , ingrown eyelashes , scars from an automobile accident and so forth .  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
For remote areas where treatment is not easily accessible , the hospital 's Departtment of Family Medicine works with volunteers to organize a roving medical team , which goes deep into poor remote areas to deliver free care to the people . Dr . Lai Yu-chia has just completed a half-year stint on the roving volunteer team .  
Seeking for strong potential : According to data from the Directorate-General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics , Executive Yuan , the proportion of over-65s in the Taiwan region will reach 7.1 percent next year , meaning that the ROC meets the United Nations definition for an elderly society . The future will inevitably bring an increase in rates of chronic disease , and transdermal patches can provide a more effective , simpler means of medical treatment . "  
In that age when medical care was scarce , it was often impossible to do anything for people infected by disease . In addition , workers in the mines often faced unpredictable dangers , and there was periodic havoc wrought by fire or flood .  
Professor Hsia Liang-chou of the Pingtung Polytechnic Institute , who has studied animal welfare in depth , explains that animal welfare is concerned not only for wild animals ; the hope is that people will understand that it is not true that any animal " can be used for medical experiments in laboratories , so it 's all right to butcher them any way one pleases ; " and that one should also consider the feelings , moods , and physical responses of the domestic fowl and animals which supply human beings with rich protein .  
The main motive why Master Hsiao Yun , who has worked as a university professor in the past , decided to found a university was to develop students " who will truly be able to use technology to improve the human condition . " Master Cheng Yan set up the Tzu Chi nursing and medical schools to upgrade medical resources in eastern Taiwan , and to cultivate " beneficent doctors " with a spirit of compassion in an effort to help solve the problem of young girls in eastern Taiwan who have neither education nor employment .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
The people complained that insurance premiums were too high . In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation . And in the past you could go directly to a hospital to see a doctor with a good reputation for something as simple as a cold ; now with the medical referral system , you ca n't get through the front door .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
But even though high-level medical technology ca n't be provided on location in these remote districts , where populations number in the hundreds , combined medical assistance should be sufficient , through telemedicine , mobile medical care , and public-sponsored rural physician visitation services , all of which have been carried out for many years , as well as the backup system of offshore military medical services .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
With regard to this , some scholars early on suggested that medical histories , being a precious medical resource and crucial to human life , should be transferred along with the person , and should not be locked within the hospital . Ideal as this suggestion may sound , medical centers maintain the hesitant mentality of " if personal medical history is really opened up , wo n't there be endless medical controversies ? "  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
Folk popular , doctor disdainedBecause the Taiwanese medical establishment now follows mainstream Western medicine , many doctors say that hypnosis is " a mysterious art that is impossible to understand and hard to make sense of . " They regard such folk practices as spells , charms to calm people shocked by ghosts , and the trances of jitongs , as just plain superstitious and ridiculous . And as for meditation , yoga and Zen contemplation , these they view as the realm of religion , completely distinct from the domain of science .  
Thus although the center has been running for over a year , the number attending has always stayed around 20 to 30 . Birds of passageThe old people who are most in need of daycare are those with restricted mobility or in poor health . But the shortage of medical and nursing staff in Taiwan , the high cost of providing such care and the fact that it is not covered by the National Health Insurance scheme mean that hospitals around the country have little inclination to set up daycare centers or residential nursing homes .  
For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival . " Apart from a neighborhood parade typical of a temple fair , fire jumping , and plays sponsored by people with the same surname , the temple also held a photography exhibit , a children 's painting competition , and free traditional Chinese medical consultations . The excitement went on for a whole month .  
A few years ago there was an incident which shook society . A Buddhist medical worker who could not bear to witness the suffering of the severely ill in their last stages and the hardships imposed on families for the long-term care of " human vegetables , " " played God " and let some of them die . He was discovered and prosecuted .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Since appearing in Taiwan last Novem-ber , the book A Great Revolution in the Brain World has hit the spot with modern people living with " diseases of civilization . " It uses a mix of accessible language and medical evidence to propose an approach to health and longevity . This book became especially hot after NHK did a TV documentary series based on it . Bookstores sold out their copies in a week .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Although not a father myself , I can still imagine the excitement , anxiety and even fear which the prospect of a first child 's arrival arouses in parents-to-be , so to some extent I was mentally prepared . But when on the evening of 6 April last year I hurried to the delivery room at National Taiwan University Hospital , I found it hard to associate the Lina I saw lying helplessly on a bed , her belly covered with the tubes and wires of medical instruments , with her usual everyday self .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system . The measures proposed included one under which NHI would only have paid for hospital stays , not minor illnesses , and another which would have required patients to pay the cost differential created when they go to a major hospital to treat a minor problem . However , neither of these proposals were accepted .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
With improved technology , doctors rely increasingly on machines , and are unwilling to make any judgments before tests are completed . One book called Why Things Bite Back tells the true story of a Stanford University medical student who had a stomach ailment for four weeks . He entered the university hospital , and underwent a series of painful tests , and was told that the problem was with his appendix . But a retired old doctor only had to hear his descriptions of his symptoms , and that veteran physician knew immediately what the problem was .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
For the whole global village to be improved into an enormous " aseptic chamber " is surely impossible , but what we can predict is that if humans do not change their attitudes towards the environment and nature , and if they continue to pay scant regard to safe practice in medical treatment and the use of drugs , new viruses and infectious diseases will never stop appearing .  
Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass . All have a certification system . What is infuriating to him is that there is no such certification system for psychological counselors , psychological testers or clinical psychologists . Because no legal standards or sanctions are stipulated , you ca n't go after Yu for practicing without a license .  
Two-spotted lymantriid moth caterpillars ' bodies are covered with fine , spiny hairs , and although the insecticide quickly killed the grubs , their death throes released the hairs from their bodies . The number of poisonous spines drifting in the air increased dramatically , and with the help of Hsinchu 's strong winds they got into the children 's respiratory tracts ; the children also came out in an unbearably itchy red rash . Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
If you can get them breathing and their hearts beating again , you 've always got a shot at saving them . " But the use of CPR , which was originally intended for saving lives in medical emergencies , has been commandeered by the extend-life-at-all-costs philosophy of the modern medical era . Whether or not their illnesses are curable , if patients can be made to live another day , another hour , or even another minute , all efforts are made to save them .  
Not only in the realm of medical care , but also in the laboratory and in clinical research , researchers are investigating traditional medicines in the hope of striking gold . Their ambition is to find more effective ways to deal with the many hard-to-treat illnesses which currently afflict human beings . The more optimistic among them predict that integration of TCM and Western medicine will become part of the mainstream of medical care in the 21st century .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
There have been several attempts to get around the problem of insufficient objectivity in the diagnostic methods . Dr . Julia Tsuei and Chung Chieh , the former head of the traditional medical center at Veteran 's Memorial Hospital , developed the " Qin Value Detector " based on the principles of acupuncture and the meridian system .  
Chou , whose primary area of research is clinical statistics , states that most of this research is limited to extractions and animal research in the Chinese medical laboratory , or consists of individual case reports . It focuses on the search for individual problems and is not widely applicable general research . " Only a very few projects can really be said to have been designed as clinical trials . And even in these cases , the design is still rough .  
Chung argues that at the current stage Chinese medicine can still not achieve true integration with Western medicine . It is still seen by Western medical professionals only as supplementary , as helping out where Western medicine has failed , or as a partial substitute . " Integration , properly understood , is not taking something from A to plug a hole in B , but is a complete melding together of the two traditions . " This will require great deal of effort in the next century .  
" Even people with just a little bit of medical knowledge know that many chronic congenital illnesses and conditions can be prevented or controlled through diet and a healthy life-style , " says Dr . Shieh . He says that among the factors linked to cardiovascular disease , one of the principal causes of death on Taiwan , are obesity and lack of exercise . As a result , while doctors treat it with medication , they also recommend the patient change his eating habits and get appropriate exercise .  
" Clinical practice has demonstrated that appropriate levels of hormone supplements , antioxidants and immune-system-boosting vitamins keep the body functioning optimally and naturally provide a youthful glow . It 's like regaining one 's youth , " says Dr . Wang , a former director of the surgical ward of Chang Gung Children 's Hospital . He states that in Europe geriatric medicine focused on controlling aging long ago developed into a full-fledged specialization providing full medical services , and that this field is now being introduced into Taiwan .  
Because students in New Zealand do not have such a heavy homework load , she has also rekindled her former interest in music . Before entering medical school she played piano for three years and practiced the violin for four . She now has an appreciation for music and has mastered the basic techniques of playing musical instruments .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
Other medical works also refer , by a variety of names , to various cancers such as gastric , esophageal , intestinal and bone cancer . Their descriptions of the symptoms are almost identical to the observations of modern anatomical medicine .  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Donations have come pouring in by the truckload-instant noodles , mineral water , crackers , sleeping bags , blankets-and medical personnel have also swarmed to the area , but a lack of coordination has resulted in an excess of personnel and materiel in some areas and a complete lack in others . When well-equipped international rescue operations arrived at the disaster area , the lack of information forced many of them to set out on their own in search of victims . In some cases , five or six different rescue groups converged on a single site .  
From the traditional Taiwanese perspective , medicine is the most elevated of professions , and many important Taiwanese families have pursued careers in this field . In the past , the medical community , the native Taiwanese elite and the opposition were held to be nearly synonymous . Now , this association has been shattered by Chang Chau-hsiung . It is no wonder that some in the DPP have described him as a " traitor . "  
While in prison she kept herself occupied by studying philosophy , writing novels , and doing embroidery , but it was a very bleak time . She was still in jail when her mother died . The sadness of that occasion , along with worry about the future , triggered a relapse of her thyroid cancer . She received medical parole and soon thereafter applied to go abroad .  
" Palliative care , " or " natural death , " as it is often referred to , means that in accordance with a patient 's expressed free will , medical staff will refrain from using cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , artificial respirators , heart stimulants and other invasive medical technologies to prolong the dying process of patients with untreatable conditions .  
To avoid people being denied the right to medical self-determination because they are unable to express their will , anyone over 20 years of age and of full capacity may make an " advance declaration " of their wishes ( also known as a " living will " ) , and may appoint a medical representative who is empowered to sign a consent form on their behalf if they are unable to express themselves .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
In his remarks , entitled " Information Technology Changing the Face of the World , " Dr . Magee described his own experience with technology . Relying on advanced remote medical care technology ( and help from the business community ) , he discovered that modern technology really can make humanitarian assistance more successful and more effective .  
And after all the speeches from these international " super salesmen " of technology , the conference closed out with remarks by William Magee , founder of Operation Smile , a volunteer medical organization . This brought technology back to its ultimate purpose-human values . It was a truly meaningful and skillful conclusion to the event .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
To date , the DCB has acquired four new technologies with medical applications , including a platform to generate human monoclonal antibodies against entrovirus type 71 , and drugs with the potential to treat complications resulting from chronic heart failure and diabetes . The center is also beginning to get its hands on very promising technologies used to modify genes and proteins . It 's who you know  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
For example , " amniotic fluid embolism " is a dangerous obstetric emergency that can occur without any prior warning or symptoms , and may cause the sudden death of a mother during or after labor . Kao Tien-fu , a director of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the ROC and convener of its medical disputes committee , has encountered two cases , and sadly was unable to save either of the women .  
Our school has many famous doctors . One example is Qiu Maoliang , aged 90 , who was China 's greatest living acupuncturist , but sadly he passed away just recently . Others include ENT specialist Gan Zuwang , as well as Shen Jize , who teaches a course on the third-century medical textbook Synopsys of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber . His approach of combining ancient TCM texts with practical clinical examples makes the ancient books interesting and accessible .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
At present , 76 US medical schools offer courses in alternative medicine . In the international academic community , bioenergetic medicine organizations are holding frequent symposia , to take the first steps toward putting the field on a sound scientific footing . They have also begun active dialogue with practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine . It looks as if the health authorities in Taiwan ought not to completely ignore alternative medicine .  
According to the laws governing national health insurance , every five years a new set of rates should be calculated to cover the following five years . In addition , whenever the system 's reserve fund goes below the equivalent of medical costs for one month ( currently , that figure is about NT $ 250 billion ) , then the insurance rates can be raised automatically .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
On the same day as the medical team arrived in Vietnam , to devote as much time as possible to treating patients , in the afternoon they immediately " opened for business . " By prior arrangement , the HCM Orthodontic Hospital had spread the news of their impending arrival far and wide , and there were already 50 or 60 children with oral clefts waiting for treatment , having been brought by their anxious but hopeful parents .  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Even more encouraging to Taiwan 's medical community is the public support voiced last May by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services , Tommy G . Thompson . At an address delivered to a luncheon meeting of the World Medical Association , he stated that promoting world health is a task that should transcend political boundaries , and while the US is aware that Taiwan 's entry into the WHO is a controversial issue , the US will not shrink from taking a public position on the matter .  
It was for these human rights and medical goals that the international community established the WHO . So when over 190 countries around the world fall under the protective umbrella of WHO , yet the 23 million people of Taiwan are excluded , this is not only unfair to Taiwan , it also represents a weakness in the overall global healthcare structure .  
Getting the injured quickly to medical treatment was the only bright spot in an otherwise tragic day . The accident was caused by simple human error , but some point out that the railway is underfunded and disaster could have struck in other ways . Each year there are 800,000 visitors to the Alishan Forest Recreation Area , which is under the auspices of the Taiwan Forestry Bureau , and every holiday the area is packed with visitors .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
During this fourth clinic of Tzu Chi 's held on Batam , altogether 901 patients were helped by the combined efforts of more than 150 Tzu Chi volunteers and 61 doctors from the medical association , as well as 9 local doctors and 52 local volunteers . In addition , more than a dozen volunteers from other Chinese Buddhist organizations also joined in or helped in transporting patients from offshore islands .  
As of May 23 , there were 538 probable SARS cases in Taiwan , and more than 60 deaths , making Taiwan the third worst affected country in the world after mainland China and Hong Kong . With the epidemic continuing to spread , and major medical centers themselves being taken out of action by the illness , how can we get back on a stable footing as quickly as possible ?  
There have also been numerous cases that have been reported only after the patient has died . Even more worrisome is that Taiwan 's leading medical institution-National Taiwan University Hospital-confirmed after a long period of rumors that there had been hospital transmission . About 250 medical personnel ( 10% of the staff ) were placed under quarantine , and the emergency room was closed for two weeks for intensive disinfection .  
During the early stages of the epidemic in Hong Kong , it was said that " three health professionals go down for every patient cured . " But now there are virtually zero transmissions among caregivers in that city . In contrast , Taiwan still lacks enough protective suits , masks , and portable oxygen tanks , with the result being that many health care workers are resigning to protect themselves . It appears that Taiwan has not given sufficient attention to training its medical professionals for epidemics , or to protecting them in the event .  
Moreover , various specialized medical centers that formerly carried the ball for epidemic illnesses-such as the hospitals dedicated to tuberculosis , leprosy , and even sexually transmitted diseases-have been compelled by market forces to close or restructure . Though the general hospitals that have replaced them have state-of-the-art facilities , they do not have an adequate number of negative pressure isolation rooms with independent climate control .  
Thus by the second half of the twentieth century , thanks to an apparently invincible medical science , humanity seemed to have become the absolute master of the natural world . So much so , that it began to let down its guard against viral disease-until 1981 .  
Taiwan has well-trained medical personnel and excellent facilities , but because it was not able to get advice and practical support from the WHO in a timely manner-for example , on preventing hospital transmission and implementing in-hospital prevention measures-much energy has been misspent and the holes created by mistakes have yet to be plugged . Vietnam , in contrast , has far fewer resources of its own compared to Taiwan , but received a great deal of WHO help and was able to rapidly control the spread of the virus .  
For Shi Jin-hua , who suffers from diabetes , 1980 marked the time he started taking insulin injections and regularly recording his blood-sugar level with a glucometer . In the two decades since then , he estimates that he has measured his own blood sugar level at least 40,000 times . Over the years , Shi has carefully stored the medical waste , so important to his continued physical health and control , in sealed plastic bags .  
Helen studied at the Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology but did not graduate , or go on to serve in the medical field . Instead she became involved in sales , and over the course of many years of fair and honest dealing she accumulated a large number of business connections , which serves as a resource for her work rescuing abandoned animals .  
While SARS was prevalent , the increase in stress and the resultant weakening of immune functions enabled TB to spread and develop into active cases easily . Victims who were afraid to go to hospitals to obtain medicine or who had no one to supervise the taking of medication may also have caused increases in the number the failed treatments and the incidence of drug-resistant bacterial strains . However , SARS did at least have one salutary effect-it called the medical profession 's attention to tuberculosis .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
Dai Jingzhang , medical director of the TCM Clinic , says that Germany has very stringent standards governing the inspection of Chinese herbal medicines . A great many medicinal herbs that have been tested and approved in Beijing fail to be approved in Germany . This poses the problem for the clinic that when different medicinal herbs have to be substituted , it can not be ruled out that the efficacy of the treatment will be diminished .  
As a result of last year 's SARS outbreak , checking temperatures became an important part of medical checkups , but this extra step also put the persons responsible for checking temperatures at risk . One student , whose girlfriend is a nurse , came up with an earring thermometer that can be directly clipped to the earlobe . If the body temperature of the individual exceeds 38 oC , the heat transmitted through a conductive metal insert in the thermometer causes mercury to expand , activating a warning light .  
Besides conducting , Lee also mingled with the musicians , playing some percussion here and there . His obvious delight showed not in the least that this is a very ill man who has been long under medical care . Once absorbed in the music , Lee Tai-hsiang even moved to center stage and in a playful voice sang a medley of some of his songs that are by now familiar to everyone , such as " Sunlit Highway , " " A Beautiful Mistake , " and " Let Me Sing You One of Our Songs . "  
The rapid advance of genetic research is giving substance to the medical world 's high hopes for the future . As the function and interactions of our 35,000 genes are analyzed and explained , genetic screening will facilitate effective disease prevention and drug treatment at every step of human development , from the embryonic stage to old age . The age of personalized medicine seems sure to arrive , with all the benefits it will bring .  
Because the number of samples used in Lin 's study was small , because the results of her estimates could not be verified , and because there were ethical misgivings concerning ethnic bias , the Department of Health turned down her offer to use 10,000 doses of a screening reagent manufactured by Mackay Memorial Hospital to test doctors and nurses who were treating SARS patients . Lin was frustrated and bewildered by this decision , because all she had wanted to do was to help reduce the dangers to which medical personnel were exposed .  
From Great Giving Hall , where the medical school is located , one can look west to the verdant Central Mountain Range , east to hanging gardens replete with flowers and trees , and north to Still Thoughts Hall , the spiritual symbol of the Tzu Chi Foundation .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
This tactic aroused the objections of large hospitals . The Association of Medical Centers released a statement asserting that practices such as referring patients with chronic illnesses to " strategically allied " district hospitals , or limiting the number of outpatients who can be seen by each doctor to 60 per session , have been adopted in an attempt to coordinate with national health care policy . They claim that the BNHI views the hospitals ' approach as a refusal to treat patients and therefore enforced strict penalties , unreasonably placing medical centers in a no-win situation .  
Looking to the future , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that NHI premiums will have to increase to ensure that hospitals can survive , the public can get needed medical care , and the NHI program itself can stay solvent . The caveat is that besides increasing revenues , restraining expenditures and eliminating waste are the only viable long-term options for saving the program , and the only means of achieving a satisfactory result for the government , the health care sector , and the public .

This research needs to be guided at all stages by users and from the perspective of gender , particularly the perspective of women , and should be carried out in strict conformity with internationally accepted legal , ethical , medical and scientific standards for biomedical research ;  
The Government of Cuba has made considerable efforts to mitigate the traumatic effects of the criminal blockade on the Cuban nation and has tried to ensure , with the limited resources available to the country , that food and medicines are equally distributed among the people and that the levels of medical care , education , security and social welfare are maintained .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .

Female employees assigned to work that is not allowed to be performed by pregnant women or to work that , in medical opinion , would threaten the pregnancy and for that reason are reassigned to other lower paid work during pregnancy until the ninth month after childbirth are allocated complementary pregnancy and maternity benefits , amounting to the difference between their average earnings before being reassigned to lower paid work , and those earned in the individual calendar months following such reassignment .  
Under chapter 150 , employers are forbidden to assign women to work in the underground mining of minerals or driving of tunnels and mining galleries , or to work that is physically unsuitable for or harmful to women mainly if it is potentially threatening to their maternal calling ; they are furthermore forbidden to assign pregnant women to work that , in medical opinion , threatens their pregnancy .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
Some 15,750 persons living in the Jamahiriya are suffering from serious medical conditions ( cardiovascular disease ; fractures of the spinal column and thorax ; fractured skulls ; chronic eye diseases ; detached retinas ; serious burns ; cancer and malignant tumours ) which require emergency treatment ( neurosurgery ; spinal marrow transplants ; kidney transplants ; corneal transplants ; fitting of prostheses ) .  
More than 360 medical specialists and highly qualified instructors from universities and medical centres from around the world have been unable to come to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to treat patients with serious conditions , perform delicate surgical procedures in public hospitals , conduct examinations in the country 's medical schools at different times of the year , and participate in conferences , symposia and courses organized in the country .  NULLThe growing shortage of spare parts has resulted in a deterioration in the maintenance of modern medical equipment used in hospitals and medical centres .  
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .  
In this regard , the Government of Belarus would like to refer to the intention previously expressed by the United Nations Secretariat of reviewing and approving at a forthcoming meeting of the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl the phases and modalities of action by the United Nations to encourage donors to extend generous and tangible assistance for the purpose of advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes capable of reviving the sustainable development of the three countries that suffered most as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
The hostages and prisoners of war held by the Armenians , many of whom are considered missing persons since they are being concealed from the ICRC , are forced to do heavy physical labour , subjected to beatings and torture , and the sick and wounded are denied basic medical assistance .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
I had specified , however , that this plan was being seriously jeopardized by the total economic embargo imposed against Burundi , and I had stressed the urgent need to lift this embargo to allow our country to participate in this important humanitarian operation in many ways , such as by making available the Bujumbura international airport , the hospitals and modern hotels of the capital , the social centres and other reception facilities , the road networks and , especially , hospital and medical personnel .

According to the Standard Professional Code for German Physicians , which underlies all individual professional codes in this respect , all physicians , prior to conducting any clinical trial on a human person or epidemiological research using personal data , must seek the advice of a medical ethics commission on the medical and legal issues involved .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Against this background , the Belgian Government supported the establishment of specialized reception centres to provide social , psychological and medical assistance to the victims , as well as legal assistance within the framework of judicial proceedings begun against the guilty parties .  
Provision of legal , social , financial and material assistance to victims of trafficking ( physical and psychological rehabilitation , professional retraining , provision of shelter , lawyers , hot-line services , medical aid , assistance in contacts with the police , embassies , etc . ) as well as to their families ;  
Additional expenditures resulted from the higher than projected unit costs for rations ; troop rotation cost carried over from the prior period ; helicopter hire charges that exceeded projected costs ; higher than estimated costs for audit services ; increased demand for medical services coupled with a rapid rise in cost of medical treatment ; and longer than anticipated costs for miscellaneous ground maintenance and facility services and repairs .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
It has built hospitals and medical centres to treat patients free of charge ; offered educational programmes for Afghan students ; trained Afghan medical groups ; implemented a comprehensive and continuous plan of child vaccination ; given necessary materials to orphanages ; and provided food and non-food assistance , often on a daily basis .  
It further noted that recent space technology spin-offs had resulted in products such as an anti-shock pressure suit for medical applications , a transportation guidance system , a hand-held electromagnetic probe for inspecting aircraft for cracks and other damage , an obstacle detection system to assist in automated operations , a prototype silicon detector of radiation-induced effects in humans , automated robotic gasoline pumps , force reflecting devices to assist the blind in using a computer mouse , nuclear waste facility clean-up , and field applications and demonstrations of tele-medicine systems ( " tele-clinics " ) .  
Specifically , this has included activities such as moving people to safe havens and providing assistance upon their arrival , arranging for medical treatment abroad for those wounded and unable to obtain it in situ , and facilitating third-country resettlement on either a temporary or permanent basis .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
PHR is a Boston-based non _ governmental organization of forensic anthropologists , archaeologists , pathologists and other health professionals that seeks to use medical and scientific knowledge to protect human rights and promote accountability for violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular by investigating mass graves to identify victims of extrajudicial executions .  
Nevertheless , such regulation is included in separate legal texts concerning particular areas of public life where protection of personal data is needed , notably internal affairs , citizenship and personal status issues , medical care and , to a certain extent , the execution of penal sanctions .  
Those events had a direct impact on humanitarian conditions , owing to the resultant imposition of increased restrictions on the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in northern Cyprus , stricter security measures and interruption of regular medical transport to the southern part of the island as well as loss of employment for Turkish Cypriots working in the southern part of Cyprus .  
Again expresses its special alarm at the policies of the Government of Iraq , which discriminate between regions and prevent the equitable enjoyment of basic foodstuffs and medical supplies , and calls upon Iraq , which has sole responsibility in this regard , to take steps to cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq ;  
Using all preventive , educational , medical and legal information available , such programmes should raise the awareness of youth of the negative consequences of drug abuse and should be tailored individually to target specific groups of potential young abusers ;  
R &amp; amp ; D involving ICTs is yielding applications in areas such as integrated resource management , coordinated medical centres , environmental research and land management , biodiversity monitoring , biochemical engineering and molecular medicine , solar water heating and other energy conservation applications , and laboratory-based testing and standardization .  
One reason is the objective differences in the curricula offered by different countries / institutions , while another is the resistance of health professional associations to opening the domestic markets to students who have studied abroad , especially when there is no shortage of medical personnel trained in local schools .  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
The high technical and professional standard of Cubas scientific work force , allied to the major achievements in the development of the chemical-pharmaceutical , biotechnological and medical equipment industries , is leading Cuba to concentrate its efforts and resources on programmes that generate export earnings , for which purpose we are working hard to find markets in which to expand our exports to the maximum .  
The Committee could not approve a request dated 24 September 1996 from Jordan for the Committee 's authorization of one or more regular weekly flights between Amman and Baghdad by Royal Jordanian Airlines in order to carry United Nations personnel and for humanitarian reasons , that is , to transport the sick and elderly to and from Baghdad , to provide means of transportation for pilgrims in their pilgrimage to Moslem shrines in Iraq , and to transport medical , pharmaceutical and food supplies from Jordan .  
While it appreciated the work being done by the United Nations to initiate and coordinate activities aimed at finding a solution to the Chernobyl problem , his Government was seriously concerned by the fact that , at a time when the closing of the Chernobyl nuclear power plan was being discussed , the search for a solution to the medical and environmental consequences of the disaster , for which Belarus was bearing the main burden , was being relegated to the background .  
Whenever health supplies received under resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are sold through private sector pharmacies , equitable distribution requires uniform and transparent pricing that is not excessive in comparison with fees levied in public pharmacies , valid medical prescription and guarantees that the use of private sector pharmacies does not unduly disadvantage those who can not afford to purchase the drugs they require .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
VIII . 168 .  With regard to the methodology for apportionment of medical costs , the Advisory Committee was informed that this provides for the share of each participating organization to be determined on the basis of statistics prepared by the Joint Medical Service on the actual usage of the Service by the different organizations broken down by items such as medical exams , x-rays and laboratory tests , vaccinations and nursing care and administrative work .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
After a staff member has taken periods of uncertified sick leave totalling seven working days within a calendar year , any further absence from duty within that year shall either be supported by a medical certificate as provided under subparagraph ( vi ) above , or may be charged to annual leave or treated as an unauthorized absence in accordance with rule 105.1 ( b ) ( ii ) ; Rule 106.3 , as amended , reads as follows :  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
The Workshop calls upon States to refrain from any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights instruments , in particular the rights of everyone to a standard of living adequate for their health and well _ being , including food and medical care , housing and the necessary social services .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of the laws against prostitution which are enforced against sex workers and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients is not effective as a public health measure .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The international community must act with energy to eradicate gross violations of human rights and humanitarian crises , which are major human tragedies and result in millions of refugees and internally displaced persons , starving children and adults , lack of medical care , and hopeless futures for thousands lost and sometimes forgotten in even the most developed countries .  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
The increasing number of the fabricated and unjustified blocks and holds it puts on and the objections it makes to many of the contracts submitted to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , particularly in recent times , have demonstrated that the United States administration is using that Committee as a tool to implement its irresponsible policy directed against Iraq , by , whenever it wishes , preventing the Committee from approving contracts for food and medical supplies .  
The charge for programme support costs for non-reimbursable loans is generally calculated on the basis of requirements for standard common services costs for a staff member at the P-3 / P-4 level , as follows : maintenance and rental of premises , utilities and office supplies ; maintenance of office automation equipment ; telecommunications ; secretarial and administrative support ( generally calculated at five personnel to one General Service staff ) ; and medical services .  
Experts identified various global trends in the sector such as increased demand for health care , the phenomenon of consumerism , relative shortage of health personnel in some developed countries , aging population requiring tailor-made products , information / technology revolution , increased mobility of consumers and service providers , and increasing medical costs and decreasing public health care budgets requiring containment of health care costs .  
The Committee commented on the discriminatory application of laws enforced against women prostitutes and not the men involved as traffickers , pimps and clients , and noted further that forced medical examinations of the women without similar attention to the male clients was not effective as a public health measure .  
The main objective of the round table , following-up on the interregional round table held in Toronto , Canada , in September 1996 , was to monitor the manner in which ethical medical directives protected human rights .  
Using all preventive , educational , medical and legal information available , such programmes should raise the awareness of youth of the negative consequences of drug abuse , and should be tailored individually to target specific groups of potential young abusers ;  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft are essential in providing support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , the transport of medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
Voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as medical , psychological , psychiatric , social , economic or legal assistance to the victims of torture and their relatives .  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
Incineration , mainly of medical waste and combustible hazardous materials , has been practised widely in the region , but , it has not generally been efficient because of poor maintenance of plants , manpower shortage and improper choice of facilities .  
At the national level , numerous charitable organizations and benevolent societies provided medical and material assistance to the poor and needy .  
The Government 's annual budget , however , contained no direct allocations to medical or pharmaceutical research , which was funded by various public and private agencies .  
The Labour Code ( art . 116 ) sets out penalties for illegal abortion , indicating that illegal abortion carried out by an individual with an advanced medical degree is punishable by a fine equivalent to 50 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage .  
Illegal abortion carried out by an individual who does not have an advanced medical degree is punishable by a fine equivalent to 150 to 200 times the minimum monthly wage .  
At the same time , higher and specialized secondary medical teaching institutions , both State-owned and private , are being certified and accredited by an ad hoc commission established by joint order of the Ministries of Health and Education .  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The programme highlights priority areas , such as improving the statutory framework for the social welfare of senior citizens , improving the pensions and social assistance systems , raising the quality and effectiveness of medical care and expanding the role of senior citizens in public life .  
The Committee is particularly concerned with the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
In the national programme on improving the status of women , specific objectives were put forward under the strategic thrust of bettering the scope and quality of reproductive health services , which include the following : to offer once every two years to all women preventive medical check-ups ; to make them healthier ; and to activate health advocacy , training , publicity , information dissemination and counselling for the general public .  
In that context , apart from increasing its annual contribution to UNRWA , Cyprus had in 1996 developed its own scheme of assistance to the Palestinians which included , inter alia , the construction of two medical centres in the West Bank , at a cost of $ 2.2-million , and a comprehensive programme of technical assistance and training for some 100 Palestinian officials , including follow-up visits by Cypriot experts to the autonomous areas .  
The services recognized by this Act are of three kinds : ( a ) financial , such as cash payments , pensions , etc . ; ( b ) in kind , such as prosthetic and orthopaedic appliances , medicines and mechanical aids ; and ( c ) services of an assistance nature , such as medical , dental , surgical services , tests , etc .  
The 1998 report and the 1998 interim report ( memorandum ) of the previous Special Rapporteur referred to alleged massacres and summary executions , to outbursts of ethnic violence and other violations of human rights ranging from the infliction of inhuman and degrading punishment to systematic gender discrimination , including denial to women of access to medical care and employment .  
Furthermore , pending the revision of paragraphs ( f ) and ( g ) of financial rule 110.19 as called for in General Assembly resolution 52 / 226 , paragraph 18 , he had issued a memorandum in April 1998 to ensure that the procurement of professional supplies , medicines , medical supplies , hospital or surgical supplies and prosthetic appliances were no longer exempt from competitive bidding .  
The cantons were required to provide victims with access to independent public or private counselling centres whose task it was to offer medical , psychological , social , material and legal support and to give information on victim assistance .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
During the period of the United Nations Security Council sanctions , it was very difficult , or even impossible , for FRY to import medicaments , raw materials for medicaments , medical supplies , instruments and their spare parts , materials for personal protection of workers , measuring instruments and their spare parts , various chemicals which are required for various analyses in health care and micro-climate tests of working conditions , scientific and technical books , etc .  
The republican Governments have adopted or are about to adopt specific programmes regarding : mother and child care ( the Decree on health care of women , children , schoolchildren and students , adopted by the Government of the Republic of Serbia in November 1995 ) , protection against infectious diseases and disorders and against cardiovascular diseases , preventive dental health care , medical supplies , protection against chronic renal diseases , etc .  
To ensure adequate and systematic training for professional groups working with and for children , inter alia specialized judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , social workers , medical doctors and teachers , and coordination between various governmental bodies involved in children 's rights ;  
To ensure adequate and systematic training for professional groups working with and for children , inter alia specialized judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , social workers , medical doctors and teachers , and coordination between various governmental bodies involved in children 's rights ;  
The initial configuration of the Missions aircraft fleet included two medium-utility helicopters required for logistical support and medical evacuation , one heavy passenger / cargo fixed-wing aircraft for supply / resupply tasking , including flights beyond the mission area and one light command and liaison fixed-wing aircraft also suited for medical and casualty evacuations to hospitals in neighbouring countries ( see A / 52 / 895 ) .  
Physical accessibility implies that adequate food must be accessible to everyone , including physically vulnerable individuals , such as infants and young children , elderly people , the physically disabled , the terminally ill and persons with persistent medical problems , including the mentally ill .  
In connection with the other 50 per cent , spare parts for existing medical equipment and new medical equipment have been imported , the importation of these items having been adversely affected by the unjust embargo imposed nearly nine years ago , given that they are to be regarded as integral to the diagnostic process . 
One of the major problems identified by the Mission was the blockade imposed by the federal authorities on humanitarian assistance entering Montenegro through the port of Bar or from Croatia ( e.g . a large convoy of humanitarian aid including medical supplies destined for internally displaced persons had been blocked by the federal authorities for 10 days inside Montenegro ) .  
Thanks to this law , the enforcement and development of a private medical-care system part of the national policy on the population 's medical care will pay special attention to women 's health , which is far more sensitive to social and economic changes and to political , cultural and psychological factors . 
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
Appeal to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture , if possible on a regular basis , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide ,  
The Committee is particularly concerned at the high and increasing incidence of drug and substance abuse among the youth ; the lack of legal provisions in relation to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the limited psycho _ social and medical programmes and services available in this regard .  
This provides for the gradual phasing in of an additional 140 military observers , the establishment of a second-line medical capability with 35 medical personnel and the expansion of the Observer Mission by 59 international civilian and 21 local staff as well as for the required logistical support .  
The Special Rapporteur has observed , in most cases , systematic selection of individual victims or groups of victims , based on what appears to be intelligence on their career or backgrounds : university professors , medical personnel , persons who replaced Albanian workers fired in 1991 / 92 , even elderly spouses of former minor politicians or business executives have been targeted . 
Services were provided in medical rehabilitation ; education ; training and retraining ; vocational assessment and guidance ; placement in employment in the open market , sheltered employment , self-employment and supported employment ; provision of technical aids ; removal of social and physical barriers ; provision of allowances ; and financial assistance to disabled persons for purchasing their own homes .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The General Conference urged Member States to share information with the Secretariat regarding diagnostic and corrective actions being planned or implemented by operating and regulatory organizations at their nuclear power plants , fuel cycle and / or medical facilities which use radioactive materials to make those facilities Year 2000 ready .  
The General Conference encouraged the Secretariat , within existing resources , to act as a clearing house and central point of contact for Member States to exchange information regarding diagnostic and remediation actions being taken at nuclear power plants , fuel cycle and / or medical facilities which use radioactive materials to make these facilities Year 2000 ready .  
While noting that the dimension of the IDP crisis in Colombia has turned into an overwhelming challenge for the Government , national and international participants profoundly lamented the IDP populations current situation of insufficient access to food , shelter , clothing and medical care and called upon the Government to expedite these basic services .  
The therapeutic sector must be strengthened , modernized and developed through the establishment of health institutions , provided with the requisite modern equipment and facilities and qualified medical staff , in all parts of the Syrian Arab Republic .  
The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the internship system have been developed and the Ministry awards 40 specialized medical diplomas after theoretical and practical training in accordance with the most up-to-date scientific syllabuses .  
Further urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
In its concern for a safe environment , the Council gave instructions for the creation of an effective mechanism to coordinate the action of ministries and other relevant agencies at the national level in each member State in taking proper measures to dispose of medical waste and process radioactive waste and also to coordinate the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste .  
At its eighteenth session ( 17-28 May 1999 ) , the Board of Trustees of the Fund had recommended that , for the period June 1999 to May 2000 , grants of approximately US $ 5.1-million ( A / 54 / 177 , para . 16 ) should be awarded to medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian and legal assistance programmes , which were approved in June 1999 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on behalf of the Secretary-General ( paras . 18 and 21 ) .  
In paragraph 8 of the Declaration , the Committee against Torture , the Board of Trustees of the Fund , the Special Rapporteur and the High Commissioner appealed to all Governments , organizations and individuals to contribute generously and , if possible , on a regular basis to the Fund , keeping in mind the increasing demand for medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide . 
In accordance with a guideline laid down by the Board of Trustees , the Fund as a rule only finances up to a third ( 33.33 per cent ) of any programme of assistance submitted to it and only finances those activities of an organization that are intended to provide the victims of torture with direct medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian or legal assistance ; it does not provide financial aid for other victims or other activities of the help organizations .  
Article 40 of the Military Service Act provides that any person who fails to present himself for the military service medical examination to determine his physical fitness and ascertain whether he is suffering from any contagious disease or disability that would preclude his enlistment for military service is liable to a fine ranging from 30 to 100 dinars .  
As soon as a list is drawn up , humanitarian items such as foodstuffs , pharmaceuticals and medical supplies , as well as basic or standard medical and agricultural equipment and educational items , will no longer be submitted to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for approval .  
Specialized services established in order to contribute to protecting human life included medical and civil defence services , as well as special legal mechanisms to ensure respect for the rules of humanitarian law .  
Georgia , as a democratic State guided by the principles of humanism and strictly adhering to its international commitments , could not deny grant of asylum to thousands of women , children and elderly people fleeing military operations , or deny medical assistance to the sick and seriously wounded . 
Voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as medical , psychological , psychiatric , social , economic or legal assistance to the victims of torture and their relatives .  
Among the activities promoted by local and regional authorities , labour unions and non-governmental organizations were international and national conferences on the issues associated with ageing , ranging from broad cultural and social debates to more focused discussions of the specific economic , medical and psychological concerns of the elderly .  
This consists of consolidating the activities of associations working with the elderly , strengthening work in the specialized medical and paramedical areas , validating the role of older people by benefiting from their experience and knowledge and providing permanent assistance to 3 , 100 vulnerable older people in the context of the national programme for the protection of older people .  
We are stressing the need to foster participation by and partnership between the young and the elderly in projects of national scope ; decentralizing specialized services in greatest demand in order to make them more accessible ; and creating geriatric units staffed by medical teams and multidisciplinary specialized personnel able to develop out-patient and hospital care , to name just a few measures .  
Nonetheless , the urgent appeal made by the Social Summit for emergency measures to address the very serious problems of poverty , unemployment , illiteracy and lack of basic medical care , among others which were , and continue to be , responsible for the increasing social marginalization in third-world societies was received with resolute hope . 
The Government of our Republic has consistently maintained a policy of providing jobs , free medical treatment and free education to all people , even amid serious temporary economic difficulties created by economic blockades of foreign forces and natural disasters which have recurred over a number of consecutive years .  
It is encouraging to note that the Agencys role in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy now covers areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial , medical and agricultural applications .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
Since the beginning of 1998 , the Serbian military and police forces had launched a military attack against the Albanian population which had left thousands of innocent victims , including pregnant women , children and elderly people.They had deliberately shelled Albanian villages , destroying one third of the houses and forcing more than 300 , 000 people to flee , and had brought about a catastrophic humanitarian situation , with people living in the open without shelter , food or medical assistance .  
Voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as medical , psychological , psychiatric , social , economic or legal assistance to the victims of torture and their relatives .  
Guiding Principle 18 relating to the right to an adequate standard of living provides that at a minimum , regardless of the circumstances , and without discrimination , competent authorities shall provide internally displaced persons with and ensure safe access to : essential food and potable water ; basic shelter and housing ; appropriate clothing ; and essential medical services and sanitation .  
While it is evident that there is a continued need for the international community to support the strengthening of national and local capacities in terms of health _ care expertise , infrastructure and supplies , it is also incumbent upon the national and local authorities to do their part to ensure that what is in principle free access to State _ sponsored medical services actually exists in practice .  
In the interim , the tragic plight of the internally displaced must be addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner , with particular attention being paid to ensuring that their most basic needs for food , shelter , clothing and medical services are met .  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
In absolute terms , the use of modern renewable energy technology has increased , particularly solar PV systems , enabling households in small remote villages to operate a few electric lights and small appliances , such as televisions and video cassette recorders , small medical refrigerators , telecommunication equipment and water pumps .  
Torture is one of the vilest acts to be perpetrated by human beings upon one another.The proceeds paid in to the Fund will contribute to projects providing medical , psychological , social , humanitarian and legal assistance to victims of torture and members of their families worldwide .  
Examinations of detainees by medical doctors selected by them should be given weight in any court proceedings ( relating to the detainees or to officials accused of torture or ill-treatment ) equivalent to that accorded to officially employed or selected doctors having comparable qualifications ; the police bringing a detainee to a medical examination should never be those involved in the arrest or questioning of the detainees or the investigation of the incident provoking the detention .  
A system permitting an independent body , consisting of respected members of the community , representatives of legal and medical professional organizations and persons nominated by human rights organizations , to visit and report publicly on any place of deprivation of liberty should be set up as soon as possible .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations and the media in publicity campaigns , with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
In order to achieve the objectives described therein , the plan of operations for the Observer Mission headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , calls for the phased deployment , as security conditions permit , of the authorized strength of 70 military observers , a 15 - person medical unit and 5 civilian police advisers supported by 50 international civilian and 48 local staff .  
During the budget period , owing to the poor road infrastructure and prevailing security situation , the MI-8 helicopter would be utilized for the transportation of UNOMSIL military and civilian personnel , logistical support and supply resupply tasking , as well as for casualty and medical evacuation , if required .  
The current conflict in the Congo has led to a deepening humanitarian crisis , exacerbated the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , impeded the delivery of critical food and medical assistance , and in general hampered international and domestic efforts towards development and democracy .  
In view of the inadequacy of available supplies of basic drugs and medical supplies , the Government of Iraq was requested , in a letter dated 12 October 1999 ( S 1999-1053 , annex I ) , to ensure that all measures were taken to procure and distribute all essential pharmaceuticals in a timely manner , especially given the favourable financial situation of the Programme .  
To involve , among others , public opinion leaders , educators , religious leaders , chiefs , traditional leaders , medical practitioners , womens health and family planning organizations , the arts and the media in publicity campaigns with a view to promoting a collective and individual awareness of the human rights of women and girls and of how harmful traditional or customary practices violate those rights ;  
Under the international conventions adopted by ILO and pursuant to national labour legislation , indigenous peoples are fully entitled to employment , free choice of employment , satisfactory conditions of employment , medical care and social security , without distinction or discrimination on grounds of race or identity .  
An honorary advisory commission on sexual and reproductive health has been formed ; among its other activities , it is studying and formulating standards on medical and ethical problems relating to assisted reproduction .  
The ageing of populations and the increase in the number of elderly throughout the world which are the results of medical , hygienic , scientific and educational achievements are phenomena of the late twentieth century .
