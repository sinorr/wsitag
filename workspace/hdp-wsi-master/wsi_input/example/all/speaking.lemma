To promote the spirit of arduous struggling and pursuing effectiveness , we should vigorously advocate a social trend of speaking the truth , doing solid work and pursuing effectiveness .

Some people , although knowing that someone did something wrong , pretend not to know anything and keep one eye closed .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations .

The Yamis are organized chiefly around " fishing groups . "

The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
In comparison with the United States , we are a society that has changed relatively more dramatically . Since retrocession , economic growth pulled by the locomotive of exports , universal education and the transformation of social and family structures have all caused a tremendous change in Taiwan 's industry .

On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held .

But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied .

As a result , under their joint direction , Hsinhua had just the right functional balance of boldness and reserve .

Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
Give future scholars opportunities to do research , " One enjoys an antique , generally speaking , by admiring fine workmanship , a well-reasoned structure , the luster and grain of beautiful wood . Is it of magnificent appearance , at once stately and full of energy ? Is the workmanship of its embellishments wise - - outstanding without overwhelming its basic shape ? Are its lines smooth and pleasing to the eye ?  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
When speaking of the photography process , Chen remarks that in the beginning she was extremely precise and painstaking about the style of photography , and she discussed it with the photo company 's service lady for a long time .

' " The results left her feeling disappointed .  
Although both have reasons for their beliefs , comparatively speaking the mainland 's syllabuses and textbooks contain much more of the ideology of the Communist Party and of socialism , " making it explicit that education must serve politics , " says Huang Cheng-chieh .

"  
One of his reasons for writing was to correct some misconceptions about Ming furniture , because " strictly speaking they [ the early foreign collectors ] were biased , for they neglected the fact that there is also a side to Ming furniture of fine carving and intricate decoration , which of course is quite different from the elaborate ornamentation of Qing dynasty palace-style furniture . "  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
" Generally speaking , based on the production process , dZi beads ought to count as a kind of " etched agate " [ agate to which alkaline metal has been applied and heated to create a surface for etching designs ] , " Chang Hung-shih explains .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
In fact , the various statements made by PRC officials at APEC were unsurprising . What was unexpected and regrettable was the lopsided bias toward mainland China displayed by New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon . At a joint ministerial press conference , he prevented ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang from speaking , while allowing PRC officials to answer in his place , and he prevented Taiwan reporters from speaking on several occasions .  
If the proper degree of focus is placed on each of these skills ( i.e . , a 70% focus at the elementary level on listening and speaking , with a gradually increasing emphasis thereafter on reading and writing as students advance through the higher grades ) , we can say good-bye to the problem of elementary students failing to find the groove in junior high due to a change in teaching methods .  
( Chang Chin-ju / tr . by Robert Taylor ) The APEC economic leaders ' meeting was concluded on 21 October . Regrettably , because Taiwan and this year 's host , mainland China , were unable to agree on Taiwan 's choice of representative , and because at a ministerial press conference prior to the leaders ' meeting PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan prevented ROC economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi from speaking , the ROC government decided to withdraw from the summit .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
With a mere 80 or 85 square meters of floor space , design and decorating were handled entirely by Huang and his wife , who put in a wooden floor and displayed English bone china . One might generously call the location " slightly off the beaten track , " but frankly speaking , it was pretty much out in the sticks .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
In this modernistic new musical , Gao Xingjian merges Chinese traditional speaking and singing arts with modern Western theater of the absurd to dramatize how , in the Tang Dynasty , the most famous of Chan koans ( paradoxical statements or questions which , when profoundly meditated upon , may bring the Chan practitioner sudden enlightenment ) became the basis on which power was transmitted from the fifth patriarch , Hungren , to the sixth patriarch , Huineng .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
Mr . Lin , a writer who generally speaking is not averse to tuina massage , once went to a TCM traumatology clinic near his home for some skeletal manipulation . The hundred-square-meter clinic was packed full of patients , and in the middle were three reclining chairs attended a young tuina masseur . The masseur worked on Lin 's neck and back and rotated his shoulders and arms for 20 minutes . Lin heard the sound of his own joints cracking , and felt that his muscles had relaxed quite a lot .

In charge of general medicine in the assembly hall is a Muslim woman doctor , wearing a beautiful tudong ( Muslim headscarf ) , gently asking each patient where it hurts . Across a lawn from the assembly hall , in a space where the dentist has set up , little children , fearful of having their teeth pulled , eyes filling with tears , seem anxious to escape . The doctor from Singapore , speaking to them in Malaysian , 70-80% of which is similar to Indonesian , stays busy trying to keep them mollified .  
Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .

However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time .

Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun .

Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .

Together with other countries , including Egypt , Malaysia supported Indonesia , which , speaking in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement , emphasized that the five declarations by the five nuclear Powers varied in terms of structure and content , as well as remaining devoid of any legal force .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
It was noted that while , generally speaking , the International Law Commission was justified in finding it difficult to impose an equivalent obligation on States parties for crimes under international law in articles 20 , subparagraphs ( b ) to ( d ) , in the absence of a secure jurisdictional basis or a widely accepted extradition regime , the basis of the aut dedere aut judicare obligation was not the treaties referred to in article 20 , subparagraph ( e ) , but article 54 of the statute itself .

KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
FENG Cui ( China ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the representatives of the United States and the European Union had attacked the Chinese Government in their statements and made unfounded allegations , interfering in China 's internal affairs , maligning its judicial system and claiming that China practised torture , misused the death sentence and restricted freedom of speech .

When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .

One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .

Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community .

In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
Generally speaking , reform agents ' participation in limited linguistic and educational psychology research will be planned and organized as an integral part of their professional training .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .

These aggregate figures conceal a wide variation in national economic performance , but broadly speaking , in most of the faster-reforming and faster-growing economies of Central Europe and the Baltic States , the growth rates of industrial production have fallen considerably , while in South-eastern Europe the recession in industry worsened in the second half of the year .  
Mr . Hughes ( New Zealand ) speaking on behalf of the delegations of Australia , Canada and New Zealand ( CANZ ) , said that commendable improvements had been made in the peacekeeping budgets for 19992000 : the use of budget techniques that placed more emphasis on actual field experience rather than standard or notional costings had led to significant reductions in the 19992000 estimates and should lead to a decrease in the large unencumbered balances characteristic of recent peacekeeping budgets .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .

Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
Zeng Peiyan said that generally speaking , the execution of the plan for 1999 was good , and the country basically fulfilled the main regulation and control targets of the economic and social development plan : We continued to maintain a good momentum in national economic development , and there was some improvement in the growth quality and returns ; GDP was 8.2054-trillion yuan , an increase of 7.1 percent on 1998 ;

Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
Now that China has constantly enhanced her national strength in an all-round way , generally speaking , the Sino-US relations are expected to move forward in spite of frequent friction , and out of considerations for its own strategic interests , the United States is also expected to carry on its arms sales to Taiwan within limited space only . 
To promote the spirit of arduous struggling and pursuing effectiveness , we should vigorously advocate a social trend of speaking the truth , doing solid work and pursuing effectiveness .  We should resolutely oppose working in a perfunctory and formalistic manner .  At present , the majority of Party members and cadres are pursuing effectiveness satisfactorily .  
The spirit of struggling hard and obtaining practical results demands that we carry forward the fine spirit of the party , build up our country through hard work and frugality , be industrious and thrifty in managing all undertakings and vigorously carry forward the fine work style of speaking the plain truth , seeking practical results and trying our best to fulfill our responsibility .  The spirit of not hankering after fame and fortune and tendering selfless devotion has demanded that we always think of the people and the party 's cause .

Today , as the world moves toward globalization , and more and more nations are resolving international disputes through international institutions or multilateral diplomacy , the American style of wantonly engaging in military ventures is a bit ironic : a great nation that promotes globalization , the nation with the most speaking privileges in the world 's largest international institutions displaying this kind of outdated militaristic view of national security and unilateralism in its diplomacy that rejects multilateral negotiations !  
He said , international law applies to every country , and this US plane we are speaking of is not an ordinary plane but a military reconnaisance plane which entered China 's airspace without permission after colliding with and destroying a Chinese plane due to carrying out maneuvers contrary to regulations over China 's coastal waters , and landed at a Chinese military airfield .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .

Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "

The theme was set in response to the ILO 's global policy of developing decent work for the youth , and is in perfect accord with the concept of lifelong learning prevailing in Hong Kong . "  
A history professor , Liu Yi-cheng , was very impressed with Chang Ch'i-yun 's written score and speaking performance . When he discovered that Chang 's name was not on the list of accepted students , he checked into the records and found out that Chang had failed the physical exam . Liu Yi-cheng used his seniority as a tenured professor to bring up Chang 's case at a student enrollment meeting .  
Sociologically speaking , six of the groups are clan systems . Among these , the Saisiat , Bunun and Tsou peoples have patriarchal societies ; the Taiya are lineal patriarchal ; and the Ami and Peinan are matriarchal . The Paiwan and Rukai have no clans but rather a system of social classes , similar to the feudal system prevailing during the Chou dynasty ( c . 1066 B . C . to 221 B . C . ) . The Yamis are organized chiefly around " fishing groups . "  
His singing voice must be pure and clean , and his speaking voice low and measured . His movements and gestures must be restrained and steady , what actors call " on the up-and-up . "  
Generally speaking , the more exotic varieties an orchid raiser keeps , the more astonishing the amount of equipment required : since the orchids ca n't be too cold , too hot , too moist , too dry , too shady , or too sunlit , a full panoply of air conditioners , sunlamps , thermostats , mist sprayers , and whatnot is called for .  
Q : Generally speaking , the characteristics of a developed country include a prosperous society with a high income , a high quality of life , a high level of trained personnel , and high mobility , goals which we are engaged in striving to reach . Mr . Premier , would you please discuss for a moment your individual evaluations and expectations ?  
When that girl who was covered with mud and sand lifted up both her arms and turned smiling to the camera , her right hand blocked the center of her face . Traditionally speaking , this would be considered a flaw ; however , after staring at it for quite a while one can sense a joy of guessing and imagination .  
Ideally speaking , the doctor should have knowledge of western medicine , and a dialectic base in Chinese physiology and pathology . Then a complete checkup of the patient can be done . Physicians with more than three years of clinical experience are better skilled .  
After returning to China , Lin lived an impassioned life , writing essays , speaking , running the school , and organizing cultural activities . His passion was devoted to the realization of his ideal of " social aesthetization . "  
Generally speaking , the classical and traditional performing arts are most popular with businessmen . Avant-garde and experimental art is not what they 're after , " Yin points out . Large American and European corporations usually support symphony orchestras and ballet companies , and businessmen in Japan are even more conservative : They consider the firm 's reputation their lifeblood and are even less willing to tie the corporate image to a newcomer .  
From the anxious youth of Lou Ti , to the love of home and country of the overseas student of Women ti Ke , the broken dream of returning home in Fei-ts'ui Chieh-chih , up to the coming together of China and the West in the period of the Boxer Rebellion , Chao Shu-hsia has written down the heavy burden of her own heart while also speaking out about the sorrow and suffering of the overseas Chinese .  
Now , the first thing we discovered wa s that that was nonsense . [ pointing at the MP speaking on the monitor ] Now he is absolutely stable , his arm is on the dispatch box and he is absolutely stuck there , If you watched the Prime Minister earlier this afternoon , however , he will lean forward then step back and turn around . Now you can not have a head and shoulders shot , so you have to have a bigger picture , which in itself is quite interesting .  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
In comparison with the United States , we are a society that has changed relatively more dramatically . Since retrocession , economic growth pulled by the locomotive of exports , universal education and the transformation of social and family structures have all caused a tremendous change in Taiwan 's industry . Relatively speaking . The populous generation born after the war did not have the obvious impact it did in America .  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied . In fact , it can only be considered for use in special circumstances , as passenger transports for airports , as material transporters in enclosed compounds , or as golf carts , which do not involve long distances or high speeds .  
Relatively speaking , Mr . Chang 's modus operandi was very open and generous . He liked cast-of-thousands films that required large investments . Ms . Tung , on the other hand , was more restrained and prudent , and she paid attention to the efficiency of the expenditures , " points out Chen You-hsin , an old-time marquee attraction who often took part in Hsinhua productions . As a result , under their joint direction , Hsinhua had just the right functional balance of boldness and reserve .  
And they ca n't refuse these evenings out but must attend to them like their regular duties in the office . " At the same time as paying close attention to the course of the conversation between the two main parties , they also force themselves to try to be witty and interesting , so as to make the scene more festive , " says Li Tao , director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , speaking from personal experience .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
Give future scholars opportunities to do research , " One enjoys an antique , generally speaking , by admiring fine workmanship , a well-reasoned structure , the luster and grain of beautiful wood . Is it of magnificent appearance , at once stately and full of energy ? Is the workmanship of its embellishments wise - - outstanding without overwhelming its basic shape ? Are its lines smooth and pleasing to the eye ?  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
When speaking of the photography process , Chen remarks that in the beginning she was extremely precise and painstaking about the style of photography , and she discussed it with the photo company 's service lady for a long time . She even filled out a lengthy questionnaire . " Finally , " says Chen Mei-ling , " the photographer arrived , and before we exchanged two sentences , he wrote down the words ' Dignified and demure . ' " The results left her feeling disappointed .  
Although both have reasons for their beliefs , comparatively speaking the mainland 's syllabuses and textbooks contain much more of the ideology of the Communist Party and of socialism , " making it explicit that education must serve politics , " says Huang Cheng-chieh . In his view , Taiwan 's syllabuses also incorporate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People , but it is expressed in " vague and abstract terms , in the hope that it can be acceptable to everyone , and not serve a minority of political parties or interest groups . "  
One of his reasons for writing was to correct some misconceptions about Ming furniture , because " strictly speaking they [ the early foreign collectors ] were biased , for they neglected the fact that there is also a side to Ming furniture of fine carving and intricate decoration , which of course is quite different from the elaborate ornamentation of Qing dynasty palace-style furniture . "  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
" Generally speaking , based on the production process , dZi beads ought to count as a kind of " etched agate " [ agate to which alkaline metal has been applied and heated to create a surface for etching designs ] , " Chang Hung-shih explains .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
In fact , the various statements made by PRC officials at APEC were unsurprising . What was unexpected and regrettable was the lopsided bias toward mainland China displayed by New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon . At a joint ministerial press conference , he prevented ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang from speaking , while allowing PRC officials to answer in his place , and he prevented Taiwan reporters from speaking on several occasions .  
If the proper degree of focus is placed on each of these skills ( i.e . , a 70% focus at the elementary level on listening and speaking , with a gradually increasing emphasis thereafter on reading and writing as students advance through the higher grades ) , we can say good-bye to the problem of elementary students failing to find the groove in junior high due to a change in teaching methods .  
( Chang Chin-ju / tr . by Robert Taylor ) The APEC economic leaders ' meeting was concluded on 21 October . Regrettably , because Taiwan and this year 's host , mainland China , were unable to agree on Taiwan 's choice of representative , and because at a ministerial press conference prior to the leaders ' meeting PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan prevented ROC economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi from speaking , the ROC government decided to withdraw from the summit .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
With a mere 80 or 85 square meters of floor space , design and decorating were handled entirely by Huang and his wife , who put in a wooden floor and displayed English bone china . One might generously call the location " slightly off the beaten track , " but frankly speaking , it was pretty much out in the sticks .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
In this modernistic new musical , Gao Xingjian merges Chinese traditional speaking and singing arts with modern Western theater of the absurd to dramatize how , in the Tang Dynasty , the most famous of Chan koans ( paradoxical statements or questions which , when profoundly meditated upon , may bring the Chan practitioner sudden enlightenment ) became the basis on which power was transmitted from the fifth patriarch , Hungren , to the sixth patriarch , Huineng .  
Tsao Fu-yung admits frankly that this was a very difficult task . " Just think , we 'd all been in Chinese opera for so long that we had long since grown accustomed to the Peking Opera style of singing , speaking and moving . Now we had to put all that aside and start again with a completely new face-but none of us was at all sure what that new face was supposed to be , and even now we 're still feeling our way forward . "  
Mr . Lin , a writer who generally speaking is not averse to tuina massage , once went to a TCM traumatology clinic near his home for some skeletal manipulation . The hundred-square-meter clinic was packed full of patients , and in the middle were three reclining chairs attended a young tuina masseur . The masseur worked on Lin 's neck and back and rotated his shoulders and arms for 20 minutes . Lin heard the sound of his own joints cracking , and felt that his muscles had relaxed quite a lot .  
From finding things unacceptable , indecipherable , harsh , and nightmarish , they have been able to put aside their old postures and really change themselves , learning to re-examine themselves and accept new ways of speaking and acting . With the additional help of meditation , visualization , and relaxation exercises , they 've broken through mere habit by developing their inner potential .  
In charge of general medicine in the assembly hall is a Muslim woman doctor , wearing a beautiful tudong ( Muslim headscarf ) , gently asking each patient where it hurts . Across a lawn from the assembly hall , in a space where the dentist has set up , little children , fearful of having their teeth pulled , eyes filling with tears , seem anxious to escape . The doctor from Singapore , speaking to them in Malaysian , 70-80% of which is similar to Indonesian , stays busy trying to keep them mollified .  
Chronologically speaking , each segment in the process was tightly linked . A MOE-certified candidate who completed teacher training in the summer of 1999 would then have to move on to the next phase of earning education credits at an academic institution by September ; 40 credits later , the prospective instructor would then have to locate an elementary school at which to complete the one year internship . Only strict adherence to this schedule would lead to a complete MOE endorsement - - a teacher 's certificate - - by September , 2001 .  
Generally speaking , before the 1980s the focus of agriculturalists was on improving production and increasing the strains ' ability to withstand heat and disease , whereas since the 1980s the emphasis has been on improving quality , to make the cooked rice as succulent , firm , and delicious as possible .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun . " For example , whereas the Atayal , high mountain dwellers like the Bunun , had internal divisions and even wars among themselves , the Bunun were very loyal to the group , maintaining unity against outsiders .  
speaking of bilateral relations , jiang said that enhancing friendship with neighboring countries is a major part of china 's foreign policy , adding : " china attaches great importance to expanding friendly and mutual beneficial cooperation relations with india "  
beijing , december 9 ( xinhua ) a representative of foreign military attaches based in beijing , speaking at an annual get together dinner tonight , called for further enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between the people 's liberation army ( pla ) and the armies of foreign countries  
Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .  When speaking of these qualities , one is inclined to ponder the work on the reform of the Security Council .  
Together with other countries , including Egypt , Malaysia supported Indonesia , which , speaking in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement , emphasized that the five declarations by the five nuclear Powers varied in terms of structure and content , as well as remaining devoid of any legal force .  
As far as the statement my delegation made that morning is concerned and here I would say that I am speaking also for the other delegations that made statements we considered the statements to be factual and to truly reflect current global public opinion against nuclear testing , both in the South Pacific and elsewhere .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
It was noted that while , generally speaking , the International Law Commission was justified in finding it difficult to impose an equivalent obligation on States parties for crimes under international law in articles 20 , subparagraphs ( b ) to ( d ) , in the absence of a secure jurisdictional basis or a widely accepted extradition regime , the basis of the aut dedere aut judicare obligation was not the treaties referred to in article 20 , subparagraph ( e ) , but article 54 of the statute itself .  
First and foremost , the United Nations must be seen to be " speaking with one voice " - hence , the crucial importance of demonstrated leadership by the Secretary-General , clearly recognized and accepted by the other involved elements of the United Nations system and reflected in the overarching strategic framework presented to the donor community .

BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
KODELLAS ( Greece ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that for the past 21 years it had been indisputable that the Cyprus problem was a clear case of the violation of the territorial integrity , unity and sovereignty of an independent State , of massive human rights violations and of the artificial division of a country by military force . 
The establishment for an initial 12-month period of a major operation with a significant military contingent could , in our opinion , not only foster mutual trust and discourage any thoughts of outside interference , but also , generally speaking , ensure security throughout the region during the transitional period and oversee the demilitarization process . 
FENG Cui ( China ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the representatives of the United States and the European Union had attacked the Chinese Government in their statements and made unfounded allegations , interfering in China 's internal affairs , maligning its judicial system and claiming that China practised torture , misused the death sentence and restricted freedom of speech .  
KAMAL ( Pakistan ) , speaking on agenda item 112 ( c ) , said that , while there were many types of human rights violations , the primary concern of the United Nations was the systematic violation of human rights committed by States and persons in authority and that the United Nations could influence Member States to take legislative , administrative and judicial measures to promote and protect human rights .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
INCERA ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group 77 and China , said that the strengthening of oversight and audit functions was a fundamental means of achieving the efficient , transparent and responsible management of the Organization 's resources , particularly in the light of the current financial crisis .

MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
Their employees are provided with public transport but not food and , generally speaking , their living conditions are harsh and inhumane , leading one migrant worker to say It 's exploitation ; the living conditions are unbearable , like in a prison .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .

Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community .

Generally speaking , reform agents ' participation in limited linguistic and educational psychology research will be planned and organized as an integral part of their professional training .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .

Mr . Hughes ( New Zealand ) speaking on behalf of the delegations of Australia , Canada and New Zealand ( CANZ ) , said that commendable improvements had been made in the peacekeeping budgets for 19992000 : the use of budget techniques that placed more emphasis on actual field experience rather than standard or notional costings had led to significant reductions in the 19992000 estimates and should lead to a decrease in the large unencumbered balances characteristic of recent peacekeeping budgets .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .

We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Mr . Jayanama ( Thailand ) , speaking under subitems 114 ( b ) and ( e ) , stressed the universality , indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights and the importance of giving equal attention to civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights . 
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the least developed countries , said that economic interdependence was a matter of utmost importance for the developing countries , and their interests had to be recognized and reflected in the reform of the international financial system . 
The representative of Ethiopia , speaking on behalf of the African Group , stressed the complex and daunting development challenges facing the LDCs and argued that the resolution of such challenges required a multi-dimensional approach encompassing increased development aid and outright debt cancellation , enhanced productive capacity and reduced supply constraints , improved market access , and a mutually supportive domestic and international policy environment .  
The representative of France , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed through extrabudgetary resources .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reiterated the importance attached by his Group to the question of the financing of experts in UNCTAD expert meetings and the need for funding in that respect .  The participation of experts from developing countries enhanced the complementarity between technical cooperation and analytical and deliberative work and helped in integrating these activities , as called for by UNCTAD X .  
The Government also wishes to record its categorical disagreement with and rejection of the double-counting and descriptions in the report of the appalling acts committed by the paramilitary groups , firstly speaking of violations of civil and political rights and secondly referring to violations of the terms of international humanitarian law as expressed in conventions and customary law .  
By adopting the recommendation of the Commission on Human Settlements acting as the preparatory committee , the General Assembly decided that the last two speaking slots at each plenary meeting , with the exception of the first and last plenary meetings , would be reserved for participants other than Member States , the Holy See , Switzerland and Palestine , provided that were represented at the highest level .  
The representative of Singapore , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said the Expert Meeting had provided a unique opportunity for national experts from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to share their experience and to express their views and concerns in an international forum on the impact of AD / CVD actions .  
The representative of Belgium , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) , stated that although the economic concerns of the least developed countries had been at the forefront of the development debate for more than three decades , the results were not encouraging .  He observed that the Brussels Declaration provided hope that the next decade would be different from the previous two .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .
