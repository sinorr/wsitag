the Ninth Five-Year Plan raised the idea of changing the country 's economic structure and growth pattern ; while the 10th Five-Year Plan has emphasized that the country " must center its efforts around the task of improving economic efficiency , and must make strategic readjustments to its economic structure .

the Ninth Five-Year Plan raised the idea of changing the country 's economic structure and growth pattern ; while the 10th Five-Year Plan has emphasized that the country " must center its efforts around the task of improving economic efficiency , and must make strategic readjustments to its economic structure .

The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .

The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area .
