The voting results on this counter-draft resolution and on the original Russian-United States bilateral nuclear arms negotiation that it is designed to belittle will have far more impact on my Government ' s attitude towards the concept of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to nuclear disarmament than will all the rhetoric that we have heard alleging genuine desire in the international community to seek progress towards nuclear disarmament .
