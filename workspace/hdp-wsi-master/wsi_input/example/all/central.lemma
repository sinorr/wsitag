Linghu An noted : Ever since the central authorities established the strategy on a large-scale development of China 's western region , Yunnan has attached great importance to the work ; regarded and studied its participation in the large-scale development of the western region as a major issue which has a great bearing on the economic and social development of the entire province ; and has drawn up the " Overall Conception for Yunnan 's Action Plan Concerning the Large-Scale Development of China 's Western Region . "  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .  All this proves highly beneficial to our efforts to develop the software industry in China 's central and western regions .  
Yunnan deputy Wang Shikun [ 3769-0013-0981 ] said : The Standing Committee put supervision in an important position last year .  The law-enforcement inspection which centered round the state 's central tasks , the actual implementation of the law as well as key and difficult problems of great concern to the masses played a positive role in promoting the practice of doing things and exercising administration according to law in the local governments .  
the building of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and legal system was further intensified ; and social stability was maintained .  These achievements are the results of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core taking charge of the overall situation and providing correct leadership , and the results of all levels throughout the country implementing the central policy decision on expanding domestic demand and the series of guidelines and policies , and working hard with concerted efforts .  
Only if all sectors devote great , genuine , and hard efforts in improving scientific management and extract efficiency , quality , and returns from management can they truly implement well the central guidelines , policies , and reform measures , and promote the healthy development of economic and social undertakings .  
Faced with the new situations and problems that have emerged in market economy , in accordance with the demands of the central authorities , the central departments concerned and many localities have engaged in bold exploration and practice , and regarded mass activities to build spiritual civilization as an important carrier for ideological and political work ; they have attached importance to the social education function of culture , and paid attention to giving play to the demonstration role of advanced typical examples .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
Guo Zhenqian said the Financial and Economic Committee held that the 2000 central and local government budget arrangements have implemented the requirement for continued enforcement of a positive financial policy ; realized the spirit of readjusting structure , expanding domestic demand , ensuring main areas , promoting development , and maintaining stability ;  
paid attention to suppressing and saving general expenditure while practicing an positive financial policy ; striven to control the scale of financial deficit and debt ; and decreased the central government 's financial deficit compared with previous year when calculated in terms of comparable items .  
After last year 's central budget was approved , in the light of changes in the domestic and international situations , the party central committee and State Council decided to step up implementation of a positive financial policy .  
With the approval of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee , the central budget was adjusted ; discount interests on state treasury bonds for increasing investment in infrastructure construction and enterprises ' technological transformation were increased ; extra budgetary revenues were used to increase wages of staff members and workers of administrative units and institutions and to increase social insurance revenues ;  
The Finance and Economic Committee is of the opinion that the central and local budgets for 2000 are in line with the requirement of continuing to implement a positive financial policy , and manifest the spirit of adjusting the economic structure , increasing domestic demand , assuring key expenditures , boosting development , and maintaining stability .  
Third , the work of economic and social development in 2000 should comprehensively implement all policies and measures set forth by the central leadership ; correctly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability ; give prominence to the proper handling of reforms and development in state-owned enterprises , the economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and expansion of domestic demand ;  
Committee members focused on central tasks to serve the overall situation , and , from a perspective of pushing forward reform and opening , economic development , and safeguarding stability , earnestly performed their functions in conducting political consultation , exercising democratic supervision , and participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs , and offered many valuable suggestions and proposals , whose quality was better than last year .

Practice has proven that the central authorities ' series of policy decisions and arrangements are completely correct , practical , and effective , and have laid the foundation and pointed out the orientation for us to explore and embark on an anticorruption path suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
First , the western region has obvious advantage in natural resources , such as energy , minerals , tourism , and land .  At present , of the 140 kinds of proven mineral deposits of the country , over 120 are in the central and western region and the deposits of some rare metals there rank first in the country .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
After summing up the situation in reviewing the " three stresses " educational work of the previous stage , Zhang Quanjing pointed out : The central authorities have decided to conduct a " review " campaign after concluding the centralized " three stresses " education .  This is an important move for further consolidating and expanding the achievements in the " three stresses " education and is the specific embodiment of the principle of running the party strictly in the " three stresses " education .  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
On solving the relationships between the central and local authorities , and between the Kremlin and various party factions , Putin has actively consulted with all leaders , striven to reach consensus , and successively promulgated relevant policies , so that Russia 's political situation would not sink into a chaotic situation before the election .  One after another , leaders of various parties and local leaders expressed their support for Putin 's presidential race .  
Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Recently , the state has promulgated the " Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Granting Preferential Treatment to Foreign-Invested Enterprises Set Up in the Central and Western Regions by Reducing Enterprise Income Tax Rate to 15 Percent in Three Years , " by which the foreign-invested enterprises encouraged by the state to set up in the central and western regions may reduce their enterprise income tax to 15 percent within three years after the current term of the tax preferential policy expires .  This will energetically boost foreign investment in the central and western regions .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
To push forward the large-scale development of the western region , all localities are required to act in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities , carry out their work in a down-to-earth manner , further broaden their vision , and base their work on a higher starting point , stressed Wu Bangguo .  
The meeting held : Since a similar national televised and teleconference was held last year , most central and local media units have striven to separate news-reporting activities from commercial activities , and to separate news-covering and editing personnel from commercial departments , and attained remarkable results in this regard .  
In 1999 , various localities had , in line with the CPC Central Committee 's unified arrangements , conscientiously implemented the principle of " singing aloud the major theme song and of seizing well initiative , served the overall situation by concentrating efforts on the central task of economic construction , done a massive amount of meticulous work , and scored marked success .  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
The central leadership made the major policy decision on the great development of China 's west .  The national economy is undergoing strategic restructuring .  The state set forth a series of policies for expanding domestic demand and promoting economic growth .  
The central government has put an end to its past practice of uniform and direct central management and control by allowing various localities and departments to adopt flexible or varied production or operation modes ; has called for developing a superior economy by suiting measures to the local conditions or opportunities ; has urged all sectors to carry out economic accounting and ensure economic efficiency ;  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
Chen Xiwen has long been involved in agricultural economic theory and policy research .  He worked on drafting documents for the central government regarding problems of farming villages .  He wrote more than 10 books about this subject .  He also published more than 150 dissertations and research reports .  He is an expert in this field .

"  Under the situation in which there were a-hundred things to do , the central finance allocated 4-million yuan of special funds in three years running to the border areas for their development and defined specific plans urging the inland developed provinces and cities to support the border minority nationalities areas .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .  
Third , to verify the situation of personnel structure and personnel change of the central budget units , and understand in detail the manning quota of the budget units , the actual number and structure of the staff , and the situation of actual average expenditure per person for every outlay in order to provide basic numbers for determining the standard of a fixed number of staff and fixed quotas which meet the real situation .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .

Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central and provincial authorities , we have conscientiously organized the " three-stress " education and , combining it with the activities of setting up " united , clean , and good leading groups with a pioneering spirit " launched in the entire city , lost no time in resolving the problems unsuited to the new situation and new tasks facing the party building and the SEZ development .  
We will certainly live up to the earnest expectations of the party 's central committee .  In accordance with the requirements of the " Three Represents , " we will strengthen the party building in a comprehensive way , lead the people of the entire city to summon up all their courage and energy , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and work hard to build Shenzhen into a socialist demonstration city bearing Chinese characteristics and taking the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Zhu Rongji stated that the State Council is going to organize a special force and , once an in-depth investigative study is completed , propose a plan for improving the social security system at the end of the year .  Once it is approved by the central authorities , it may be implemented on a trial basis in Liaoning first , while the other provinces and regions may select one or two local places and cities to implement pilot projects , promoting it comprehensively once we have obtained some experience .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
After establishing " energy and transportation as key strategic points , " the late ' 80s and early ' 90s saw the inception of huge projects such as the Three Gorges Dam , the comprehensive hydro-power development of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He River , accelerating development of western oil and central coal fields , and the extension of the Yanlonghai railway line as the " second continental bridge , " among other large-scale projects that concentrated funding in the west .  
The requirements set by the third-generation core of party leadership have been conscientiously carried out , and constant attention has been paid to educating the army in advanced ideology , ethics , science , and culture and encouraging and inspiring officers and men with fine intellectual products ; as a result , they have in different periods of time created a number of fine literary and artistic works embodying the spirit and giving full scope to the central theme of the times .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "

The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .

In his important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a brilliant analysis and profound exposition of the important position , main tasks , guiding ideology , and basic requirements of the party 's ideological and political work in the new period , and major issues that need handling in doing the work , from the height of both international and domestic overall situations .  
For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
The broad policies and specific principles for reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty have been clearly laid down by the central authorities and all major policy measures have been promulgated .  The key now is to continue the effort to implement them properly in accordance with the central authorities ' plan .  It is necessary to harmonize speed with efficiency , scale with structure , and quantity with quality , putting quality improvement and efficiency enhancement first ;  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
In China , due to the unbalanced economic development , the central and western areas , where Chinese Moslems live in compact communities , lag behind the eastern areas and are still afflicted with poverty .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
We must study his noble character of being loyal to the party and the people , study his lofty spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth , and study his solid and strict style of work .  Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on foreign affairs , unflinchingly carry out the foreign policy of independence and peace , and further open up a new prospect for China 's diplomatic work .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
In October 1978 , the central government convened the third national people 's defense work conference , determined the people 's air defense principle of " making overall planning , giving play to major points , integrating peacetime and wartime efforts , and putting quality first , " thus entering a stage in the people 's air defense work that stressed comprehensive and coordinated development , quality , and combining peacetime and wartime efforts .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
In dealing with both inflation and deflation , the party central leadership and the State Council consistently gave play to the role of the market as the foundation for distributing resources , comprehensively employed various economic levers , employed necessary legal and administrative means as supplements , and accumulated rich experience in conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
The party and government 's handling of this historically rare incident again showed that the party central with Jiang Zemin at the core possesses the extraordinary ability to drive internal politics and foreign relations and sharp leadership skills for handling all kinds of complex situations .  
Since the third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and especially since the third central meeting on Tibet work , the people of Qamdo have held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , conscientiously implemented the guidelines for Tibet work in the new period , firmly maintained stability , opposed division , worked hard to deepen reforms and opened wider to the outside world , and thus further speeded up the pace of economic and social development .  
The " Proposal " elevates science and technology progress to the same high plane as reform and opening up and puts it forward as an impetus to national economic and social development .  This is a new improvement to the understanding of the impetus to the development of socialism , as well as an innovation and development in Deng Xiaoping Theory made by the third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
After the reversion , the government of the special administrative region made the solution of social security the primary job under the strong support of the central government and increased the force to hit all crime activities , and had a distinct affect .  
promoting the economic , educational , scientific , and cultural cooperation and interchange between Macao and the inland , connecting people from all circles of Macao , improving the association between Macao and the inland , reflecting the opinions that Macao residents have to the inland , managing the related Taiwan affairs , undertaking other matters that the central government hands over . 
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
When moving into the new century , we have all reasons to believe that under the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the strong leadership of the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we will certainly be able to surmount all challenges and risks from either domestic or foreign factors , and the banner of socialism will flutter high on the vast land of China for ever .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .  Their evil intention is to create chaos in China and to undermine social stability , making it impossible for the masses of the people to work , study , and live normally , disrupting economic construction , which is a central task , and then proceeding to realize their political scheme of overthrowing the CPC leadership and changing the socialist system in China .  
Discussing the current work of taking stock of and straightening out " state investments , " Dai Xianglong revealed that in the past one or two years the central bank has held frequent consultations with local governments on the question of straightening out trust and investment companies , because the great majority of these companies , apart from a few , are the equity controlling or total investment companies of the local governments .  
In the political sphere described by Putin as the " crux of Russia 's rejuvenation , " Russia has , by means of the Federal Constitution , straightened out the relations between the central authorities and various republics , oblasts , and border regions ; curbed the separatist tendency of local regimes ; and severely cracked down on the separatist attempt by illegal armed groups in Chechenya , initially restoring a powerful state power system .  
Power struggle between local officials , plenipotentiaries directly commissioned by the President to federate regions , and central administrative institutions may arise from time to time .  In particular , the establishment of peace in Chechenya and the shaping of its future will remain a longstanding headache for Russia .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
In compliance with the trend in history and by giving account to Hong Kong 's situation and interests , the central authorities set forth the important principles of " one country , two systems , " " Hong Kong being governed by local people , " and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong . This is aimed at maintaining Hong Kong 's existing commodity city model in the operation of the market economy and enabling Hong Kong to continue to play an important role as a major trading port .  
The enormous achievements accomplished during the " 9th Five-Year Plan " period are the result of the joint striving of the entire nation under circumstances whereby the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin was faced with numerous conflicts and difficulties and promptly established a series of proper policies and dispositions from its central command position .  
At present , with the kind attention of the central authorities and the vigorous support of the people of the whole country , the people of all ethnic groups in our region are firmly seizing the rare opportunity provided by the stable political situation and the large-scale development of west China and , with unprecedented enthusiasm and drive , striking up a magnificent movement of leapfrogging development .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
Upholding the four cardinal principles and persisting in reform and opening up are closely integrated and mutually stimulating , and they can not be separated or set against each other ; we must unify into the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics the combination of regarding economic construction as the central task with the four cardinal principles and with reform and opening up .  
At the meeting , attendees diligently studied the important speeches of Jiang Zemin , Zhu Rongji , and other central leading comrades concerning the work related to public order , as well as the spirits of the national public order work conference and the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order ; and mapped out arrangements for launching a nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
According to the spirit of the central economic work conference and the Fourth Session of the Ninth National People 's Congress , the meeting analyzed the current situation , unified people 's thinking , and set forth the main tasks and key points for this year 's work .  
All localities and all departments must keep a strong sense of political responsibility and the spirit of being highly responsible to the interests of the people , carefully organize their actions according to the unified arrangements of the central leadership , take effective measures and achieve solid results in restoring a regular and orderly condition of the market so that the people can be satisfied and can set their minds at rest .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
We must fully understand the importance and urgency of doing a good job of public security work , earnestly implement the " strike hard " principle and various measures for comprehensive management of social security , which were formulated by the central authorities , and create a sound social environment for the state 's long-term political stability and economic development .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
The decree urges all officers and men throughout the military to rally still more closely around the party central committee , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , consciously study and practice the requirements of the " three represents , " work in a down-to-earth manner , wage unremitting struggles , step up preparations for military struggles , and constantly raise our military 's defense and combat capabilities under modern conditions , thereby making even greater contributions toward realizing reunification of the motherland and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
Soon afterward , the army crossed the Chang Jiang to the south .  After a half year of arduous long-distance marching and fighting , it arrived in central Hunan where it fulfilled its mission of establishing an anti-Japanese base area centered around Heng Shan .  
In August of that same year , after Japan surrendered , the army , upon receiving orders from the central leadership , continued south , arriving in northern Guangdong where it prepared for a rendezvous with the Dongjiang Column . However , with its advance blocked by the Kuomingtang troops , it went north to rendezvous again with the 5th Division of the New 4th Army .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
However , facts have shown Hong Kong 's Falungong has a political purpose when its members exercise , it has reduced itself to the status of a political organization following Li Hongzhi 's order and targeting at the central government , and it has continued to engage in activities incompatible with the stated purpose when it registered itself as a social group .  
It is only right and natural that such an action is unacceptable to them .  As to Falungong 's plan to have Falungong elements from overseas gather in Hong Kong to repeat what they did during a previous international gathering , it is another sinister attempt to transform Hong Kong into an anti-Chinese base targeting at the central government .  
The procedure also stipulates that no Internet online service business sites are to be set up within 200 meters of such places as key central party , political , and military organs , within 200 meters of middle and elementary schools , and in residential buildings .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
Unify the standards for textbook writing .  Rural primary and secondary schools should adopt economical and suitable editions .  Governments of provinces ( autonomous regions , municipalities directly administered by the central government ) should procure and distribute textbooks using the bidding method and have textbooks delivered to students on time at the least costs while ensuring quality .  
The comrades in charge of pertinent departments and units under the party 's central committee and State Council and the Beijing-based comrades in charge of the backbone enterprises managed by the central authorities attended the meeting at the main conference hall .  The leading comrades from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and those from various prefectural ( city ) and county people 's governments and relevant departments attended the meeting at sub-meeting-rooms .  
Efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the central authorities pursuing the large-scale western development strategy , put reconstruction work onto the local governments ' 10th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development and their programs for poverty eradication through development , promote development through the reconstruction efforts , and unceasingly facilitate common prosperity among all ethnic groups .  
On behalf of the party central committee and the State Council and also in his personal name , he extended warm congratulations to the entire staff of teachers , students , and other staff of Qinghua University , and extended cordial greetings to teachers , students , and staffs of all institutions of higher education and comrades engaged in educational work throughout the country .  
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
He said : Implementing the strategy to speed up development in China 's central and west regions is a major government policy drawn out according to the country 's overall situation and geared to the new century .  It is of great significance for China to gradually narrow the gap among various regions , promote a coordinated growth , and push forward the common prosperity of all nationalities in the country .  It is also an important policy for materializing the third-step objectives of China 's modernization drive .  
Comrades in charge of pertinent departments under central and state organs , comrades assigned to take charge of the work from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and persons in charge of the people 's governments at prefectural , city , and county levels participated in the conference .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
Now facing the 21st century , we must adhere to the theme of development , focus on economic construction as the central task unswervingly , work hard to realize the " four modernizations , " and accomplish the historical mission of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation .  To achieve this grand goal , we must make energetic efforts to improve the basic quality of the whole people .  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , especially since the third central conference on work in Tibet , various undertakings have surged forward full of vigor , the outlook of urban and rural areas has changed greatly , and people 's living standards have been raised .  All those are unprecedented in the history of Tibet .  
The propaganda and ideological front must center closely on the theme of celebrations defined by the central authorities ; firmly grasp the correction orientation ; loudly chorus the main theme of the Communist Party , socialism , and the drive of reform and opening up being good ; vigorously create a rich and dense atmosphere of loving the party , loving the motherland , and loving socialism ;  
and inspire all Communists and the people in their hundreds and millions , to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; rally more closely around the central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; adhere to the party 's basic line and program ; heighten fighting spirit ; forge ahead while constantly opening up new prospects in work ; and unremittingly struggle for the realization of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization in the new century .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
It has been more than a month since the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order was held .  During that period , all localities and all departments have been conscientiously living up to the spirit of the central work conference in light of local conditions and taken effective and concrete measures to launch market economic order rectification work , with emphasis on investigating a number of major and large cases , with some initial success .  
Since the 1980 ' s , the central government has practiced a series of preferential policies toward Tibet , which include the agricultural tax exemption for the agricultural and pastoral areas in recuperation and the abolition of planned purchases and quota purchases of agricultural , animal , special , and local products by the state ;  
Such achievements have made an important contribution to the successful implementation of " the 9th five-year " plan in our region and the basic realization of developmental goals established at the third Tibet Work Forum set forth by the central authorities .  They have also created favorable conditions for carrying out the strategic goal of a leap forward in economic and social development in our region during the new period .  
we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .  
It is learned that the personnel appointments for the ministers of all departments in the States Council and the governors of all provinces have been made .  Although the primary leaders of the State Council ministries and commission should be changed in 2003 according to the usual practice , this time , to quicken the process of fostering and promoting younger cadres , the central leadership decided to make the changes ahead of time .  Thus , the leadership changes at the ministerial and provincial governor level will be completed prior to the 16th party national congress .  
3 .  The mainland failed to coordinate .  Due to the differences of views between its central and local authorities and between its different local authorities , it lacked unified policies for approving and issuing entry certificates to the people of our side .  It also deferred in eliminating the obstacles of laws to its commodity imports and exports and imposed strict restrictions on its people 's visits to Kinmen and Matsu , thus limiting the implementation of the three mini links .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
We must always uphold the guidelines for work in Tibet during the new period formulated at the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , which call for " taking economic construction as the central task ; firmly focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation ; and ensuring Tibet 's accelerated economic development , all-round social progress , lasting peace and stability , and continuous improvement of the people 's living standards . "  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
We must never be unworthy of the concern and expectation of the central authorities and the whole nation .  We must overcome all difficulties , work vigorously to make the region prosperous , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , and produce brilliant results once more in the course of developing Tibet by leaps and bounds and ensuring lasting peace and stability .

On behalf of the party central leadership and the State Council , he extended warm congratulations to the advanced collectives and individuals being commended , and also extended cordial greetings to the comrades working in the front of legal system propaganda and education throughout the country .  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .

In order to bring about peaceful reunification , Mr . Deng Xiaoping on 26 June 1983 elaborated on a six-point proposal : Holding " talks on an equal footing to achieve a third round of cooperation , rather than talks between the central and local governments " , " after reunification , the Taiwan special administration region may practice a social system different from that of the mainland ;  
Recently , " Nanfang Zhoumo " , a weekend magazine in Guangzhou , was " purged " on a large scale because its reportage deviated from the standards laid down by the central authorities .  The contingent of editors and reporters was changed substantively .  The leading body of the editorial office was changed ; several editors and reporters were dismissed or disciplined ; other editors and reporters had to be reexamined and reassessed .  
It is necessary to check the implementation of the spirit of the central directives and National Social Order Work Conference , examine whether the localities have dealt with the critical points in line with local reality , and review the effects of the " strike hard " struggle .  They should also inspect the cases jointly handled by the central political and law departments and localities , the crackdown on triads , the removal of the " protective umbrella " granted to the triad forces , as well as the difficulties and obstacles encountered in attacking triads .  
Recently , the Chinese Communists ' high-level departments concerned , including the Central Political Science and Law Group , have proclaimed that the campaign to suppress Falungong has achieved fruitful results at this stage , adding that this is entirely attributable to the central authorities ' decision plus the " decisive and resolute " action taken by the public security sector .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
To properly organize various commemorative activities , we should follow the guidance of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , closely surround the main theme determined by the party central leadership , and sing aloud the eulogy for praising the Communist Party , socialism , and reform and opening up with full enthusiasm and strong assurance , thus encouraging the entire party membership and the people to continue to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and march forward to create a bright future for the cause of socialist modernization .  
He said that party committees and governments at all levels in Sichuan have seriously implemented a series of central principles and policies to strengthen the protection and improvement of the ecological environment , taken the lead in launching the project to protect natural forests and making experiments on returning farmland to forests , taken prompt actions with a resolute attitude , done solid work and adopted effective measures .  They have enabled the people to consciously implement the party 's policies , accumulated much successful experience , and attained remarkable achievements .  
In May last year , the center received a tip-off reflecting that principal leaders of the party committee of Qingyang Prefecture , Gansu Province , recklessly promoted cadres without regard to the regulations on bringing promotion of cadres under strict control before organizational realignment , set forth by the central authorities and the provincial party committee .  After that , the center entrusted the Organizational Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee to investigate into and handle this case .  
The central leadership recently decided to adopt a management system " with responsibility being borne by local governments , mainly at the county level , and management being conducted from top to bottom at each administrative level under the unified leadership of the State Council " .  Under this system , the responsibilities for each level from central , to provincial , and then prefecture ( city ) and county are all explicitly defined .  In particular , counties must bear the main responsibility for local rural compulsory education .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
In order to strengthen guidance for building rural grass-roots party organizations , the central authorities and relevant departments promulgated in succession the " CPC regulations governing the work of rural grass-roots organizations " , the " opinions of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of ranks of rural grass-roots cadres " , the " circular on universally implementing in the rural areas the systems of making village affairs public and managing village affairs in a democratic way " , and other important documents .  
" Falungong " is a cult .  This is not determined by the " will of the chief executive " , nor is it the central government 's subjective " decision " .  It is an iron-clad fact based on innumerable instances , and the conclusion is based on foreign governments ' legislation experiences .  
The third generation of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has shown great foresight , managed the overall situation , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , continued to deepen reform and expanded opening up , vigorously advanced the building of the socialist market economy system , surmounted difficulties , overcome all kinds of risks from political and economic fields as well as from nature , and succeeded in realizing a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and safeguarding social and political stability .  
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
The first leap took place during the new democratic revolutionary period .  The first generation of central leadership collective with Mao Zedong at the core led the whole party and the people throughout the country to find China 's own revolutionary road through repeated explorations and on the basis of summing up successful and unsuccessful experiences , and established Mao Zedong Thought .  
We firmly believe , that under the leadership of the spirit of this fourth seminar held by the central committee on the work in Tibet , and through the united struggle of all levels of the region , both high and low , especially the united struggle of the broad mass of farmers and herders and of grass-roots cadres , we will certainly be able to accomplish the goals and tasks of the work of assisting the impoverished and of development during this new stage . 
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
Reviewing and summarizing the glorious 80-year history of our party , we have come to a more profound understanding that always integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the concrete practice of China 's revolution and construction , always firmly relying on the millions of people to acquire endless motive force for progress , and always comprehensively strengthening and improving party building in line with the party 's central task constitute the basic experience for our party to conquer hardships , maintain vigor , and make progress continuously .  
In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
First , on behalf of the party central leadership , he extended warm congratulations to the commended advanced collectives and outstanding individuals , and expressed cordial greetings to all Communist Party members and the vast mass of cadres and workers in the central departments .  
Party organizations at all levels and the vast party rank and file and party cadres in the central departments must take the lead in studying and implementing Comrade Jiang Zemin 's recent important instructions on strengthening and improving the party 's style building , make great effort to carry forward the good tradition and style developed by the party over a long period of practice , effectively and properly solve the prominent problems existing in the field of style , and take concrete actions to build a good image for the leading organs among the people .  
He said : The meeting conscientiously studied the important instructions of Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades on doing a good job in finding out and reflecting social conditions and public opinions , summed up and exchanged the experience in doing this work well , and set forth opinions and proposals on further strengthening and deepening this work .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
He first extended warm congratulations to the commended advanced workers and collectives on behalf of the party central leading body , expressed lofty respects for all experts and scholars in the study of party history , and expressed cordial greetings to the vast number of party history researchers and workers throughout the country .  
When talking about the central government 's 2000 final accounting report approved by the Standing Committee , Li Peng said : It is necessary to more effectively implement the law on budgets and the decision on intensifying the central government 's budget auditing supervision and other relevant laws , guarantee that the budget of the current fiscal year approved by the NPC session will be implemented properly , prevent the appearance of law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena in the course of implementing the budget .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practicable steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
The incident greatly shocked the central hierarchy .  A top leader was said to be so angry that he pounded at the table as he rebuked the two public security and court officials for being decadent in the extreme .  He said that they deserved at least a-thousand deaths for selling their country for a mere sum of money .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
All localities should make arrangements around the key fields pointed out by the central leadership in connection with their local conditions , fully mobilize the masses , concentrate the police force , crack accumulated cases , smash criminal gangs , seize criminals at large .  In particular , more severe and rapid actions should be taken to crack criminal cases , especially serious and malicious cases occurring in the period of the " strike hard " period .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
Luo Gan said : Comrade Dong Biwu was a proletarian revolutionary revered and cherished by the entire party and all people throughout the country .  He was a founder of the CPC , an outstanding Marxist politician and law expert , an important member of the party 's first-generation leading collective , and an important member of the central people 's government of the New China .  
4 .  Fee collection standards which exceed those formulated by the State Council , the government of a province , autonomous region , or municipality directly subordinate to the central government , or national and provincial level planning , pricing , and finance organizations , is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees to the extent of the excess portion .  
Legally authorized fees reviewed and approved at the national and provincial level , and policies formulated by organizations in charge of prices at the central and provincial levels which involve agricultural prices and the collection of fees for services , must also be thoroughly put in order .  Start with a grasp of the actual situation , examine items category by category , reexamine and define .  
He first expressed warm welcome to the triumphant return of the delegation on behalf of the party central leadership , the State Council , and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , expressed warm congratulations and cordial greetings to the members of the bidding delegation and all people participating in the bidding work , and expressed heartfelt gratitude to all friends who support Beijing 's bid .  
He said : Beijing Municipality will certainly live up to the ardent hopes of the party central leadership and the entire people throughout the country .  With the winning of the bid as a driving force , with " new Beijing , new Olympic Games " as the main theme , we shall seize the great opportunity to advance reform , opening-up , and modernization in Beijing and show the whole world a new look of Beijing .  
For instance , gratifying changes have emerged in the problem of commercial banks ' bad debts , which had been regarded as a " time bomb " by many financial experts at home and abroad : The central bank has announced that the rate of bad debts of state-owned commercial banks has started to fall since the fourth quarter of last year , and on average it dropped by 2.1 percentage points during the first six months of this year .  
The central authorities earnestly hope that the vast number of cadres and people in Tibet will earnestly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech and the fourth forum on Tibetan affairs , seize the opportunities , take advantage of them , work in a down-to-earth manner , and work hard to expedite Tibet 's economic growth from accelerated growth to leap-and-bound growth , and to further improve Tibet 's social situation from a basically stable one to one marked by long-term peace and stability .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
According to state regulations , county-level financial departments should pay wages directly to teachers on regular payrolls .  As to the counties without sufficient financial resources and with actual difficulties in paying wages to teachers , problems in this area should be resolved through readjustment of the expenditure structure and in the way to increase transfer payments between central and local revenues .  
The celebrations have fully reflected the tremendous progress achieved by Tibet over the past 50 years , given wide publicity to the principles and policies of the central authorities toward Tibet , considerably aroused the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups in building up a new socialist Tibet , and will surely bring about a vigorous development to all undertakings in Tibet in the new century .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
Since the beginning of this year , our economy has continued to maintain a positive momentum of development .  This is a result of the fact that the central authorities keenly sensed the new changes in the world economy and , in good time , adopted a correct macroeconomic policy accordingly , and the whole nation worked as one in a down-to-earth manner .  It is also connected to the energetic endeavor to rectify and regulate the market economic order .  
The study activities have thus entered a new stage of assiduous study , conscientious pondering , organization of research on special topics , and firm implementation .  On 29 July , the central group for theoretical study of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee once again organized a study course to exchange what had been gained in the study , and all participants freely aired what they had learned from the study .  The atmosphere was lively throughout the study course .  
The meeting held that the present publicity reportage is powerful and dynamic and in line with the central spirit ; it has a clear keynote and plays a correct guiding role ; and it has publicized the main points of the " 1 July " speech and created a good atmosphere of public opinion .  
Practice has fully proved that the party 's third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core is the loyal and reliable successor to China 's socialist cause initiated by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and an energetic and promising pioneer .  
The theoretical study central group of the party group of the organs of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative studied once again Jiang Zemin 's " 1 July " important speech in a concentrated and thoroughgoing way in close connection with the realities in the CPPCC organs and implemented the spirit of the speech in real earnest .  
To profoundly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , the meeting decided to adopt several measures on the basis of study : first , the central group of the Central Discipline-Inspection Commission would set aside a period of time for carefully studying and discussing specific topics in Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , so as to achieve a profound understanding and accurate grasp of the spiritual essence .  
At the exhibition , more than 2,000 valuable pictures and 500 cultural relics , displayed in chronological sequence of historical development , vividly depicted the brilliant achievements scored by the people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying out revolution , reform , construction , and reform under the leadership of the party 's three generations of central collective leadership with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Raidi said : Successive Dalai Lamas first searched for a few candidates for a relevant reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals , before selecting one of them according to the ceremony of drawing lots from a golden urn and confirming the child after the approval of the central government .  Any act that runs counter to historical conventions and religious rituals would be regarded as invalid .  
the strong central leadership which is experienced and can have various complicated situations well in hand ; the correct line focusing on economic construction ; and the successful experience of handling well the relationship between reform on the one hand and development and stability on the other and of maintaining social stability , we are fully confident that our state will make further progress and our nation will prosper .  
According to sources , the central bank is really devoted to such vigorous investigation into and coping with the illegal operation of credit funds in the stock market , and it ordered such funds to be withdrawn within three months - - that is before end of September . The reason is that the high-ranking decision-makers in the central committee agreed upon and attached great importance to the matter .  
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
Xinjiang is located on the northwest edge of China , and it adjoins with eight nations on its periphery .  Xinjiang possesses abundant water , land , solar , and thermal resources , and abundant mineral resources ; it has already become the central location for the central committee 's implementation of its strategy of grand opening to the West .  
At 24:00 , we , through an internal channel , reported to the central leading authorities that , " according to preliminary investigations , 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident . "  
Members of the leading groups of the governments of various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central government for rectifying and standardizing the market economic order ; the major responsible persons of the various city and country governments ; and the responsible persons of relevant departments attended today 's conference at various branch venues .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .  
At 09��00 , Jiang Zemin and some other central leading comrades went to the Great Hall of the People to meet the delegates participating in the national working conference on comprehensive management of social order amid warm applause .  
High pressure should also be exerted on criminal offenders and lawbreakers .  The anti-crime campaign must achieve solid results and be carried out with great momentum , thus effectively deterring and frightening criminals and gratify the people , and guaranteeing that the objective of making marked improvements in the condition of law and order set forth by the central leadership will be smoothly achieved .  Second , great efforts should be made to improve routine public order maintenance and crime prevention .  
A source revealed : In accordance with the spirit of a central work meeting held in Beidaihe , the State Council has decided to introduce a series of new policies and measures aimed at stimulating domestic demand , including increasing personal consumption credit and loans , including those for purchasing residential units and cars , and speeding up input in infrastructure projects , and to urge the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] to approve on an earlier date , the issuance of 50-billion yuan of national bonds as well .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
Because of two decades ' rapid and steady economic growth , China 's combined national strength has grown remarkably , enabling it to increase its support for central and western parts of China .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
Relevant central officials held that the state should first establish guiding organs , formulate laws and regulations , and monitor and investigate illegal and harmful news reports .  The Internet institutions or service providers of non-information units will not be allowed to write or release their own news reports , nor is any website allowed to transmit media reports from abroad as well as from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan . Domestic websites are required to obtain approval before being registered abroad .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
The State Economic and Trade Commission has proposed to set up technological development centers in over 500 key enterprises , and more than two-thirds of the large and medium enterprises will strive to set up similar organizations within two to three years .  In the meantime , the technological innovative supporting systems geared to the needs of the medium and small enterprises will be set up in 30 central cities .  
The policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .  Army , armed police , procuratorial , judicial and public security organizations thoroughly broke off relations with their subsidiary enterprises while the work of breaking off relations between the central state organs and their subsidiary enterprises was basically implemented and progress was also made in the work of breaking off relations between the local Party and administrative organs and their subsidiary enterprises .  
He said : Since foreign capital shall be barred from news channels and the issue of jointly producing programs with foreign investors for certain professional channels has been placed on the agenda for discussion , all shall be temporarily suspended pending the introduction of policies and the local departments concerned shall be banned from holding discussions with foreign investors or conjecturing the central policies . 
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
- - He stressed holding cross-strait talks on an equal basis under the one-China principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "  He reiterated that conditions for Taiwan can be more liberal than those for Hong Kong and Macao , that is , a high degree of autonomy ; the mainland will not send troops and officials to Taiwan ; Taiwan 's judicial powers will be completely independent ; Taiwan will have the power of final adjudication ; Taiwan can completely retain its original party , administrative , and military systems ;  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
Addressing a group discussion held by the Inner Mongolia delegation on the afternoon of 5 March , Buhe , vice chairman of the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee , said : Premier Zhu Rongji 's government work report stressed the strategy of actively developing west China and the issues of expeditiously developing central and west China . This is an important and very popular policy decision .  It has a strategic significance whereby if we can properly accomplish this task , other regions will also be invigorated .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
The numerous opinions put forward in June 1999 , when the NPC Standing Committee deliberated over the final central financial account and the central financial audit report for 1998 , were the reasons why the reform was started officially .  However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
Ministry budgetary planning implies that China 's budgetary planning is gradually going on to the scientific , systemized , and standardized track , and the openness , fair , just , and other special qualities that the budgetary planning should posses , as well as the transparency in central budget , will also be improved and increased further .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
A source disclosed that the mainland 's Taiwan Work Department and experts engaged in Taiwan research work have carried out intensive consultations over the past week .  After smoothing out internal differences , a common understanding was reached at the meeting of the chairmen of the Taiwan Affairs Office that closed last week ; that is , the principle of taking economic construction as the central task will not be forsaken .  Efforts made to develop the domestic economy and increase overall national strength will be the powerful foundation for eventually settling the Taiwan issue .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
In his speech , Zhang Bolin said : The changes in the principal leaders of the State Sports General Bureau were decided by the party central leadership for the purpose of promoting cadre exchanges to meet the actual needs in enhancing the leading body .  The decision was based on giving consideration to the general situation and was a normal change in the organizational work .  
The central leadership holds that the appointments of new principal leaders to the State Sports General Bureau are proper , and the new leaders can support each other with their own strong points .  Zhang Bolin also put forward some requirements for the future work of the State Sports General Bureau : Enhance the sense of political responsibility , continue to advance the reform and development of sports ; consolidate and expand the results of " three stress " education , do a good job in party building and contingent building ;  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
Because of two decades ' rapid and steady economic growth , China 's combined national strength has grown remarkably , enabling it to increase its support for central and western parts of China .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
Relevant central officials held that the state should first establish guiding organs , formulate laws and regulations , and monitor and investigate illegal and harmful news reports .  The Internet institutions or service providers of non-information units will not be allowed to write or release their own news reports , nor is any website allowed to transmit media reports from abroad as well as from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan . Domestic websites are required to obtain approval before being registered abroad .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
The State Economic and Trade Commission has proposed to set up technological development centers in over 500 key enterprises , and more than two-thirds of the large and medium enterprises will strive to set up similar organizations within two to three years .  In the meantime , the technological innovative supporting systems geared to the needs of the medium and small enterprises will be set up in 30 central cities .  
The policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .  Army , armed police , procuratorial , judicial and public security organizations thoroughly broke off relations with their subsidiary enterprises while the work of breaking off relations between the central state organs and their subsidiary enterprises was basically implemented and progress was also made in the work of breaking off relations between the local Party and administrative organs and their subsidiary enterprises .  
He said : Since foreign capital shall be barred from news channels and the issue of jointly producing programs with foreign investors for certain professional channels has been placed on the agenda for discussion , all shall be temporarily suspended pending the introduction of policies and the local departments concerned shall be banned from holding discussions with foreign investors or conjecturing the central policies . 
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
- - He stressed holding cross-strait talks on an equal basis under the one-China principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "  He reiterated that conditions for Taiwan can be more liberal than those for Hong Kong and Macao , that is , a high degree of autonomy ; the mainland will not send troops and officials to Taiwan ; Taiwan 's judicial powers will be completely independent ; Taiwan will have the power of final adjudication ; Taiwan can completely retain its original party , administrative , and military systems ;  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
Addressing a group discussion held by the Inner Mongolia delegation on the afternoon of 5 March , Buhe , vice chairman of the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee , said : Premier Zhu Rongji 's government work report stressed the strategy of actively developing west China and the issues of expeditiously developing central and west China . This is an important and very popular policy decision .  It has a strategic significance whereby if we can properly accomplish this task , other regions will also be invigorated .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
The numerous opinions put forward in June 1999 , when the NPC Standing Committee deliberated over the final central financial account and the central financial audit report for 1998 , were the reasons why the reform was started officially .  However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
Ministry budgetary planning implies that China 's budgetary planning is gradually going on to the scientific , systemized , and standardized track , and the openness , fair , just , and other special qualities that the budgetary planning should posses , as well as the transparency in central budget , will also be improved and increased further .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .

Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
Chengdu , Chongqing , and other central cities in the west have issued a series of regulations abolishing previous limitations on holding concurrent jobs .  This allows technical personnel at work units who have completed their jobs to hold another job concurrently at another unit , under the precondition of not infringing on the patented technology of the nation or the unit or their economic interests .  More jobs means more salary .  
Under the new circumstance , it is the military academies ' central task to cultivate new-type and high-quality military talents , who have comprehensive and excellent development in aspects such as ideological and political building , scientific and cultural building , military profession , and physical and psychological strength , and are endowed with comprehensive knowledge and talents as well as the spirit and ability to make initiative .  
It is reported that Guangzhou City held a national defense mobilization meeting last month .  Huang Huahua , secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC Committee , chaired the meeting in his capacity as the first political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region . He called on the relevant quarters in the city to seriously do good preparatory work for military struggle in the new period in accordance with the central authorities ' arrangements .  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Since we have consistently attached importance to and persistently grasped ideological and political work as the central link , the central policy decision has deeply penetrated into people 's minds , and this has effectively eliminated interference in ideological understanding , mobilized the activism and initiative of all sectors , formed a powerful spiritual motive force for impelling the work , and ensured the smooth implementation of the central policy decision .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
The meeting maintained that in light of the bumper harvests of grain for many years in a row and the phased situation of supply exceeding demand , the party 's central committee and the State Council have formulated a series of powerful policies and measures , particularly the one to promote grain circulation structural reform with stress on the " three policies and one reform , " and attained remarkable results .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central authorities , various localities and departments concerned have accelerated the structural adjustment of agriculture and grain production , persisted in procuring peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices without restriction , increased the intensity of selling grain at favorable prices , tightened the management of grain purchasing funds and grain markets , and pushed forward the reform of grain procuring and marketing enterprises .  
Practice has fully proven that the central policies on grain reform are entirely correct and have played an important role in protecting peasants ' enthusiasm for grain production , giving impetus to agricultural structural adjustment , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , and maintaining social stability .  
The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;  
In order to suit the changes in the domestic and international markets and meet with the challenges of the WTO entry , various localities must act according to the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important instructions on quickening technological advancement , conscientiously put into effect the guidelines of the fourth plenary session of the 15th party 's central committee , and carry out the work of technical innovation in a thoroughgoing way to promote the adjustment , optimization , and upgrading of the economic structure as a whole .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
With the support of the central authorities and fraternal provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , the vast numbers of cadres and people of all nationalities across Xinjiang will be self-reliant , will struggle in unity , and will build an economically prosperous , socially stable , and ethnically united Xinjiang that has beautiful mountains and rivers .

People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .  It seized narcotics , banned the planting of opium poppies , closed opium halls , sternly punished narcotics producing and trafficking activities , punished over 80,000 narcotics-related criminal elements , forced 20 million drug addicts to quit drug addiction , and eradicated opium poppy planting in conjunction with rural land reform .  
Under the present new international and domestic situations , further doing a good job of cultivating and selecting minority cadres is of still greater importance to implementing the guidelines of the 15th national party congress and the central nationality work meeting , putting into effect Comrade Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " smashing the Western hostile forces ' political conspiracy of " Westernizing " and " dividing " China , accelerating the implementation of the large-scale western development , and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
As for the so-called administrative monopolies , precisely as analyzed by the scholars of the State Council 's Development Research Center , with the vigorous support by a series of preferential policies by the state and nurtured by enormous investments over a long period of time , China 's rail transport , communications , electric power , coal and gas , running water , and numerous other infrastructure industries grew rapidly , and furthermore they were mainly enterprises invested in by the central or local governments which were operated as institutional monopolies .  
A great era , magnificent goals , and arduous tasks set demands on us to firmly grasp the central link of the ideological education work .  All are urged to make this central ideological and political work conference a new starting point and a fresh motive force , and to do even better , down-to-earth , and effective ideological and political work .  
( 14 ) All levels of local Party committees and people 's governments , relevant departments of the central and state organs , and mass organizations have to take teenage students ' extracurricular education work and the building and management work of venues for teenage students ' activities as an important matter , and approach it from the high plane of implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the country with science , technology and education and pushing ahead with the building of two civilizations , and with the attitude of being highly responsible for the Party and the people .

Speaking of the central financial expenditure in 1999 in terms of both allocation and use , Xiang stated : Our central financial expenditure has conscientiously implemented and carried out both the strategic arrangements laid down by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision made by the Second Session of the Ninth NPC and has played a positive role in promoting sustained , rapid , or healthy national economic development ; in pressing ahead with a deep-going reform in the state-owned enterprises ; in attaining the goal of shaking off poverty ;  
Xiang Huaicheng said : China made major achievements in various national economic and social undertakings in 1999 .  The final accounts of central and local governments were rather good , with central financial revenue continuing to maintain a fine growth momentum .  
Part of that , 191.053 billion yuan , was used to repay the principal and interest of internal and external debts ; 179.16 billion yuan was spent reducing the deficit for the year ; and the remaining 1.29 billion yuan was used to replenish the central fiscal sinking fund .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : The fiscal revenue at the central level in 1999 increased by 95.721 billion yuan over the previous year , accounting for 61 percent of the increment in the total national fiscal revenue .  It not only enabled the proportion of the national fiscal revenue in the GDP to continue on a rising curve , from 12.4 percent in 1998 to 13.9 percent in 1999 , but also increased the proportion of the central fiscal revenue in the national fiscal revenue from 49.5 percent in 1998 to 51.1 percent in 1999 .  
Regarding the arrangement for , and use of , the central fiscal expenditure , Xiang Huaicheng said : In the area of central fiscal expenditure , we have conscientiously implemented the strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision of the second session of the Ninth NPC .  It has played a positive role in such areas as promoting the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy ; helping state enterprises intensify their reforms ;

The election of Tung Chee-hwa was widely acclaimed by people at home and abroad as well as by people of the central government and the international community .  Hong Kong residents also are happy to have such a person as their chief executive .  
The meeting maintained that the Central Ideological and Political Work Meeting is an important meeting held at the historic moment of our party in its advance toward the new century , and also a major move of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core which adheres to the strategic principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both " for promoting the cause of reform , opening up , and modernization in a comprehensive way .  
The central authorities repeatedly stressed that the rate of progress should be subordinated to quality .  Stressing the importance of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) is , in essence , determined by the specific important position of counties ( cities ) , and by the condition of the leading bodies and the rank of leading cadres at this level .  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Auditing Administration conducted the audit and did a tremendous amount work on the execution of the 1999 central budget and other fiscal income and expenditure as well as the management and utilization of the 1998 state bonds special funds , thereby playing an active supervisory role in safeguarding the state financial and economic order .  
The results of the auditing show that in general the tasks in executing the 1999 central budget and managing and utilizing the state bonds special funds have been carried out well .  However , malpractices and unlawful and criminal activities are grave in the current financial and economic sphere , and some existing problems in the central budget management should not be ignored .  
A source pointed out that as a " breach " set by the central authorities in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises , the textile industry has not only made a turnaround one year ahead of time but has also yielded good economic returns in the first half of the year .

All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
Wu Yi pointed out at the same time that confronted with the accelerated development of various countries in the world and the situation of increasingly keen competition , central and local departments at all levels in charge of foreign economic relations and trade must maintain a sober mind , follow the situation closely , analyze the difficulties and uncertain factors that they may encounter in work calmly and objectively , adopt effective measures in good time , and make great efforts to maintain the development momentum of various foreign trade business operations .  
It is noteworthy that China experienced economic overheating from 1992 to 1993 .  From the summer of 1993 , the central authorities intensified and improved macroeconomic regulation and control , gradually cooling down economic overheating .  GDP growth was down from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 13.5 percent in 1993 , 12.6 percent in 1994 , 10.5 percent in 1995 , and 9.6 percent in 1996 .  
To avoid the possible economic downturn and to maintain sustained rapid healthy national economic development , the central authorities have resolutely made major policy decisions to expand domestic demand and implement the proactive fiscal policy .  
In light of the new situation of economic operations in 1999 , the central authorities continued to implement the proactive fiscal policy and , on the basis of the planned long-term treasury bond issue worth 50 billion yuan , further issued 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds . 
This year additional treasury bonds worth 100 billion yuan were issued and listed in the budget at the start of the year .  While further accelerating infrastructure construction , the central authorities have intensified business technological renovation ; promoted technological advance and industrial upgrades ;  
While inspecting the Urumqi-Kuitun Freeway , Ismail Amat pointed out : By standing high , seeing far , and facing up to a new century , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has made such a wise decision as to implement a strategy of developing the western regions on a large scale , this being also a strategic arrangement made by the central authorities for speeding up the development of the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities .  
Judging from China 's economic development since 1993 , the central authorities have become more mature in macroeconomic regulation and control .  In addition to accumulating rich experience in controlling inflation , China has gained initial experience in vigorously checking the deflation trend .

In accordance with the unified plans of the central authorities regarding the launching in the rural areas of in-depth educational activities based on the important " three represents " idea , we must organize grass-roots cadres in studying and understanding the central authorities ' policies concerning the reduction of the burden on peasants , enhance their policy awareness and legal mindedness , improve their work style , and boost their initiative in implementing the policies .  
The average per-capita amount of grain was less than 300 jin .  Faced with difficult natural conditions , the masses of cadres and people in Bazhong , earnestly implementing the policies set by the central authorities , have enormously changed the impoverished feature of Bazhong after eight years of unremitting efforts .  
First , it is necessary to link such activities with developing the rural economy and guiding farmers to free themselves from poverty and achieve a better-off level of moderate prosperity .  It is necessary to firmly instill grass-roots cadres in rural areas with the idea of taking economic development as the central task and to make them concentrate their energy on developing the rural economy and on raising farmers ' incomes .  
The spokesman said that under Section 2 of the Ordinance , the legal advice is that the definition of " reclamation " if given its widest literal effect , would create an unrealistic situation in which even the approval for repair of a cable laid on the seabed , or the routine maintenance of facilities within the geographical boundary of the central harbour , would be subject to the " presumption against reclamation " principle .  
" Given the sheer size of the public and private sector foreign currency debts of the affected economies , the role of the international lender of last resort can not be fulfilled by the IMF or any single central bank without the participation of the private sector , " said Mr Yam .  
Prompt disease notification , proper statistical analysis and interpretation , coupled with timely data dissemination , are essential components of an effective surveillance system which is central to the control of the spread of infectious diseases in our community .  
During visits to Frankfurt , Munich , The Hague and Amsterdam , the Financial Secretary held fruitful and frank discussions with a wide audience which included central bankers and leading bank chiefs , finance ministers and government officials , industrialists and business executives as well as several think-tanks and academic research groups .  
Looking ahead , Mr Cooper set out the Land Registry 's vision for the future which is to establish by 2001 a fully computerised and integrated land registration and search system that will offer convenient , speedy and cost-effective services , including central registration , guaranteed land title and a ' one-stop ' search service without geographic restrictions .  
Nothing else is more important .  Good education is central to developing the potential of our children so that they will learn to think independently and creatively , become mindful of social changes , and be equipped with the knowledge and skills which enable them to play an active role and a positive role in our society .  
Readers of the Provisional Urban Council 's public libraries can now borrow audio compact discs from central and district libraries , a spokesman for the Council announced today ( Monday ) .  " The new lending service is part of the Council 's effort to provide better library services , " said the spokesman .  The Council 's central and district libraries keep a wide variety of titles in audio compact disc format including classical music , popular songs , folk songs , Cantonese operatic songs and children 's stories .  
He together with 19 Hong Kong based officers are tasked to build a very crucial bridge to link up the CPG and the provincial / municipal authorities in the Mainland with the HKSARG . I sincerely look forward to the generous support of the central leadership , State and Provincial officials to this new Office , to help it establish its work on a sound foundation . 
This is a challenging enough task for the highly trained staff in central banks of developed economies , who generally benefit from dealing with a relatively stable economic structure and from considerable experience in monetary management under floating exchange rates .  
( b ) of the numbers of conferences on investment policies and trade , as well as trade missions for foreign enterprises based in Hong Kong , that had been arranged respectively by the Industry Department and the TDC in collaboration with the central and local organisations in the Mainland over the past three years ; the number of projects for developing business and making investments in the Mainland by the enterprises concerned , which were finalised through such promotional efforts , and the industries and investment amounts involved in those projects ; and  
( iii ) If a parent does not apply for a discretionary place and opts to join the central allocation arranged by the ED , he is required to submit to the ED in person an " Application Form for Admission to Primary One " , bringing along documentary proof of the reported residential address ( as set out in part ( ii ) above ) .  
In federations , such as the United States of America , Australia and Canada , legislative power is divided between the central and regional governments .  Almost invariably , the central government is empowered to legislate on a wide range of subject matters , and the powers of regional governments are restricted .  
Some are monumental in size , many are standing figures , and the most impressive format is the stele with one central Buddha and two attendant Bodhisattvas . Some fragments of figures are also included to show the prevalent artistic style .  
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said : " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
The annual meeting was attended by over 200 senior officials from central banks , financial regulatory bodies , and legal , financial and law enforcement agencies of member and observer jurisdictions , as well as representatives from international and regional organisations , including the Asian Development Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the United Nations and the World Customs Organization .  
Prompt notifications and control measures , proper statistical analysis and interpretation , coupled with timely data dissemination , continue to be the essential components of an effective infectious disease surveillance system , which is central to the control of the spread of infectious diseases in our community .  
These include red filtering glass and special sun shading louvres used to reduce the need for air-conditioning ; grey water recycling facilities , water saving taps and sanitary fittings used to cut down on water consumption ; and bio-metric system that recognizes personal unique features such as fingerprint , iris and intelligent central services .  
As for the longer-term challenges , Mr Tung said that central to our policy thinking and activities was how we could as a society best make the transition to a knowledge economy from our current starting point in the shortest time possible , ride the waves of progress of China with the greatest success and least economic and human dislocations , and adapt ourselves to the era of globalised competition and in the end come up with an economy that can perform brilliantly in the most demanding and competitive situations .  
Looking ahead , we will further develop the depth and width of our bond market .  We are forging the bilateral linkage with Euroclear with a view to promoting cross-boundary custody and clearing of Hong Kong and overseas bonds , and at the same time expanding the base of investors , thereby stimulating the growth of both local and regional bond markets .  We will also develop our CMU into an international clearing house , so that Hong Kong will become the central clearing house in Asia . This will strengthen our status as an international financial centre .  
The general planning intention of the area is to conserve the intrinsic natural character of the scenic hilly landscape on the western and northern parts , to promote recreation and productive agriculture on the valley floors , to upgrade the obsolete and sub-standard housing in the central and southern parts , and to maintain the character and intensity of the residential developments in the area .  
" Hong Kong 's proximity to Mainland China and its leading cities ; its central location in Asia ; its position as world 's leading business and finance center ; its state-of-art infrastructure ; its independent judiciary ; its rule of law ; low and simple tax regime as well as its level-playing field for all are the distinctive advantages available in Hong Kong for overseas investors , " said Mr Rowse .  
In announcing the results , Professor Chan said , " These figures are the result of a survey of the pay trends in the private companies .  Pay adjustment for the civil service is , however , a separate matter ; the actual level of adjustment will have to be determined by the Administration in consultation with the four central staff consultative councils . "  
The Secretary for the Civil Service , Mr . Joseph W P Wong , today ( May 22 ) announced that the Chief Executive in Council decided to offer to the staff sides of the four central consultative councils that civil service pay be reduced by 4.42 per cent for the directorate and the upper salary band , 1.64 per cent for the middle salary band and 1.58 per cent for the lower salary band with effect from October 1 , 2002 .  
On better use of advanced technologies , Mr Tang said , " We have developed a comprehensive Intelligent Transport System ( ITS ) strategy which comprises two main elements - the Transport Information System ( TIS ) which provides a central database for easy and efficient access by Government departments , transport operators and the public ; and a Traffic Management Framework ( TMF ) which puts all existing traffic control functions under a coordinated central command . "  
In the past 24 months , I have had regular meetings with the staff sides of the central consultative councils , and held discussion sessions with major staff associations on important policy reviews .  I have also visited one department every week on average to keep in touch with departmental staff associations and frontline staff , and written to individual colleagues whenever there are matters of their concern .  
Back in 1996 , the Working Group on Occupational Safety and Health in the Civil Service was set up by the Civil Service Bureau , comprising members from the four central consultative councils , with the objective of motivating joint efforts of the management and staff sides to inculcate an occupational safety and health ( OSH ) culture in the civil service and enhance civil servants ' awareness of the subject through various educational and publicity programmes .  
In the Chinese history , the Qin and Han dynasties were crucial eras which marked the emergence of China 's basic territorial boundaries , the establishment of the first government of central administration and a unified empire , the expansion of communications with the West , and the development of production technologies .  In the 2,200 years from the establishment of governance systems in those two dynasties to the period immediately before the Revolution of 1911 , China developed steadily on a set trail politically , socially , economically and culturally .  
This was due largely to the development of an El Nino in the year , which was characterised by above normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific . The associated change in atmospheric steering flow caused tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific to turn towards the north before entering the South China Sea . 
" From 7 pm to 9 pm , the extent of the traffic ban will be enlarged to cover all central harbour .  Vessels , other than excepted vessels , will be prohibited from entering or remaining in the Restricted Area , which is bounded on the east by a line joining Hung Hom Railway Station Cargo Pier and the breakwater at Kellett Island of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club , and on the west by a line joining the southwest extremity of the Ocean Terminal and the Central Government Pier .  
( c ) HA has set up an independent team comprising a senior consultant surgeon and executives from the HA Head Office to establish a central registry for liver transplant by merging the two existing waiting lists separately maintained by QMH and PWH .  
At about 11.45pm , the officers intercepted an outgoing lorry declared to be empty .  After conducting a thorough examination , the officers found 237 central processing units and 648 hard disks , worth a total of $ 620,000 , inside a false compartment on the underside of the vehicle .  
In fact , although the spotlight tends , quite understandably , to be on newsworthy issues - bank rescues , intervention in the stock market , the latest Exchange Fund results , the " alarming " strengthening of the Hong Kong dollar - much of the work of any central bank has to be focused on the longer term , on the implementation of sustainable , consistent , dependable policies on a horizon that lies well beyond the daily concerns of most of us .  
The main challenges in central banking are to maintain a monetary and banking environment that is optimal for stable and sustainable economic growth , and , particularly in the case of present-day Hong Kong , an environment that is conducive to resolving our current problems .  
Premier Sun informed the participants that in handling " this regrettable affair , " the government has been most concerned , and has carefully followed the rule of protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . The incident has in no way affected the central administration 's determination to implement democratic and constitutional government .  
Story of a Small Town Mountains covered with fir woods and bamboo groves , frequently shrouded by mists and sharply divided by the sparkling Chingshui River , provide an idyllic setting for Tsaoling Village in central Taiwan . Its pastoral people , who earn their living through a resourceful array of specialized products , help further to induce an atmosphere of rural peace .  
He made special efforts to improve diving flashlights . The existing models were big and clumsy , and he wanted both lighter weight and greater utility . He redesigned the lamp at the front of the flashlight so that light could come out the side of the flashlight , and made a detachable red cover for the central portion of the lamp , to change the flashlight into a distress signal .  
Its fruit , however , has earned a place in the hearts and appetites of Chinese everywhere for its many gastronomic and medicinal uses . On Taiwan , the plant thrives best from the region south of Chiayi , in central Taiwan . Originally grown for personal consumption , farmers grew the hardy ling chiao in fishponds .  
The excited archeologists discovered that this trail was part of a lengthy road that traversed the central mountain range from the Chushan area in the west , to Yuli , near Hualien in the east . The total distance the trail covered was 120 kilometers . Known as Pat'ungkung in the native aboriginal dialect , the road was constructed during the reign of the Ching dynasty emperor Kuang Hsu ( also known as Teh Tsung , 1875-1908 ) .  
A city with a diverse and rich history finds itself regaining some of its former grandeur and majesty . The road will not be easy for Chang Hua and her 200,000 inhabitants , but the new mayor is determined to bring back the past in order to enter the future . Chang Hua is situated in the central part of Taiwan where traditions change slowly , matching the pace of life there .  
The economy is represented by the bird , free to fly wherever it likes in an area bounded by the cage , which symbolizes the central plan . According to Wei Ai of the Institute of International Relations , " This means all changes will be made in a communist framework . Inflation and misguided investment they 'll be able to solve perhaps as they go , but there will still be problems they never anticipated . "  
People from points south flocked there to do business , making it second only to P'ingtung itself as a commercial center . The town became the central market for farmers to sell their red beans , betel nuts , coconuts , and other local specialities , from where they were sold wholesale to other markets .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
In time to come , it will be comparable in size to the central commercial sectors of Taichung and Tainan . And the volume of economic activity in Hsinchu 's commercial sector will increase more than threefold . ( 4 ) Hsiang Shan Mountain City will become a scenic residential district .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
The Center held to this central concept throughout the process of finding and selecting a site , deciding on New York , laying out a budget , starting construction and finallyreparing the interior . " It was an incredibly complex , painstaking task that is actually of little interest to anyone who was n't directly involved , " as Director of the New York News and Culture Center Chang Min-chih puts it .  
" In fact the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and high foreign exchange reserves are not directly or necessarily linked with speculative fever or inflation . What is important is looking at how policy in the financial markets is carried out and supporting their stability , " says Lu Fang-ching , deputyexecutive secretary of the Commodity Price Supervisory Board at the Ministry of Economic Affairs examining the problem from another angle . " The point is that the central bank , compared to five years ago , is more experienced and very cautious . "  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
Last year the Amei River , located to the east of the Hsiu-kuluan River , and which originates in the Coastal Mountain Range , flooded over because of excessive silt buildup downstream . This year , the central , provincial , and county governments are preparing to spend NT $ 100 million to deal with this tiny , lessthan-10-kilometer-long stream .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
Using a needle to implant silicone is fast and cheap and is a classic example of a technique that neither requires surgery nor leaves scars . It was an immediate hit . There are records of women from central and southern Taiwan coming north on chartered tour buses for " head-to-foot " plastic surgery .  
People who have disabilities within the following categories : impaired vision ; impaired hearing or balance ; speech or linguistic impediments ; bodily disabilities ; learning disabilities ; multiple disabilities ; malfunction of important internal organs ; facial deformities and wounds ; coma or senile dementia ; autism ; others ( as defined by the central authorities ) .  
Because the fashionable nineteenth-century top per required the use of mercury for stiffening its felt so it would stand up straight , factory workers would come into frequent contact with the metal . They would often suffer from a damaged central nervous system , loss of speech control , impaired vision and the ability to move .  
However , ailments such as cadmium , lead and mercury induced damage to the central nervous system , sterility and deformities , impairment of the immune system , damage to the respiratory system , liver poisoning and irreversible chronic poisoning are all on the rise . In relation to the chemical substances that are increasingly coming to permeate our daily lives , people are gradually coming to realize the risks they face from heavy metals .  
In " An Open Letter to Our Compatriots on Taiwan , " delivered in 1979 before the National People 's Congress by standing central committee member Ye Jianying , the Communists declared that they would cease shelling Kinmen , Matsu and other offshore islands and would set up navigation and postal links as soon as possible to facilitate direct contacts between the two sides and carry out acade mic and cultural exchange .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Toxological studies have shown that heavy metal poisoning damages every system of the body . Inacute poisoning , ingested heavy metals cause clear damage to the digestive system , producing nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , colic or melanosis . Inhaled in the lungs , they can cause necrotic bronchitis , tuberculosis or pneumoatothorax . In chronic poisoning , the central nervous system and the hematopoietic system are especially sensitive .  
In fact , in one famous district in central Taiwan , a builder once advertised that a building would be equipped with cold storage for garbage , only to find that once the building was completed , the residents were unwilling to foot the extra electricity charge .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level . The lower levels of government had no basis for making objections .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
In terms of election demands , as the climate grew more open opinions of every political color were aired , and later the same year the DPP 's central standing committee passed its " Draft Constitution for Taiwan , " and proposed " founding an independent country . " The KMT , seizing on Taiwan 's middle classes ' collective fear of disorder and desire for stability , defined its position as one of " renewal , stability and prosperity , " while lambasting the DPP as the party of " violence and revolution . "  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan . Here they extended their experience in pioneering harsh and demanding terrain , and their characteristic traits were passed down from generation to generation .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
With their characteristic outline gone and their bodies covered by a tarpaulin which leaves only half their heads exposed , although the sharks ' teeth are still sharp , their eyes are sunken and they are no longer frightening . There they will wait until night , when lorries arrive to take them for auction at Taipei 's central market , ending their landward journey .  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
In the center of the long hanging scroll stand a mountain and trees . They have an imposing grandeur , yet are upright and balanced about a vertical central axis , unmoved by any wind . So although there are mountain pines on myriad peaks , where is the soughing wind ?  
Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult .

The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Juju Wang , an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Tsing Hua University , notes that all of the central government agencies are located up north in Taipei . The city has two-thirds of the island 's universities , over 90 percent of the corporate headquarters , and over 90 percent of its media . The magnetic draw of Taipei has made it an over-loaded city with a deteriorating environment - " a poor place to live amid great wealth . "  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
Sitting in the central hall , with the Lotus Flower Pool and Mt . Kuanyin in front of you and the rear courtyard and the ancestral memorial tablet behind , nestled between sky and earth , mountain and river , amid the deepening twilight , a sense of the eternity of the ancestors and yourself will flood through your body , as myriad thoughts of extraordinary people and times past well up into your mind .  
The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
In 1930 , aborigines in the area of Wushe stormed a sports day at the local school , killing over 100 Japanese , including policemen and teachers . The motivation for the attack was anger at Japan 's repressive policies for " governing the barbarians , " by which the authorities endeavored to requisition territory and exploit the forestry resources of Taiwan 's central highlands . Under these policies , the culture and traditional ways of life of aboriginal tribes were effectively outlawed , and those that resisted were massacred .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
In fact , I 'm furious with it , but what can I do ? " The leaders of 23 local governments signed a petition demanding that the central government allocate still more of the Tax Redistribution Fund to them . " The petition was immediately supported by everyone , regardless of party affiliation , and regardless of whether they were on Taiwan proper or its outlying islands . "  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January . Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .  
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside . But the hundred-pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan . It grows to one-and-a-half meters or more-much the same length as the habu and cobra-but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University . Motivated by a deep interest in Taiwanese history , during the late 1980s Lan began to work for Ren Jian Magazine , whose main mission was to bring to light hidden aspects of society . As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
The main offerings to Lu 's spirit were the " five treasures of the artisan " ( various measuring devices , markers , and tools ) , while artworks were set on every table as additional offerings . The seriousness with which the ritual was taken is evidenced by the fact that a central government official-Council for Cultural Affairs vice chairman Liu Wann-hong-served as master of ceremonies , with the Changhua County executive and the mayor of Lukang as his seconds .  
The emergence of the cross-platform " central editorial desk " has also created a trend for convergence of various personnel previously scattered in different fields such as the visual media , print media and technology firms . Phenomena such as magazine editors operating web sites and publishing their own electronic newspapers , or the China Times investing in Power TV to enable readers of the paper 's electronic edition to watch direct transmissions of the station 's world news online at any time , are becoming more and more common .  
Most observers of the 2002 elections believe that in the past the DPP could count on the firm support of 30-40% of grassroots voters , but they are watching with keen interest to see whether this support base will be as solid this time round , following the transfer of central government power to the DPP and the political upheavals of the last two years .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Ching Ching Farm in central Taiwan is also driving local economic growth . It offers activities like getting up-close with the sheep herd there , and there is also the attraction of nearby peach and apple orchards . Nearby , not only are there rows of restaurants opened by locals , but even the international chains 7-11 and Starbucks coffee houses have opened outlets , leading to a perfect fusion of the romance of the sheep ranch with the consumer habits of the visitors .  
According to Zhang , the classic forms of the wuxia , or wandering swordsman , genre of Chinese film have already been defined . There are , for example , King Hu 's gentle and even feminine Zen-flavored aesthetics ; Chang Cheh 's tough exteriors that hide gentle hearts ; and even Ang Lee 's evocation of the boldness coupled with restraint central to Chinese culture . Zhang did n't want to replicate any of these , so in Hero he set out to define a new wuxia aesthetic .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
On September 13 , the Ministry of Education held the National Education Development Conference . At the conference , the central topic for higher education was " Promoting the Quality of Higher Education to Raise International Competitiveness . " The stated objective was to have a local university enter the ranks of the world 's top hundred universities within ten years , and have at least ten key academic departments or inter-institution research centers ranked first in Asia in their respective categories .  
Wu Wei-ting points out that in the past feminist groups mostly talked to the media , but did n't do much to relate to real women at the grass-roots level . Thus , when New Awakening held a series of seminars in northern , central , and southern Taiwan on property rights of husbands and wives , you could tell the large gap between city and country from the reception they received from the audience .  
" Setting down roots and deepening our impact is the real hard job , " says Yu Mei-nu . To help close the gap between town and country , two years ago they began organizing women 's groups in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan to create the NUTWA , to create a platform for information and resource sharing . They are now moving to use the Internet to link women 's groups across the island .  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Its towering presence is beyond the power of words to describe . Additionally , the summit provides a panoramic view of the main sources of water that nourish the land . The Nantsaihsien River and Laonung River are the sources of southern Taiwan 's Kaoping River ; the Chenyoulan River , largest tributary of central Taiwan 's Choshui River , winds its way to the northwest ; and the valley of the Lakulaku River , which feeds eastern Taiwan 's Hsiukuluan River , is also visible in the distance .  
" Players living in Taiwan have always been pretty keen to represent their country , " says Chinese Taipei head coach Hsu Sheng-ming . " Players who take the top three spots on the team can earn exemption from military service and a substantial award from the central government . In addition to these practical matters , in every stage of training the players are instilled with strong ideas about pursuing honor for their country . "  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

As the maritime point of entry and exit for northern Taiwan , Keelung was able ( thanks in part to intense lobbying by local government and elected officials ) to gain central government approval despite its currently having only 68 hectares of available land . The FTZ there is set to begin operating in late September this year .  
Boosted by record low interest rates since the beginning of the year , an atmosphere of optimism surrounds the real estate market throughout Taiwan . Offers ranging from upmarket homes in Taipei City , to townhouses in central and southern Taiwan with ads touting 100% financing , have stirred awake many people 's long-silent itch to buy .  
During previous typhoons , after a flood release from the reservoir , it was always possible to wait a few days for the river water to clear up and start providing potable water again . But this time people were not so lucky . Six or seven days after Aere the turbidity of the water remained high , leading to Taoyuan being declared a disaster area due to a severe water shortage , and a war of words broke out between local and central authorities over responsibility .  
This typhoon caused the people of Taoyuan a great deal of pain and suffering as they were forced to go without water for many days . Industrial losses are estimated at NT $ 10 billion . Heads of agencies at the local and central government level are exhausted by their efforts . The chairman and the CEO of Taiwan Water Corporation stepped down , and there was a strong reaction among the corporation 's employees .

In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .  
Typhoon Herb 's furious assault on central Taiwan in 1996 provoked waves of criticism of the overexploitation of hillside land areas . In view of social trends and the impact of Taiwan 's future accession to the WTO , it was decided that the NTU farm would switch to eco-experience tours and environmental education : thus was born the " Meifeng Eco-Experience Camp . "  
The area was once central Taiwan 's main aquacultural center , with all kinds of fish being raised there . Traders would come from around the island to strike deals with the local farmers , who did double duty as their own wholesalers . For a while , trade was brisk , but over recent decades the industry has been on the decline , and is now of little real note . Already it seems like people are forgetting this important part of Taiwan 's history .  
He said that the central government has always attached importance to the role of overseas Chinese , who are patriotic and have deep feelings for the motherland They have played a special role in pushing forward the motherland 's economic development , supporting the disaster relief work and promoting the reunification of the motherland  
ji made specific explanations on the relations between the central authorities and the macao special administrative region , basic rights and obligations of macao residents , the political system , and economic , cultural and social affairs stipulated in the draft basic law of the macao special administrative region  
elected deputy to the fifth and seventh npc , vice chairman of the standing committee of seventh npc , and chairman of financial and economic committee of npc elected member of the cpc 10th 14th central committee and alternative member of the political bureau of cpc 11th and 12th central committee  
In June last year , the China Financial Certification Center , sponsored by the central bank and composed of 12 commercial banks , was established Under the coordination of the central bank , China is speeding up national credit card integration , and the integration is expected to be completed among large and medium sized cities by 2003  
despite a busy daily schedule for him at the party central committee secretariat , wen jiabao has retained a strong interest in natural sciences and economic matters , following developments closely , collecting relevant data and producing analytical reports  
Dominique Casier , FBA chairman and chief representative of the Beijing Office of the General Bank of Belgium , told the conference that foreign financial institutions are interested in Henan 's economic construction and in developing other central and western areas  
each deputy received four ballots in red , apricot yellow , pink and light yellow colors , used to vote respectively for the chairman , vice chairmen and secretary general of the npc standing committee members of the npc standing committee the president and vice president of prc and the chairman of prc central military commission  
To be efficient , public expenditure planning needs a coherent macroeconomic framework in which the institutional capability is shared between the ministries of finance and planning , the central bank and the statistical office .  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
For the purposes of advisory services and technical assistance , the term " national institution " is interpreted flexibly to mean any body which is established by a Government to play a central role in the domestic human rights situation .

At present , of the 140 kinds of proven mineral deposits of the country , over 120 are in the central and western region and the deposits of some rare metals there rank first in the country .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
After summing up the situation in reviewing the " three stresses " educational work of the previous stage , Zhang Quanjing pointed out : The central authorities have decided to conduct a " review " campaign after concluding the centralized " three stresses " education .  This is an important move for further consolidating and expanding the achievements in the " three stresses " education and is the specific embodiment of the principle of running the party strictly in the " three stresses " education .  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
On solving the relationships between the central and local authorities , and between the Kremlin and various party factions , Putin has actively consulted with all leaders , striven to reach consensus , and successively promulgated relevant policies , so that Russia 's political situation would not sink into a chaotic situation before the election .  One after another , leaders of various parties and local leaders expressed their support for Putin 's presidential race .  
Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Recently , the state has promulgated the " Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Granting Preferential Treatment to Foreign-Invested Enterprises Set Up in the Central and Western Regions by Reducing Enterprise Income Tax Rate to 15 Percent in Three Years , " by which the foreign-invested enterprises encouraged by the state to set up in the central and western regions may reduce their enterprise income tax to 15 percent within three years after the current term of the tax preferential policy expires .  This will energetically boost foreign investment in the central and western regions .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
To push forward the large-scale development of the western region , all localities are required to act in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities , carry out their work in a down-to-earth manner , further broaden their vision , and base their work on a higher starting point , stressed Wu Bangguo .  
The meeting held : Since a similar national televised and teleconference was held last year , most central and local media units have striven to separate news-reporting activities from commercial activities , and to separate news-covering and editing personnel from commercial departments , and attained remarkable results in this regard .  
In 1999 , various localities had , in line with the CPC Central Committee 's unified arrangements , conscientiously implemented the principle of " singing aloud the major theme song and of seizing well initiative , served the overall situation by concentrating efforts on the central task of economic construction , done a massive amount of meticulous work , and scored marked success .  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
The central leadership made the major policy decision on the great development of China 's west .  The national economy is undergoing strategic restructuring .  The state set forth a series of policies for expanding domestic demand and promoting economic growth .  
The central government has put an end to its past practice of uniform and direct central management and control by allowing various localities and departments to adopt flexible or varied production or operation modes ; has called for developing a superior economy by suiting measures to the local conditions or opportunities ; has urged all sectors to carry out economic accounting and ensure economic efficiency ;  
In view of such a situation , the party committees at all levels in enterprises administered by central authorities should approach the matter from the high plane of stressing on politics , gain a thoroughgoing understanding on the extreme importance of the principle of " paying attention to two types of work , attaching equal importance to both , " adopt earnest and effective measures , strengthen leadership , and enhance the building of a sound party style and a clean administration in state enterprises to a new level .  
Chen Xiwen has long been involved in agricultural economic theory and policy research .  He worked on drafting documents for the central government regarding problems of farming villages .  He wrote more than 10 books about this subject .  He also published more than 150 dissertations and research reports .  He is an expert in this field .

"  Under the situation in which there were a-hundred things to do , the central finance allocated 4-million yuan of special funds in three years running to the border areas for their development and defined specific plans urging the inland developed provinces and cities to support the border minority nationalities areas .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .

The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have exerted ourselves to carry out a series of policies to enrich the people formulated by the central authorities , unceasingly satisfied the people 's ever growing material and cultural demands , and brought about improvement in the economic and social level and the people 's living standards .  
In accordance with the arrangements of the central and provincial authorities , we have conscientiously organized the " three-stress " education and , combining it with the activities of setting up " united , clean , and good leading groups with a pioneering spirit " launched in the entire city , lost no time in resolving the problems unsuited to the new situation and new tasks facing the party building and the SEZ development .  
We will certainly live up to the earnest expectations of the party 's central committee .  In accordance with the requirements of the " Three Represents , " we will strengthen the party building in a comprehensive way , lead the people of the entire city to summon up all their courage and energy , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and work hard to build Shenzhen into a socialist demonstration city bearing Chinese characteristics and taking the lead in basically realizing modernization .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
For the principal leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level to concentrate a period of time for specific discussions on some major issues of reform and development is an effective move adopted by the central authorities in order to enhance the ability of high-ranking cadres to implement the party 's line and principles and to manage the economy and society in the new situation .  
At the same time , starting with the first five-year plan , the central authorities concentrated finances to invest in a number of key construction projects ; within quite a short time we built up an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system on the backward " poor and blank " foundation left over from old China .

Zhu Rongji stated that the State Council is going to organize a special force and , once an in-depth investigative study is completed , propose a plan for improving the social security system at the end of the year .  Once it is approved by the central authorities , it may be implemented on a trial basis in Liaoning first , while the other provinces and regions may select one or two local places and cities to implement pilot projects , promoting it comprehensively once we have obtained some experience .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
After establishing " energy and transportation as key strategic points , " the late ' 80s and early ' 90s saw the inception of huge projects such as the Three Gorges Dam , the comprehensive hydro-power development of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He River , accelerating development of western oil and central coal fields , and the extension of the Yanlonghai railway line as the " second continental bridge , " among other large-scale projects that concentrated funding in the west .  
The requirements set by the third-generation core of party leadership have been conscientiously carried out , and constant attention has been paid to educating the army in advanced ideology , ethics , science , and culture and encouraging and inspiring officers and men with fine intellectual products ; as a result , they have in different periods of time created a number of fine literary and artistic works embodying the spirit and giving full scope to the central theme of the times .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Building up a high-quality , unified , and standardized central database for examination questions at the national level in line with high standards is a major way for enhancing the scientific level of examinations , and is also an effective measure for enhancing the work efficiency .  Examinations designed to serve the purpose of an open selection and promotion of leading cadres are different from those designed for national education , and also different from those designed for the employment of state functionaries .  
Studying and understanding the important thinking of the Three Represents should be the key content in such study programs as Party committees central groups , theoretical learning programs for cadres ranked above regiment level and the education through Party 's lectures .  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
The central leading comrades concerned personally convened a conference , laid out arrangements for investigating and handling the matter , and required that it be treated as an especially important case in centralized activities to " eliminate pornography and fight illegal publications " .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
Strengthening the Party 's and the military 's aims should be taken as the basic requirement for such study programs as Party committees ' central groups , the Party 's life , theoretical learning programs for cadres and ideological education periodically held in the military .  We should devote unswerving , profound and permanent efforts , brand it and root it through periodic and repeated and effectively find answers from the bottom of their heart for the questions of " Why did we join the Party ?  What do we work for ?

For more than 20 years now , the basic lines , basic guiding principles , and policies for reform and opening up formulated and continually improved by the Party 's second and third generations of central leadership work hard to embody the forward direction of developmental requirements for China 's advanced productive force and culture , truly representing the basic interests of the majority .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
They should transform concern from the Party , the central government and the Central Military Commission into the powerful impetus of self-strengthening and self-sufficiency , struggling to press their way forward with a pioneering spirit and with courageous contributions .  They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .

The key now is to continue the effort to implement them properly in accordance with the central authorities ' plan .  It is necessary to harmonize speed with efficiency , scale with structure , and quantity with quality , putting quality improvement and efficiency enhancement first ;  
In recent years , the whole party carried out the activities of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , conducted " three stress " education among cadres at and above the county level , recently studied and propagated Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thesis on " three represents " , and held a central ideological and political work conference not long ago .  All this has given full play to our party 's strong political advantages and effectively guaranteed the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field .  
He said : The party 's ideological and political work is the lifeblood of economic and all other work , is the central link for uniting the whole party and the entire people of all ethnical groups throughout the country to fulfill all tasks of the party and the state , and is the major political superiority of our party and socialist state .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .

Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
We must study his noble character of being loyal to the party and the people , study his lofty spirit of seeking truth from facts and upholding the truth , and study his solid and strict style of work .  Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on foreign affairs , unflinchingly carry out the foreign policy of independence and peace , and further open up a new prospect for China 's diplomatic work .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
In October 1978 , the central government convened the third national people 's defense work conference , determined the people 's air defense principle of " making overall planning , giving play to major points , integrating peacetime and wartime efforts , and putting quality first , " thus entering a stage in the people 's air defense work that stressed comprehensive and coordinated development , quality , and combining peacetime and wartime efforts .  
When we are exultant at the great achievements made in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and review the extraordinary course traversed by the people in the whole country under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we deeply feel that the party central leading body indeed has the superb ability to bring the overall situation under control and apply regulatory mechanisms to scientifically handle complicated situations while exercising leadership , and this was the fundamental guarantee for the great achievements in the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan .  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
In dealing with both inflation and deflation , the party central leadership and the State Council consistently gave play to the role of the market as the foundation for distributing resources , comprehensively employed various economic levers , employed necessary legal and administrative means as supplements , and accumulated rich experience in conducting macroeconomic readjustment and control .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
The party and government 's handling of this historically rare incident again showed that the party central with Jiang Zemin at the core possesses the extraordinary ability to drive internal politics and foreign relations and sharp leadership skills for handling all kinds of complex situations .

Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .

The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .

6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
When moving into the new century , we have all reasons to believe that under the guidance of the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and under the strong leadership of the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , we will certainly be able to surmount all challenges and risks from either domestic or foreign factors , and the banner of socialism will flutter high on the vast land of China for ever .  
Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult constantly spread rumors to confuse the people and make trouble in violation of the law .

Power struggle between local officials , plenipotentiaries directly commissioned by the President to federate regions , and central administrative institutions may arise from time to time .  In particular , the establishment of peace in Chechenya and the shaping of its future will remain a longstanding headache for Russia .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
In compliance with the trend in history and by giving account to Hong Kong 's situation and interests , the central authorities set forth the important principles of " one country , two systems , " " Hong Kong being governed by local people , " and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong .

It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .

and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
The source said that " a sense of crisis " was especially stressed at the Central Work Conference held earlier this year .  Analysis by the central authorities shows that the current domestic and international situation is intense .  
Upholding the four cardinal principles and persisting in reform and opening up are closely integrated and mutually stimulating , and they can not be separated or set against each other ; we must unify into the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics the combination of regarding economic construction as the central task with the four cardinal principles and with reform and opening up .  
At the meeting , attendees diligently studied the important speeches of Jiang Zemin , Zhu Rongji , and other central leading comrades concerning the work related to public order , as well as the spirits of the national public order work conference and the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order ; and mapped out arrangements for launching a nationwide struggle to strike hard and put things in order .  
In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .  The measures included the banning of party and government institutions , military units , armed police force , judicial and law enforcement organs from running enterprises ;  
According to the spirit of the central economic work conference and the Fourth Session of the Ninth National People 's Congress , the meeting analyzed the current situation , unified people 's thinking , and set forth the main tasks and key points for this year 's work .  
All localities and all departments must keep a strong sense of political responsibility and the spirit of being highly responsible to the interests of the people , carefully organize their actions according to the unified arrangements of the central leadership , take effective measures and achieve solid results in restoring a regular and orderly condition of the market so that the people can be satisfied and can set their minds at rest .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
In a short space of several years , Taiwan 's depth of defense has been drastically reduced .  Each time the military aircraft of our navy and air force , dispatched to defend our air space and territorial sea , confront communist China 's military aircraft flying close to the central line , they begin to worry whether the other party will suddenly cross the line or take more hostile action .  
We must fully understand the importance and urgency of doing a good job of public security work , earnestly implement the " strike hard " principle and various measures for comprehensive management of social security , which were formulated by the central authorities , and create a sound social environment for the state 's long-term political stability and economic development .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
The decree urges all officers and men throughout the military to rally still more closely around the party central committee , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , consciously study and practice the requirements of the " three represents , " work in a down-to-earth manner , wage unremitting struggles , step up preparations for military struggles , and constantly raise our military 's defense and combat capabilities under modern conditions , thereby making even greater contributions toward realizing reunification of the motherland and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
Soon afterward , the army crossed the Chang Jiang to the south .  After a half year of arduous long-distance marching and fighting , it arrived in central Hunan where it fulfilled its mission of establishing an anti-Japanese base area centered around Heng Shan .  
In August of that same year , after Japan surrendered , the army , upon receiving orders from the central leadership , continued south , arriving in northern Guangdong where it prepared for a rendezvous with the Dongjiang Column . However , with its advance blocked by the Kuomingtang troops , it went north to rendezvous again with the 5th Division of the New 4th Army .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
However , facts have shown Hong Kong 's Falungong has a political purpose when its members exercise , it has reduced itself to the status of a political organization following Li Hongzhi 's order and targeting at the central government , and it has continued to engage in activities incompatible with the stated purpose when it registered itself as a social group .  
It is only right and natural that such an action is unacceptable to them .  As to Falungong 's plan to have Falungong elements from overseas gather in Hong Kong to repeat what they did during a previous international gathering , it is another sinister attempt to transform Hong Kong into an anti-Chinese base targeting at the central government .  
The procedure also stipulates that no Internet online service business sites are to be set up within 200 meters of such places as key central party , political , and military organs , within 200 meters of middle and elementary schools , and in residential buildings .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
Unify the standards for textbook writing .  Rural primary and secondary schools should adopt economical and suitable editions .  Governments of provinces ( autonomous regions , municipalities directly administered by the central government ) should procure and distribute textbooks using the bidding method and have textbooks delivered to students on time at the least costs while ensuring quality .  
The comrades in charge of pertinent departments and units under the party 's central committee and State Council and the Beijing-based comrades in charge of the backbone enterprises managed by the central authorities attended the meeting at the main conference hall .  The leading comrades from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and those from various prefectural ( city ) and county people 's governments and relevant departments attended the meeting at sub-meeting-rooms .  
Efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the central authorities pursuing the large-scale western development strategy , put reconstruction work onto the local governments ' 10th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development and their programs for poverty eradication through development , promote development through the reconstruction efforts , and unceasingly facilitate common prosperity among all ethnic groups .  
On behalf of the party central committee and the State Council and also in his personal name , he extended warm congratulations to the entire staff of teachers , students , and other staff of Qinghua University , and extended cordial greetings to teachers , students , and staffs of all institutions of higher education and comrades engaged in educational work throughout the country .  
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
He said : Implementing the strategy to speed up development in China 's central and west regions is a major government policy drawn out according to the country 's overall situation and geared to the new century .  It is of great significance for China to gradually narrow the gap among various regions , promote a coordinated growth , and push forward the common prosperity of all nationalities in the country .  It is also an important policy for materializing the third-step objectives of China 's modernization drive .  
Comrades in charge of pertinent departments under central and state organs , comrades assigned to take charge of the work from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and persons in charge of the people 's governments at prefectural , city , and county levels participated in the conference .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
Now facing the 21st century , we must adhere to the theme of development , focus on economic construction as the central task unswervingly , work hard to realize the " four modernizations , " and accomplish the historical mission of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation .  To achieve this grand goal , we must make energetic efforts to improve the basic quality of the whole people .  
Wu Yi pointed out : Cities are situated in a central position in economic and social development , and play a strong influential and leading role in their peripheral areas .  It is necessary to do creative work in accordance with the actual conditions , give full play to their advantages in science , technology , education , and human resources , and more quickly advance the implementation of the strategy of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Since the start of reform and opening up , especially since the third central conference on work in Tibet , various undertakings have surged forward full of vigor , the outlook of urban and rural areas has changed greatly , and people 's living standards have been raised .  All those are unprecedented in the history of Tibet .  
The propaganda and ideological front must center closely on the theme of celebrations defined by the central authorities ; firmly grasp the correction orientation ; loudly chorus the main theme of the Communist Party , socialism , and the drive of reform and opening up being good ; vigorously create a rich and dense atmosphere of loving the party , loving the motherland , and loving socialism ;  
and inspire all Communists and the people in their hundreds and millions , to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory ; rally more closely around the central Party Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; adhere to the party 's basic line and program ; heighten fighting spirit ; forge ahead while constantly opening up new prospects in work ; and unremittingly struggle for the realization of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization in the new century .  
Meanwhile , we must also notice that the burden is heavy and the road is long in cracking down on Mafia-style gang crimes .  What the ordinary people fear most is that we might carry out the struggle for the short term , passing like a gust of wind , and then give it up halfway .  Therefore , all localities and departments must unify their thinking and understanding on the central spirit , buttress confidence , strive still harder and press ahead , and unceasingly carry out the strike-hard struggle in depth .  
It has been more than a month since the national work conference on rectifying and standardizing market economic order was held .  During that period , all localities and all departments have been conscientiously living up to the spirit of the central work conference in light of local conditions and taken effective and concrete measures to launch market economic order rectification work , with emphasis on investigating a number of major and large cases , with some initial success .  
Since the 1980 ' s , the central government has practiced a series of preferential policies toward Tibet , which include the agricultural tax exemption for the agricultural and pastoral areas in recuperation and the abolition of planned purchases and quota purchases of agricultural , animal , special , and local products by the state ;  
Such achievements have made an important contribution to the successful implementation of " the 9th five-year " plan in our region and the basic realization of developmental goals established at the third Tibet Work Forum set forth by the central authorities .  They have also created favorable conditions for carrying out the strategic goal of a leap forward in economic and social development in our region during the new period .  
we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;  
The signing of the " 17-Point Agreement " and the peaceful liberation of Tibet were a wise policy decision and a great pioneering undertaking made by the first generation of leaders of the central authorities , with Chairman Mao Zedong as the core , through applying the basic theories of Marxism about ethnic issues , and in light of the history and the existing actual conditions of Tibet , as well as a successful example of the Communist Party of China correctly handling ethnic issues according to the principles of equality and unity .  
All of the 62 engineering projects which were built with aid from the whole country to Tibet have already been delivered for use , the situation of infrastructures in Tibet like transportation , energy resources , and communications lagging seriously behind has been greatly improved , its priority industries have been developed , and the living standards of the people have been further increased .  These are vivid embodiments of the central authorities applying the ideology of development to direct the work in Tibet .  
Except for a small number of social security objects , an exceptionally poor population living in areas with harsh natural conditions , as well as a certain number of the disabled , we have now basically resolved the problem of insufficient food and clothing for the poverty-stricken population in rural areas across the country , and have basically fulfilled all anti-poverty targets set by the central authorities .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
Some current provincial governors and ministers ( excluding those in special departments ) between the ages of 62 and 65 years ( the age for retirement at this level ) will be retired ahead of time by the end of this year so that their younger successors may be elected into the party central committee next year at the 16th party congress .  
At present , some incumbent provincial governors and ministers are close to the retirement age of 65 years , and may be asked to retire before the end of their current tenure .  The relevant central department decided that it should be arranged for younger cadres to take over their leading positions so that the successors may smoothly enter the new central committee at the 16th party congress to be held in October 2002 .  
Reportedly , the main reason for arranging the retirement of ministers and provincial governors ahead of time was that these officials will reach or exceed the retirement age of 65 years by the time the CPC holds its 16th national congress next year , and they will no longer be able to remain in leading positions at that time .  If these people still remain in the current leading positions , they will be included in the name list of the new central committee membership , and this may prevent their successors from entering the central committee .  
It is learned that the personnel appointments for the ministers of all departments in the States Council and the governors of all provinces have been made .  Although the primary leaders of the State Council ministries and commission should be changed in 2003 according to the usual practice , this time , to quicken the process of fostering and promoting younger cadres , the central leadership decided to make the changes ahead of time .  Thus , the leadership changes at the ministerial and provincial governor level will be completed prior to the 16th party national congress .  
3 .  The mainland failed to coordinate .  Due to the differences of views between its central and local authorities and between its different local authorities , it lacked unified policies for approving and issuing entry certificates to the people of our side .  It also deferred in eliminating the obstacles of laws to its commodity imports and exports and imposed strict restrictions on its people 's visits to Kinmen and Matsu , thus limiting the implementation of the three mini links .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
During the last 50 years , thanks to the concern of the central authorities and the support of the people in the rest of the country , the party , the government , the military , the police , and the people were united as one and worked hard and perseveringly to accomplish the tremendous achievement of rapid economic development , all-round social progress , and continuous improvement in the people 's living standards .  The entire region has gone through earth-shaking changes .  
We must always uphold the guidelines for work in Tibet during the new period formulated at the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , which call for " taking economic construction as the central task ; firmly focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation ; and ensuring Tibet 's accelerated economic development , all-round social progress , lasting peace and stability , and continuous improvement of the people 's living standards . "  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .  
We must never be unworthy of the concern and expectation of the central authorities and the whole nation .  We must overcome all difficulties , work vigorously to make the region prosperous , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , and produce brilliant results once more in the course of developing Tibet by leaps and bounds and ensuring lasting peace and stability .  
Participating in the national conference were responsible officials of relevant central departments ; responsible official of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the central government , and sub-provincial-level cities ; and responsible officials of the armed forces , the armed police force , and major military units .  
Luo Gan , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee , state councilor , and secretary of the Central Commission of Political Science and Law , attended the closing session of the work conference , and gave a speech .  On behalf of the party central leadership and the State Council , he extended warm congratulations to the advanced collectives and individuals being commended , and also extended cordial greetings to the comrades working in the front of legal system propaganda and education throughout the country .  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
In order to bring about peaceful reunification , Mr . Deng Xiaoping on 26 June 1983 elaborated on a six-point proposal : Holding " talks on an equal footing to achieve a third round of cooperation , rather than talks between the central and local governments " , " after reunification , the Taiwan special administration region may practice a social system different from that of the mainland ;  
Recently , " Nanfang Zhoumo " , a weekend magazine in Guangzhou , was " purged " on a large scale because its reportage deviated from the standards laid down by the central authorities .  The contingent of editors and reporters was changed substantively .  The leading body of the editorial office was changed ; several editors and reporters were dismissed or disciplined ; other editors and reporters had to be reexamined and reassessed .  
It is necessary to check the implementation of the spirit of the central directives and National Social Order Work Conference , examine whether the localities have dealt with the critical points in line with local reality , and review the effects of the " strike hard " struggle .  They should also inspect the cases jointly handled by the central political and law departments and localities , the crackdown on triads , the removal of the " protective umbrella " granted to the triad forces , as well as the difficulties and obstacles encountered in attacking triads .  
Recently , the Chinese Communists ' high-level departments concerned , including the Central Political Science and Law Group , have proclaimed that the campaign to suppress Falungong has achieved fruitful results at this stage , adding that this is entirely attributable to the central authorities ' decision plus the " decisive and resolute " action taken by the public security sector .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
They should associate strategies and policies issued by the central government with realities in their own region and department , combine needs with possibilities , unite the spirit of forging ahead with that of seeking the truth and being realistic .  They should align working enthusiasm with being scientific .  All comrades in the Party , particularly leading cadres , should work in a creative manner and use innovations in their leadership styles and skills to look toward a new horizon in building the Party and socialist modernization construction .  
To properly organize various commemorative activities , we should follow the guidance of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , closely surround the main theme determined by the party central leadership , and sing aloud the eulogy for praising the Communist Party , socialism , and reform and opening up with full enthusiasm and strong assurance , thus encouraging the entire party membership and the people to continue to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and march forward to create a bright future for the cause of socialist modernization .  
He said that party committees and governments at all levels in Sichuan have seriously implemented a series of central principles and policies to strengthen the protection and improvement of the ecological environment , taken the lead in launching the project to protect natural forests and making experiments on returning farmland to forests , taken prompt actions with a resolute attitude , done solid work and adopted effective measures .  They have enabled the people to consciously implement the party 's policies , accumulated much successful experience , and attained remarkable achievements .  
In May last year , the center received a tip-off reflecting that principal leaders of the party committee of Qingyang Prefecture , Gansu Province , recklessly promoted cadres without regard to the regulations on bringing promotion of cadres under strict control before organizational realignment , set forth by the central authorities and the provincial party committee .  After that , the center entrusted the Organizational Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee to investigate into and handle this case .  
The central leadership recently decided to adopt a management system " with responsibility being borne by local governments , mainly at the county level , and management being conducted from top to bottom at each administrative level under the unified leadership of the State Council " .  Under this system , the responsibilities for each level from central , to provincial , and then prefecture ( city ) and county are all explicitly defined .  In particular , counties must bear the main responsibility for local rural compulsory education .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
In order to strengthen guidance for building rural grass-roots party organizations , the central authorities and relevant departments promulgated in succession the " CPC regulations governing the work of rural grass-roots organizations " , the " opinions of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of ranks of rural grass-roots cadres " , the " circular on universally implementing in the rural areas the systems of making village affairs public and managing village affairs in a democratic way " , and other important documents .  
" Falungong " is a cult .  This is not determined by the " will of the chief executive " , nor is it the central government 's subjective " decision " .  It is an iron-clad fact based on innumerable instances , and the conclusion is based on foreign governments ' legislation experiences .  
The third generation of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has shown great foresight , managed the overall situation , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , continued to deepen reform and expanded opening up , vigorously advanced the building of the socialist market economy system , surmounted difficulties , overcome all kinds of risks from political and economic fields as well as from nature , and succeeded in realizing a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and safeguarding social and political stability .  
Practice proved that the third general of central leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the unusual political wisdom and superior skills of controlling the complicated situation , and is a strong leadership collective that leads the whole party and the people throughout the country to comprehensively push the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  
The first leap took place during the new democratic revolutionary period .  The first generation of central leadership collective with Mao Zedong at the core led the whole party and the people throughout the country to find China 's own revolutionary road through repeated explorations and on the basis of summing up successful and unsuccessful experiences , and established Mao Zedong Thought .  
We firmly believe , that under the leadership of the spirit of this fourth seminar held by the central committee on the work in Tibet , and through the united struggle of all levels of the region , both high and low , especially the united struggle of the broad mass of farmers and herders and of grass-roots cadres , we will certainly be able to accomplish the goals and tasks of the work of assisting the impoverished and of development during this new stage . 
To carry out economic construction as the central task is the basic means and fundamental way out for us to break free of poverty and backwardness , attain all-round social progress in Tibet , constantly satisfy the people 's needs materially and culturally , ensure a constant improvement in the people 's living standard and join the rest of the country in achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
Reviewing and summarizing the glorious 80-year history of our party , we have come to a more profound understanding that always integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the concrete practice of China 's revolution and construction , always firmly relying on the millions of people to acquire endless motive force for progress , and always comprehensively strengthening and improving party building in line with the party 's central task constitute the basic experience for our party to conquer hardships , maintain vigor , and make progress continuously .  
In our party 's magnificent course of development over the past 80 years , the three generations of its central collective leadership with Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core , respectively , have set up and developed the broadest united front , and it has won over the hearts of people and strengthened their cohesion to the maximum ; thus , the united front has made historic contributions to China 's revolution , construction , and reform , adding a glorious chapter to Chinese history .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
First , on behalf of the party central leadership , he extended warm congratulations to the commended advanced collectives and outstanding individuals , and expressed cordial greetings to all Communist Party members and the vast mass of cadres and workers in the central departments .  
Party organizations at all levels and the vast party rank and file and party cadres in the central departments must take the lead in studying and implementing Comrade Jiang Zemin 's recent important instructions on strengthening and improving the party 's style building , make great effort to carry forward the good tradition and style developed by the party over a long period of practice , effectively and properly solve the prominent problems existing in the field of style , and take concrete actions to build a good image for the leading organs among the people .  
He said : The meeting conscientiously studied the important instructions of Jiang Zemin and other central leading comrades on doing a good job in finding out and reflecting social conditions and public opinions , summed up and exchanged the experience in doing this work well , and set forth opinions and proposals on further strengthening and deepening this work .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
He first extended warm congratulations to the commended advanced workers and collectives on behalf of the party central leading body , expressed lofty respects for all experts and scholars in the study of party history , and expressed cordial greetings to the vast number of party history researchers and workers throughout the country .  
When talking about the central government 's 2000 final accounting report approved by the Standing Committee , Li Peng said : It is necessary to more effectively implement the law on budgets and the decision on intensifying the central government 's budget auditing supervision and other relevant laws , guarantee that the budget of the current fiscal year approved by the NPC session will be implemented properly , prevent the appearance of law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena in the course of implementing the budget .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practicable steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
The incident greatly shocked the central hierarchy .  A top leader was said to be so angry that he pounded at the table as he rebuked the two public security and court officials for being decadent in the extreme .  He said that they deserved at least a-thousand deaths for selling their country for a mere sum of money .  
They are all determined to , under the leadership of the party central body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , deeply implement the principles and policies of the central leadership for the Taiwan issue , keep a strong sense of political responsibility , work hard to break new ground and make solid progress , unite compatriots on both sides of the straits and overseas compatriots to fight against all separatist attempts , and make contributions to the accomplishment of the motherland 's reunification at an earlier date .  
All localities should make arrangements around the key fields pointed out by the central leadership in connection with their local conditions , fully mobilize the masses , concentrate the police force , crack accumulated cases , smash criminal gangs , seize criminals at large .  In particular , more severe and rapid actions should be taken to crack criminal cases , especially serious and malicious cases occurring in the period of the " strike hard " period .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
Luo Gan said : Comrade Dong Biwu was a proletarian revolutionary revered and cherished by the entire party and all people throughout the country .

Fee collection standards which exceed those formulated by the State Council , the government of a province , autonomous region , or municipality directly subordinate to the central government , or national and provincial level planning , pricing , and finance organizations , is classified as illegal or unauthorized collection of fees to the extent of the excess portion .

If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
According to state regulations , county-level financial departments should pay wages directly to teachers on regular payrolls .  As to the counties without sufficient financial resources and with actual difficulties in paying wages to teachers , problems in this area should be resolved through readjustment of the expenditure structure and in the way to increase transfer payments between central and local revenues .  
The celebrations have fully reflected the tremendous progress achieved by Tibet over the past 50 years , given wide publicity to the principles and policies of the central authorities toward Tibet , considerably aroused the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups in building up a new socialist Tibet , and will surely bring about a vigorous development to all undertakings in Tibet in the new century .

Since the beginning of this year , our economy has continued to maintain a positive momentum of development .  This is a result of the fact that the central authorities keenly sensed the new changes in the world economy and , in good time , adopted a correct macroeconomic policy accordingly , and the whole nation worked as one in a down-to-earth manner .  It is also connected to the energetic endeavor to rectify and regulate the market economic order .  
The study activities have thus entered a new stage of assiduous study , conscientious pondering , organization of research on special topics , and firm implementation .  On 29 July , the central group for theoretical study of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee once again organized a study course to exchange what had been gained in the study , and all participants freely aired what they had learned from the study .  The atmosphere was lively throughout the study course .  
The meeting held that the present publicity reportage is powerful and dynamic and in line with the central spirit ; it has a clear keynote and plays a correct guiding role ; and it has publicized the main points of the " 1 July " speech and created a good atmosphere of public opinion .  
Practice has fully proved that the party 's third-generation central leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core is the loyal and reliable successor to China 's socialist cause initiated by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and an energetic and promising pioneer .  
The theoretical study central group of the party group of the organs of the National Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative studied once again Jiang Zemin 's " 1 July " important speech in a concentrated and thoroughgoing way in close connection with the realities in the CPPCC organs and implemented the spirit of the speech in real earnest .  
To profoundly study and implement the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , the meeting decided to adopt several measures on the basis of study : first , the central group of the Central Discipline-Inspection Commission would set aside a period of time for carefully studying and discussing specific topics in Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , so as to achieve a profound understanding and accurate grasp of the spiritual essence .  
At the exhibition , more than 2,000 valuable pictures and 500 cultural relics , displayed in chronological sequence of historical development , vividly depicted the brilliant achievements scored by the people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying out revolution , reform , construction , and reform under the leadership of the party 's three generations of central collective leadership with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Raidi said : Successive Dalai Lamas first searched for a few candidates for a relevant reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals , before selecting one of them according to the ceremony of drawing lots from a golden urn and confirming the child after the approval of the central government .  Any act that runs counter to historical conventions and religious rituals would be regarded as invalid .  
the strong central leadership which is experienced and can have various complicated situations well in hand ; the correct line focusing on economic construction ; and the successful experience of handling well the relationship between reform on the one hand and development and stability on the other and of maintaining social stability , we are fully confident that our state will make further progress and our nation will prosper .  
According to sources , the central bank is really devoted to such vigorous investigation into and coping with the illegal operation of credit funds in the stock market , and it ordered such funds to be withdrawn within three months - - that is before end of September . The reason is that the high-ranking decision-makers in the central committee agreed upon and attached great importance to the matter .  
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
Xinjiang is located on the northwest edge of China , and it adjoins with eight nations on its periphery .  Xinjiang possesses abundant water , land , solar , and thermal resources , and abundant mineral resources ; it has already become the central location for the central committee 's implementation of its strategy of grand opening to the West .  
At 24:00 , we , through an internal channel , reported to the central leading authorities that , " according to preliminary investigations , 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident . "  
Members of the leading groups of the governments of various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central government for rectifying and standardizing the market economic order ; the major responsible persons of the various city and country governments ; and the responsible persons of relevant departments attended today 's conference at various branch venues .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
As far as the whole country is concerned , the primary task at present is to unswervingly implement the central authorities ' current social security policies and measures , do a really good job in the " two assurances " work , and ensure that the basic living needs of laid-off workers from state enterprises and the basic pensions of retired workers are paid on time and in sufficient amount ; we absolutely can not have new debts arising in this respect .

High pressure should also be exerted on criminal offenders and lawbreakers .  The anti-crime campaign must achieve solid results and be carried out with great momentum , thus effectively deterring and frightening criminals and gratify the people , and guaranteeing that the objective of making marked improvements in the condition of law and order set forth by the central leadership will be smoothly achieved .  Second , great efforts should be made to improve routine public order maintenance and crime prevention .  
A source revealed : In accordance with the spirit of a central work meeting held in Beidaihe , the State Council has decided to introduce a series of new policies and measures aimed at stimulating domestic demand , including increasing personal consumption credit and loans , including those for purchasing residential units and cars , and speeding up input in infrastructure projects , and to urge the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] to approve on an earlier date , the issuance of 50-billion yuan of national bonds as well .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
Because of two decades ' rapid and steady economic growth , China 's combined national strength has grown remarkably , enabling it to increase its support for central and western parts of China .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
Relevant central officials held that the state should first establish guiding organs , formulate laws and regulations , and monitor and investigate illegal and harmful news reports .  The Internet institutions or service providers of non-information units will not be allowed to write or release their own news reports , nor is any website allowed to transmit media reports from abroad as well as from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan . Domestic websites are required to obtain approval before being registered abroad .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
The State Economic and Trade Commission has proposed to set up technological development centers in over 500 key enterprises , and more than two-thirds of the large and medium enterprises will strive to set up similar organizations within two to three years .  In the meantime , the technological innovative supporting systems geared to the needs of the medium and small enterprises will be set up in 30 central cities .  
The policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .  Army , armed police , procuratorial , judicial and public security organizations thoroughly broke off relations with their subsidiary enterprises while the work of breaking off relations between the central state organs and their subsidiary enterprises was basically implemented and progress was also made in the work of breaking off relations between the local Party and administrative organs and their subsidiary enterprises .  
He said : Since foreign capital shall be barred from news channels and the issue of jointly producing programs with foreign investors for certain professional channels has been placed on the agenda for discussion , all shall be temporarily suspended pending the introduction of policies and the local departments concerned shall be banned from holding discussions with foreign investors or conjecturing the central policies . 
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
- - He stressed holding cross-strait talks on an equal basis under the one-China principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "  He reiterated that conditions for Taiwan can be more liberal than those for Hong Kong and Macao , that is , a high degree of autonomy ; the mainland will not send troops and officials to Taiwan ; Taiwan 's judicial powers will be completely independent ; Taiwan will have the power of final adjudication ; Taiwan can completely retain its original party , administrative , and military systems ;  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
Addressing a group discussion held by the Inner Mongolia delegation on the afternoon of 5 March , Buhe , vice chairman of the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee , said : Premier Zhu Rongji 's government work report stressed the strategy of actively developing west China and the issues of expeditiously developing central and west China . This is an important and very popular policy decision .  It has a strategic significance whereby if we can properly accomplish this task , other regions will also be invigorated .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
The numerous opinions put forward in June 1999 , when the NPC Standing Committee deliberated over the final central financial account and the central financial audit report for 1998 , were the reasons why the reform was started officially .  However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
Ministry budgetary planning implies that China 's budgetary planning is gradually going on to the scientific , systemized , and standardized track , and the openness , fair , just , and other special qualities that the budgetary planning should posses , as well as the transparency in central budget , will also be improved and increased further .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .  Judging from the whole , however , the results achieved in this aspect are out of proportion to the rapid spread and multiplication of corrupt practices in the country .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
A source disclosed that the mainland 's Taiwan Work Department and experts engaged in Taiwan research work have carried out intensive consultations over the past week .  After smoothing out internal differences , a common understanding was reached at the meeting of the chairmen of the Taiwan Affairs Office that closed last week ; that is , the principle of taking economic construction as the central task will not be forsaken .  Efforts made to develop the domestic economy and increase overall national strength will be the powerful foundation for eventually settling the Taiwan issue .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
In his speech , Zhang Bolin said : The changes in the principal leaders of the State Sports General Bureau were decided by the party central leadership for the purpose of promoting cadre exchanges to meet the actual needs in enhancing the leading body .  The decision was based on giving consideration to the general situation and was a normal change in the organizational work .  
The central leadership holds that the appointments of new principal leaders to the State Sports General Bureau are proper , and the new leaders can support each other with their own strong points .  Zhang Bolin also put forward some requirements for the future work of the State Sports General Bureau : Enhance the sense of political responsibility , continue to advance the reform and development of sports ; consolidate and expand the results of " three stress " education , do a good job in party building and contingent building ;  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .

Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
However , the east coast is shown as blank , and the central highlands are simply indicated by painted peaks , because the sheer mountains , and fierce tribes of those regions meant that Ching rule was ineffective beyond the coastal plain to the west .  
He set up elementary schools in the island 's five towns and Kinmen senior high school , its highest academic institution . Next he led the troops in laying the island 's two main outer roads and its central highway . He also built a tobacco plant and a liquor distillery and encouraged farmers to plant sorghum , which they could sell to the distillery at high prices . Bottling and packaging for the liquor industry stimulated business at the ceramic plant and printing plant .  
The Center held to this central concept throughout the process of finding and selecting a site , deciding on New York , laying out a budget , starting construction and finallyreparing the interior . " It was an incredibly complex , painstaking task that is actually of little interest to anyone who was n't directly involved , " as Director of the New York News and Culture Center Chang Min-chih puts it .  
" In fact the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and high foreign exchange reserves are not directly or necessarily linked with speculative fever or inflation . What is important is looking at how policy in the financial markets is carried out and supporting their stability , " says Lu Fang-ching , deputyexecutive secretary of the Commodity Price Supervisory Board at the Ministry of Economic Affairs examining the problem from another angle . " The point is that the central bank , compared to five years ago , is more experienced and very cautious . "  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
Last year the Amei River , located to the east of the Hsiu-kuluan River , and which originates in the Coastal Mountain Range , flooded over because of excessive silt buildup downstream . This year , the central , provincial , and county governments are preparing to spend NT $ 100 million to deal with this tiny , lessthan-10-kilometer-long stream .  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
Using a needle to implant silicone is fast and cheap and is a classic example of a technique that neither requires surgery nor leaves scars . It was an immediate hit . There are records of women from central and southern Taiwan coming north on chartered tour buses for " head-to-foot " plastic surgery .  
People who have disabilities within the following categories : impaired vision ; impaired hearing or balance ; speech or linguistic impediments ; bodily disabilities ; learning disabilities ; multiple disabilities ; malfunction of important internal organs ; facial deformities and wounds ; coma or senile dementia ; autism ; others ( as defined by the central authorities ) .  
Because the fashionable nineteenth-century top per required the use of mercury for stiffening its felt so it would stand up straight , factory workers would come into frequent contact with the metal . They would often suffer from a damaged central nervous system , loss of speech control , impaired vision and the ability to move .  
However , ailments such as cadmium , lead and mercury induced damage to the central nervous system , sterility and deformities , impairment of the immune system , damage to the respiratory system , liver poisoning and irreversible chronic poisoning are all on the rise . In relation to the chemical substances that are increasingly coming to permeate our daily lives , people are gradually coming to realize the risks they face from heavy metals .  
In " An Open Letter to Our Compatriots on Taiwan , " delivered in 1979 before the National People 's Congress by standing central committee member Ye Jianying , the Communists declared that they would cease shelling Kinmen , Matsu and other offshore islands and would set up navigation and postal links as soon as possible to facilitate direct contacts between the two sides and carry out acade mic and cultural exchange .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Toxological studies have shown that heavy metal poisoning damages every system of the body . Inacute poisoning , ingested heavy metals cause clear damage to the digestive system , producing nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , colic or melanosis . Inhaled in the lungs , they can cause necrotic bronchitis , tuberculosis or pneumoatothorax . In chronic poisoning , the central nervous system and the hematopoietic system are especially sensitive .  
In fact , in one famous district in central Taiwan , a builder once advertised that a building would be equipped with cold storage for garbage , only to find that once the building was completed , the residents were unwilling to foot the extra electricity charge .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Eastern Taiwan 's inconvenient transportation is well-known , especially the railroad . Because the east is obstructed by the double barrier of the central mountain range and the coastal mountain range , beginning work on the railroad was extremely difficult . The earliest constructed stretch was a simple narrow gauge line from Hwalien to Taitung .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
In the absence of a legal foundation , inevitably the division of powers and responsibilities between various levels of government has been unclear , causing frequent disputes . During the state of emergency , these disputes were often resolved or regulated by resort to administrative decrees at the central level . The lower levels of government had no basis for making objections .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
Fortunately , after years of contention , the situation has slightly improved . Today it is no longer necessary to get approval from the central government for anyone below civil service level 8 . And with regard to the top officials who can make or break the administration of a city or county , the executive has more room to haggle if he or she does not approve of the individual selected by the provincial government . The more influential chiefs can even recommend candidates and ask the provincial government to formally appoint them .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
The cloud leopard 's den : Auvini 's work is multi-faceted , and it mainly involves publishing newspaper articles about his interviews and research , which focus on traditional customs , tribal history , myths , legends , taboos , etc . He has discovered rules that anthropologists overlooked governing how the Haocha people placed their dead in their own homes . For example , men who died from natural causes were buried in front of the central pillar , whereas women were placed beneath a platform by the window .  
In terms of election demands , as the climate grew more open opinions of every political color were aired , and later the same year the DPP 's central standing committee passed its " Draft Constitution for Taiwan , " and proposed " founding an independent country . " The KMT , seizing on Taiwan 's middle classes ' collective fear of disorder and desire for stability , defined its position as one of " renewal , stability and prosperity , " while lambasting the DPP as the party of " violence and revolution . "  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan . Here they extended their experience in pioneering harsh and demanding terrain , and their characteristic traits were passed down from generation to generation .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
With their characteristic outline gone and their bodies covered by a tarpaulin which leaves only half their heads exposed , although the sharks ' teeth are still sharp , their eyes are sunken and they are no longer frightening . There they will wait until night , when lorries arrive to take them for auction at Taipei 's central market , ending their landward journey .  
Though the palace stands tall in a central position in downtown Taipei with countless people and vehicles streaming along the wide roads on all sides , the heavy guard of military police all around it has long made it an unapproachable , sternly mysterious forbidden territory in the eyes of the public .  
The tall central tower on top of the Presidential Palace is also the object of much curiosity . Every day at dawn and at 5:50 each afternoon , the public can watch the flag raising and lowering ceremonies , in which two military policemen hoist or take down the national flag on top of the tower . But just what kind of world is hidden inside the tower ?  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
After being returned to China , Taiwan was kept apart and given a special status because the mainland had not returned to a state of normalcy . Administration was placed in the hands of a single " hsing-cheng chang-kuan " appointed by the central government . This term is generally rendered into English as " governor , " but its literal translation is " chief executive official . " Meanwhile , other aspects of life in Taiwan - - such as the currency , rationing , and so on - - were also different from the mainland .  
On March 26 , 1988 , more than 200 brook masu salmon fry , each of them tagged for identification , prepared to leave the propagation center built for them by human beings and set out to return " home " - - to the Chichiawan Stream at Lishan in central Taiwan .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
In the center of the long hanging scroll stand a mountain and trees . They have an imposing grandeur , yet are upright and balanced about a vertical central axis , unmoved by any wind . So although there are mountain pines on myriad peaks , where is the soughing wind ?  
Leaving behind the central plains , they entered Sichuan on paths which were narrow and winding , difficult and dangerous . When , far from home , they heard the cuckoo sing , the legend of the Emperor of Shu turning into a cuckoo drifted into their memories . The rigors of a journey in Sichuan were enough to make the normally robust Li Bai write , " Again the cuckoo sings to the night moon , bringing melancholy to the empty mountains , " and lament that " The roads of Shu are difficult . "  
The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
In the end , Lin has selected and weighed the most absolutely central , canonical materials from history , taking into consideration every kind of musical genre and aspect of living concern , as in the typical emotions in human social life , praise of nature , the careful observation of transformations in space and time , various interesting features of everyday living , the fundamental pulse of life , and so forth , and in this way has gradually expanded the collection to 67 musical pieces .  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
Another example is a set of pictures taken on 22 April 1979 , when President Chiang went with the then Taiwan provincial governor Lin Yang-kang and others on a tour of the remote and mountainous Wuchieh area of Nantou County . Chiang has just finished eating , and is enjoying the beautiful scenery of the mountains of central Taiwan . He is obviously in high spirits . Wearing a jacket with just a T-shirt inside , he calls out " Come on , come on !  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Juju Wang , an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Tsing Hua University , notes that all of the central government agencies are located up north in Taipei . The city has two-thirds of the island 's universities , over 90 percent of the corporate headquarters , and over 90 percent of its media . The magnetic draw of Taipei has made it an over-loaded city with a deteriorating environment - " a poor place to live amid great wealth . "  
At the National Development Conference , Huang was a major proponent of freezing provincial elections . Since becoming minister of the interior he has worried the provincial government by stating , " The provincial government was established by the central government , and has no status as an independent legal entity . "  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
Sitting in the central hall , with the Lotus Flower Pool and Mt . Kuanyin in front of you and the rear courtyard and the ancestral memorial tablet behind , nestled between sky and earth , mountain and river , amid the deepening twilight , a sense of the eternity of the ancestors and yourself will flood through your body , as myriad thoughts of extraordinary people and times past well up into your mind .  
The pampas country of central Argentina enjoys abundant rainfall and has rich , fertile soil which can be farmed intensively without irrigation . The region is suitable for both arable farming and stock rearing , and is famous as one of the world 's granaries .  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
From 1957 on , the central government appointed three consecutive governors with military backgrounds . Behind this pattern was a tense military standoff with mainland China , which shelled the island of Kinmen heavily in 1958 . A number of projects designed to promote political stability and ensure economic and social survival and development were completed during these years .  
With regard to the organizational structure of the provincial government , Professor Cheng states that during the years when military men filled the governorship , administrative powers were highly concentrated in the hands of the central government . In 1967 , the city of Taipei came under the direct jurisdiction of the central government , whereas before it had been under the provincial government . In cities under the provincial government , the chief administrators of municipal districts , who had formerly been chosen by direct elections , also began to be appointed . The locals rule  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
In 1930 , aborigines in the area of Wushe stormed a sports day at the local school , killing over 100 Japanese , including policemen and teachers . The motivation for the attack was anger at Japan 's repressive policies for " governing the barbarians , " by which the authorities endeavored to requisition territory and exploit the forestry resources of Taiwan 's central highlands . Under these policies , the culture and traditional ways of life of aboriginal tribes were effectively outlawed , and those that resisted were massacred .  
In future manual butchering will have to give way to mechanized slaughtering with electric stunning . The well over 100,000 chickens and ducks consumed in Greater Taipei each day will also have to be slaughtered electrically close to the farms in central and southern Taiwan , to reduce the suffering they now endure when transported tightly packed in cages .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
In fact , I 'm furious with it , but what can I do ? " The leaders of 23 local governments signed a petition demanding that the central government allocate still more of the Tax Redistribution Fund to them . " The petition was immediately supported by everyone , regardless of party affiliation , and regardless of whether they were on Taiwan proper or its outlying islands . "  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office .

The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
Such efforts should be pursued in close cooperation with community and religious leaders and non-governmental organizations , at all levels of the State , i.e . national , regional , zonal and woreda levels , and special emphasis should be placed on the need to coordinate the policies designed to implement the Convention between central and local authorities .

Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .

A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
The financial sector , however , continues to be viewed as deserving of special consideration because of its central role in the national economy and the far-reaching damage that financial disruption , caused for instance by imprudent lending or unanticipated changes in prices , can produce in the domestic economy .  
International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
One of the principal reasons cited for the current situation of human rights in Afghanistan was the lack of central power , governmental institutions , unified legal system and a clear social , political and economic system .

Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
Noting with concern that the absence of central authority and effective civil institutions that characterizes Somalia continues to impede sustained comprehensive development and that , while the environment has become conducive to some reconstruction and development-oriented work in certain parts of the country , the humanitarian and security situation has remained fragile in other parts ,  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
Indeed , since the beginning of this decade , each of the global conferences which have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations from the Children \ x { e5b8 } Summit , held in 1990 , to the Conference on Human Settlements , held in Istanbul in 1996 has drawn a link between its own central theme and the pervasive issue of poverty and how its structural causes are to be addressed .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
Future activities envisaged by the resource committee on correctional systems and rights include a model seminar using the Manual for other central and eastern European States , the use of selected parts of the Manual in a seminar on prisoners rights for African participants , a joint initiative with Penal Reform International and an international symposium planned for the third quarter of 1997 .

Instead , a bleak cluster of grey buildings with large underground detention cells , characterized by a stench emanating from wet blankets spread on dirty stone floors in cells meant for three , but , according to the police , accommodating up to eight at times , provides a stark contrast to the visible efforts made at creating user _ friendly environments at police stations in , for example , the central Pretoria area .  
In this regard , the Group expressed particular concern over the Israeli decision on 26 February 1997 to build a new settlement in Jabal abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem , which constitutes the latest attempt by Israel at pre-empting the outcome of the negotiations on final status by changing the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem - a city which is of central importance to the Arab world and the world of Islam , the three major religions , as well as the international community in general . 
The central themes of the discussions were the following : the promotion of cooperation in law enforcement and the exchange of information on drug traffickers ; harmonization of various bilateral , multilateral and regional approaches to controlling substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the legislative frameworks , so as to facilitate the worldwide exchange of information on suspicious transactions involving such substances ; and the eradication of illicit crops and the development of programmes to advance crop substitution and alternative development projects .  
Given the central importance of Jerusalem to the Palestinian people , to the entire Arab and Muslim nation , to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and to the international community as a whole , the Council 's inaction stands in stark contrast to the collective position of the international community , as reflected in the Council , the great potential damage of Israel 's decision , its impact on the Middle East peace process , and the great harm wrought by the failure of the Council to adopt this draft resolution .

In addition to the economic shocks , the legacy of communist rule in these countries was probably much more unfavourable than in central Europe : more ruthless regimes ensured that there was little , if any , reform before 1989 , and there was little opportunity for the emergence of opposition parties which might have developed coherent alternative programmes when eventually presented with the opportunity of taking over Government .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .

In central and eastern Europe , UNDCP will support further development of the Subregional Drug Control Cooperation Programme on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed at Prague in 1995 , initiated to provide a comprehensive response to drug-control challenges posed by east-west and south-north illicit trafficking and growing drug abuse .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
The first involves persistent organic pollutants that bioaccumulate , possibly causing cancer , reproductive disorders , damage to central and peripheral nervous systems and diseases of the immune system , and interfering with infant and child development .  
We also support the proposal to elaborate a comprehensive international legal instrument against transnational organized crime , which plays a central role in promoting illegal drug use and its attendant activities .  
Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have " dualistic economies " , with the existence of great disparities between rich and poor , urban and rural areas , and central and peripheral geographic zones .
