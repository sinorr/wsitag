We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality , and we call upon the States of the world :  
Although the Croatian authorities are trying to assure the remaining Serbs that they are welcome to stay in Croatia , the Special Rapporteur has received numerous reports suggesting that in fact their continued residence in Croatia is not welcome .  During her mission to the former Sector North , the Special Rapporteur met with some elderly and disabled Serbs who reported being constantly harassed and attacked by uniformed men and civilians .  
Certainly , the human tragedy of this continuing matter is enormous both in terms of any remaining detainees who are no doubt suffering untold emotional anguish and possibly enduring physical hardship and in terms of the relatives of the missing persons who are suffering severe mental distress because they are without knowledge of the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones .

Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the people of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .  
The representative reported on the Government 's priorities and future plans in implementing the Convention , including strengthening the national machinery for women ; vocational training for women and educational and awareness-raising efforts among teachers ; expansion of child care ; supplementing the recently reformed family law and the remaining legal instruments that involved unequal treatment of women ; improvements for rural women ; prevention of violence against women ; women 's participation in decision-making ; and possible creation of an equal opportunities commission .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 50 / 39 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and facilitating the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
While adhering to the principles inherent in the Declaration , the Special Committee has in recent years considered the question of decolonization in a more realistic and pragmatic manner , taking into account the prevailing international situation as well as recognizing the specific requirements and conditions that exist in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
With the prospects of any major breakthrough remaining bleak at this time , my delegation appeals to the parties to refrain from any actions that might exasperate this already dangerous and volatile situation , which is poignantly portrayed in deplorable humanitarian conditions in which looting , beatings and torture have become an intolerable aspect of everyday life for many people .

In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
The technical and professional posts remaining in the Department for Development Support and Management Services were to constitute the minimal critical mass needed to provide substantive support to overall planning and management activities in mineral resources in line with the mandate of the Department .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
Decides further , as an ad hoc and exceptional arrangement , that Member States shall waive their respective shares in the remaining credits arising from previous budgets of the United Nations Protection Force in an amount of 8,455,336 dollars gross ( 8,601,911 dollars net ) , to be transferred to the Special Account for the International Tribunal from the Special Account for the United Nations Protection Force established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46 / 233 of 19 March 1992 ;

Also requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to strengthen existing measures of support and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Iraq is under international obligation to waste no time in registering the remaining Iranian prisoners of war about whose detention in Iraq ample evidence exists , and for providing that list to the Iranian authorities as agreed upon at Tehran on 14 September 1995 , and thereby paving the way for a final solution to this outstanding and sad humanitarian issue .

Having noted that the tentative programme of work for the period 9-17 December 1996 included three sets of informal consultations on the question of human resources management , his delegation wondered whether , if no tangible progress was made during the first round of consultations , the remaining time slots could be devoted to other priority items .  
The extension of UNAVEM 's mandate until 28 February 1997 will provide the Angolans with an additional chance to accomplish the remaining military and political tasks foreseen in the Lusaka Protocol and to establish the basis for a peaceful , united and prosperous Angola .  
It is our hope that 1997 will see the progressive diminution of the remaining tensions and suspicions , and the fostering of a spirit of constructive and positive cooperation between the different communities , from which can grow lasting stability and economic prosperity based on mutual respect , democracy and the rule of law .  
After consulting with our partners in the Steering Group , Canada has now concluded that , with the return to Rwanda of the majority of refugees , the dispersal of the remaining number over large areas of eastern Zaire and the growing access of international humanitarian agencies to the remaining refugees , displaced persons and civilians at risk , the multinational force at the current authorized force level has very little utility .  
The remaining issues could be divided into two categories : the procedural or technical ones could be addressed during the nine weeks of further work recommended by the Preparatory Committee ; and the substantive issues requiring high-level political decisions could be finally resolved only at the conference .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership .

In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May . The people of Sierra Leone have responded to the coup in a manner unique in the history of Africa .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
While there is not yet a universally accepted definition of terrorism _ academics and experts tending to approach the phenomenon from varying perspectives , and Governments tending to label as acts of terrorism manifestations of the phenomenon which directly affect their own interests while remaining unconcerned about the emergencies of others _ admittedly , one of the major difficulties standing in the way of consensus has been the continuing controversy about wars of national liberation and the motives advanced to justify violence .  
We urge the Government of Angola , and in particular UNITA , to make haste and complete the remaining political and military aspects of the peace process , including the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory in accordance with the agreed timetable and procedures ; the transformation of the UNITA radio station into a non-partisan broadcasting facility ; the registration and demobilization of all remaining military elements ; the elimination of all obstacles to the free circulation of people and goods ; and the disarmament of the civilian population .

To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .

Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .

With regard to the military observers , their presence in Angola during the coming months will continue to be required for the verification of the implementation of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol , the monitoring of the formation of the unified army and the demobilization of excess UNITA and FAA soldiers , as well as verification and investigation of allegations concerning the residual presence of UNITA armed elements and the existence of weapons caches .

Croatia 's position is that , with the successful holding of elections , UNTAES has completed the executive part of its mandate : authority over the region should therefore be transferred to Croatia , the UNTAES military component should be withdrawn and the remaining United Nations civilian presence restricted to a monitoring and observation mission pending its replacement by a long-term OSCE observation mission .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .
