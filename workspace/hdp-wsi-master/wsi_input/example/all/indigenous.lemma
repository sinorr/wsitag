Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
" By bringing together companies from other economies , researchers in our tertiary institutions and local enterprises with scientific and technological competence , the science park will provide a major impetus for the development of indigenous science and technology-based companies in Hong Kong , " he said , adding that it would also promote technology transfer by attracting overseas investment and enhance regional co-operation in this area .  
To implement the aforesaid principles , a " lawful successor " is defined in the Ordinance to mean " a person , male or female , who on the death of an indigenous villager is or becomes entitled to an interest in the estate of the deceased by lawful succession and which person is a descendant through the male line of the deceased " .  
Local DSC playing Chinese music in western rock style , has given them the most indigenous face of all rock bands in Hong Kong . They also interpret traditional ethnic music with varying musical elements , which has earned them numerous awards on the way .  
( a ) whether the authorities have , over the past three financial years , objected to applications from these owners to the Town Planning Board for land development or change in land use for development or rejected applications from indigenous residents of the New Territories for building small houses on private land , on the ground that the land concerned is reserved for infrastructure or housing projects ; if so , of the details of the relevant policies in this regard and the respective numbers of applications objected to or rejected over the above period ; and  
In exporting ducks and their down , the most intractable problems are associated with color and quarantine regulations in foreign countries . Taiwan 's indigenous ducks are usually black or brown , and the feathers leave black roots after the bird is plucked , which are unattractive to customers .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
The pestle music of the Bunun , which is played before the rice harvest , was originally intended to attract people from neighboring villages to come and share in the crop . Rice is n't planted much any more , but the performance still shows the tribe 's solidarity and generous spirit of sharing , qualities worth cherishing by indigenous people and outsiders alike .  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
Except for a thin stretch of western Taiwan 's coastline settled by Chuanchow and Changchow Fukienese and a few Pingpu indigenous peoples , Shen was welcomed only by deep , forbidding mountains . The Han Chinese living on the coast called these " Fanshan , " or " savage mountains . "  
With the December sun shining as if it were the first day of spring back in the interior , he decided to change the name of the place where he settled - - previously called Lang-chiao in the Paiwan language - - to " Hengchun , " meaning " eternal spring . " He went on to open up the mountains and subdue the indigenous people , taking the peninsula from the era of being an aboriginal stronghold to the " Hengchun " era .  
Now that attacking had become more of a challenge , the indigenous people organized 18 settlements together for a joint assault . The residents , fearing the aborigines would set the city wan alight , stacked up tens of oxcarts to build another wall outside the original one , and , after a fierce battle , finally pushed the attackers back into the hills .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
There is greater flexibility in the forward progress of the experimental classes . Teachers can design instructional activities to meet the needs of the curriculum . For example , in the Chinese language class on " Kung Jung Takes the Smallest Pear , " the teacher got the kids to put on a little drama . For a third year lesson in the standardized texts on the aboriginal " Harvest Festival , " the Tatun Primary School invited the Formosan Aboriginal Dance Troupe to perform traditional indigenous song and dance at the school .  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
Given the recent favor bestowed in Taiwan on things " native , " the music and dance of Taiwan 's aboriginal peoples have been staged as an art form , and groups of indigenous people have formed aboriginal dance troupes . Using anthropological methodology , they have studied and recorded the disappearing songs and steps of every indigenous community .  
An even more noteworthy feature of their culture is that they typically buried the dead sideways with knees bent , and the burial site was not far from their homes , meaning that even when Ketagalans passed away , they were not forsaken by their relatives or society . They still received attention and remained in their loved ones ' memory . This is somewhat similar to what we know from oral history of the funerary customs of other indigenous people .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
Major groups , such as women , the private sector , indigenous peoples , and others represented through a wide array of nongovernmental organizations , are critical to ensuring broad public participation in sustainable development .  
The meeting urged subregional and regional banking / financial institutions to channel the greater part of their resources towards the private sector , creating indigenous capital markets , rather than depend on the existing ones controlled by foreign interests .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
The raising of awareness about indigenous peoples must be seen not as the task of a Year but as part of the ongoing and permanent process of education and public information about human rights and the urgent need to protect and strengthen cultural diversity .  
The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights of national minorities and indigenous peoples and has established a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea . But for Ukraine , which faces conditions of economic crisis and a complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary infrastructure , services and mechanisms , the task of accommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated persons appears too complicated .  
To attain the objectives of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , Ecuador , a multi-ethnic country , has submitted various concrete programmes and initiatives , in consultation with national indigenous organizations , designed to improve the economic , social and cultural status of those groups while fully respecting their distinctive characteristics .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
The objective is to provide for the land requirements of human settlement development through environmentally sound physical planning and land use so as to ensure access to land to all households and , where appropriate , the encouragement of communally and collectively owned and managed land .  6 / Particular attention should be paid to the needs of women and indigenous people for economic and cultural reasons .  
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Governments , with the participation of the private sector , non-governmental organizations , local community groups , indigenous people , women , local government units and the public at large , should act to maintain and expand the existing vegetative cover wherever ecologically , socially and economically feasible , through technical cooperation and other forms of support .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
The World Conference recognized the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society and strongly reaffirms the commitment of the international community to their economic , social and cultural well-being and their enjoyment of the fruits of sustainable development .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
In reply to a question about concrete steps the Government had taken to raise the living standards of indigenous women , the representative said that the Government had primarily directed its efforts to supporting the basic needs of rural women .  
Protecting the [ traditional ] rights to land and other resources of pastoralists , fishery workers and nomadic and indigenous people and strengthening land management in areas of pastoral or nomadic activity , building on traditional communal practices , controlling encroachment by others , and developing improved systems of range management and access to water , markets , credit , animal production , veterinary services , health including health services , education and information ;  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
The devastating effects of short-fallow shifting cultivation are often not the work of mountain people , but of landless lowland farmers moving farther up into mountain areas as squatters in search of " unoccupied " land and applying lowland production techniques unsuited to complex upland realms .  42 .  Sustainable mountain development in many places has to start with a change in attitude towards indigenous people and in the way they are treated .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Recommends for this purpose that a second technical meeting on the planning of the Decade be convened immediately prior to the thirteenth session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations , to be supported from within existing budgetary resources , and urges Governments , United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and , in particular , indigenous people 's organizations to participate actively in that meeting , in accordance with agreed procedures ;  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Concerning the proposals for action , the Working Group suggested that the Commission consider encouraging countries , with the support of the international community , to prepare and initiate implementation of comprehensive national mountain development programmes and to strengthen national capacity for sustainable mountain development using a participatory approach involving all stakeholders , including local and indigenous communities and non-governmental organizations .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
Recognition of the identity of the indigenous peoples is fundamental to the construction of a national unity based on respect for and the exercise of political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans .  
Incorporate the educational concepts of the Maya and other indigenous peoples , particularly in the philosophical , scientific , artistic , pedagogical , historical , linguistic and socio-political areas , as part of the overall reform of the educational system ;  
Regulate and support a system of informational , scientific , artistic and educational programmes on indigenous cultures in their languages , through the national radio , television and the written media .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
They are , inter alia , rights to equality of treatment and non-discrimination ; such cultural rights as the right to use indigenous languages , to use indigenous dress and to practise indigenous forms of spirituality ; such civil and political rights as the rights to practise traditional indigenous forms of social organization ; and such economic and social rights as the right to hold land under traditional forms of tenure .  
In the Agreement , the Government has committed itself to the effective protection of indigenous rights by promoting the creation of legal offices for the defence of those rights and the establishment of " popular law offices " to provide free legal assistance to persons of limited economic means in municipalities in which indigenous communities are prevalent .  
APINESS was set up in 1986 with a view to providing national-level academic groups in the social sciences field appropriate , relevant and pertinent international as well as indigenous data , documentation and information , so that professionals in the field of social sciences may meaningfully contribute to national development .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
In particular , the main purposes of the Decade were lost among initiatives of limited scope or proposals to establish direct communication links between the United Nations system and indigenous communities , without due regard to the legitimate role of national Governments as the appropriate channel for international cooperation .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The Working Group considers that participation should be extended to indigenous peoples and to ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , youth and children and that the elderly should also be considered as active agents in all the processes of formulation , implementation and monitoring of development programmes .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , the Prime Minister of Fiji had stressed the importance of working to redress some of the wrongs that history had wrought upon indigenous peoples and guaranteeing that external values and forces did not continue to impose political concessions , economic reforms and social changes that were not desired by indigenous people themselves .  
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

a decision adopted on 28 April 1995 , the High Council of the Republic , the transitional parliament , bearing in mind all the adverse consequences for the Zairians which resulted from the presence of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi , including ecological problems , criminal acts and attempts to dominate the indigenous inhabitants , had decided to demand the unconditional return , without delay , of all refugees and immigrants from those countries .  
was unacceptable that many were unable to enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms , and it was essential that the international community should be aware of that , in order to make every effort to secure the enjoyment of those rights for indigenous people .  
Solutions to the problems faced by indigenous people must be worked out with their full participation and on the basis of full respect for their human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and identity .  
The standards on indigenous rights to be elaborated by the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights should promote peaceful and constructive solutions based on the principles of multicultural societies , inter-ethnic understanding and harmony and tolerance .  Respect for the rights of indigenous people did not prejudice the territorial integrity of States , but strengthened it and prevented violent conflicts .  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
Cooperation and assistance can take a variety of forms , including joint ventures with local entrepreneurs in mining and the provision of ancillary supplies and services ; initiating complementary work and marketing relationships with indigenous small-scale producers ; lending expertise to both the Government and producers ; voluntarily returning marginal or small deposits to the national mineral inventory ; and joint or sole sponsoring of demonstration projects , training programmes or mining schools .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
To strengthen the institutional capacity of Governments and communities for the development , utilization and commercialization of new and renewable energy sources ; to develop national and indigenous capacity in assessment and management of energy resources and services ; to introduce changes in energy consumption patterns , focusing on conservation measures and demand-side management ; to facilitate international and interregional connections for the transmission of electric power and transport of natural gas ; and to promote technology transfer to different levels of government , civil society , community institutions and entrepreneurs .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
The system is based on the criterion of rationalizing the use of State penal power by offering such options as : ( a ) punishing crime that has a high social cost and reducing the severity of punishment for less serious crimes ; ( b ) avoiding discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors , such as women and indigenous people ; ( c ) scrupulously respecting constitutional guarantees such as the principles of legality and guilt ; and ( d ) guaranteeing the rational and egalitarian implementation of the law .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
In accordance with the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space concerning the development of indigenous capabilities , General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in which the Assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that the United Nations should lead , with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations , an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology in existing national / regional educational institutions in the developing countries , and resolution 50 / 27  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Realizing the increasingly important role of indigenous people and youth in solving the major problems facing humankind and the need to provide them with broader opportunities to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , cultural , spiritual and moral life of their peoples , as partners in development ,  
Their traditional knowledge as regards the identification and use of medicinal plants , animals and minerals must be protected , and where this knowledge is commercialized and applied for profit without their consent , Governments concerned must consult the indigenous people from whom such knowledge has been taken , on whether they want to be compensated and if they so desire , the Governments concerned shall assist them in securing due compensation .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
In the spirit of cooperative linkages for joint exploration of human potentials , we agree to focus on partnership actions that clarify , interpret , create , protect and promote socio-legal , political , economic , educational , cultural , moral and spiritual processes affecting the abilities of indigenous people and youth to choose , maintain , access , encourage , manage and actualize their diverse ways of achieving just and humane growth and development .  
For the moment , he has observed that since its colonization , Colombia has experienced persistent racial discrimination : the indigenous population and Black people have been marginalized , and live in deplorable economic and social conditions - they are the poorest groups .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
That concern arose from their commitment to decolonization and the rights of the indigenous Kanaks , including the preservation and promotion of their social and cultural values , which had been reflected in the South Pacific Forum vision statement and the " Melanesia beyond 2000 " strategy which declared that the four Member States and the Front de lib �� ation nationale Kanake socialiste ( FLNKS ) were determined to support the orderly decolonization of New Caledonia with special safeguards for the indigenous Kanaks .  
Expert seminars have been held on the effects of racism and racial discrimination on the social and economic relations between indigenous peoples and States ( Geneva , 1989 ) , on schemes of internal self-government for indigenous peoples ( Nuuk , 1991 ) , on practical experience in the realization of sustainable and environmentally sound self-development of indigenous peoples ( Santiago , 1992 ) , and on practical experiences regarding indigenous land rights and claims ( Whitehorse , 1996 ) .  
In 1991 , the World Bank issued a revised policy which extends its own definition of indigenous people to include a much wider array of groups that maintain cultural and social identities distinct from those of the national societies where they live , have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The project consisted of an inter-agency mission by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , FAO , UNIDO , and UNESCO to provide an integrated package of policy advice to the Government on : ( i ) integrating environment and development at all levels of the decision-making process ; ( ii ) an integrated approach to the management of renewable and non-renewable natural resources ; ( iii ) strengthening mechanisms for effective indigenous people 's participation in decision-making ; ( iv ) capacity-building for villages , communities , and grass-root non-governmental organizations .  
The survey produced written and oral responses from individuals and delegations covering well over half of the total 232 indigenous participants at the Working Group session , reflecting their geographical diversity and a broad range of experience of the United Nations system .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .  
Such conferences include the World Summit for Social Development , 10 / held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , which stated that it recognized and supported indigenous people in their pursuit of economic and social development , with full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural values .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
It is possible without unnecessary infringement of sovereign prerogatives of States to encourage indigenous non-governmental organizations , supported when necessary by independent and impartial international non-governmental organizations , to initiate timely action .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
The proclamation of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People reflected the commitment of the international community to promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous people , especially their economic , social and cultural well-being .  
The recent Administrative Decentralization Act provided a mechanism for indigenous and peasant communities to make their needs known to the central Government through local governments ; other legal measures had brought indigenous people into the national social security system and formalized their territorial rights .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
He hoped that the Decade 's programme of activities would be implemented fully and that problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health would be solved effectively through efforts at the national level and greater international cooperation .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Please provide information on the measures adopted , including at the legislative , administrative , educational , budgetary and social levels , to ensure that a child belonging to an ethnic , religious or linguistic minority or who is indigenous is not denied the right , in community with other members of his or her group :  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
National level criteria and indicators should be formulated through a transparent process involving all [ relevant ] [ interested ] parties , including forest owners , [ native forest dwellers and NGOs ] [ forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities , as well as major groups , where applicable ] .  
A wide programme of eradication of coca plants , poppies and marijuana crops continued to be carried out , and continued efforts were being made to obtain additional resources through international cooperation to complement those already invested in the country 's alternative development programme , which constituted an economically sustainable solution for peasant and indigenous families , and a long-term solution for elimination of the illicit supply of drugs .  
Mechanisms should continue to be developed within the United Nations to give the nominated representatives of indigenous organizations and peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice and take part in decision-making in the search for solutions to the problems faced by their peoples .  At its fifty _ second session , the Commission , by decision 1996 / 102 , established an agenda item entitled Indigenous issues .  
As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
The main objective of chapter 26 is to establish full partnerships between Governments , international organizations and indigenous people . 14 Proposals to achieve the main objective include establishing processes that empower indigenous people ; strengthening the active participation of indigenous people in the formulation of national policies related to resource management ; and involving indigenous people at the national and local levels in programmes related to sustainable development .  
The latter includes establishing appropriate national policies and legal instruments ; protection of indigenous lands from environmentally unsound activities ; recognition of indigenous values , knowledge and resource management practices ; development of national dispute settlement arrangements ; and enhancement of capacity-building for indigenous communities .  Key : forward ; backward ; unchanged ; ? unclear .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
The many initiatives which had subsequently led to the drafting of new instruments were considered by delegations as particularly valuable , as was the exploration of especially critical problems encountered in the modern world , including attention to issues in the field of social and economic rights , such as the right to housing , extreme poverty and indigenous rights . 
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , with a view to enabling the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , as well as others , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 15 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system . 
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a more fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
Other practices are the use of indigenous objects like the buho or bamboo in cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn baby instead of unnatural objects , like scissors , the use of which , it is believed , will influence the child to be disloyal to the family and the hanging of dried umbilical cord pusod of a newborn baby beneath the doorway or window in the belief that this will keep the infant safe from accident or harm .  
He agreed that there should not be a single legal definition of indigenous peoples at the international level at this time , although a definition might be required at the national level .  
An indigenous participant from South America reported on some activities carried on in the field of indigenous rights and human rights : seminars and workshops had been organized and a number of publications had been distributed with a view to improving understanding of international legal instruments regarding indigenous peoples and monitoring their implementation .  
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .  The guidelines included several aspects : prior informed consent and consultation with indigenous peoples ;  
Two representatives from North and South America respectively complained about the role of the United Nations which was considered to be too weak ; one of them lamented the paternalistic approach of the United Nations towards indigenous issues ; the other stressed the need for the United Nations to take a more active role along with its speciliazed agencies , in particular as far as the voluntary funds were concerned .  
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
International Corporations should negotiate with the indigenous communities a just and fair profit _ sharing arrangement , prior to signing of any kind of agreement , and with full disclosure of the projected profit and complete development plans for the relevant project , to ensure that the peoples concerned receive an equitable profit share and / or compensation package .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Deeply concerned that understanding of human nature has been significantly modified by the rapid rise of developments in biotechnology as a science , particularly in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes , and that indigenous people are most vulnerable to the risk of being singled out for human genetic research and human gene patenting by the biotechnology industry ,  
Takes note of the work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in the field of the human genome to complete the preliminary draft of a universal declaration on the human genome and human rights , a standard _ setting framework urgently needed to ensure that such research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human dignity , in particular for the dignity and way of life of indigenous peoples ;  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
In that connection , an expert group headed by the Minister of Justice and composed of representatives of governmental agencies , non-governmental and indigenous organizations and scientists and academics had been set up to elaborate a national policy with regard to indigenous people and to contribute to the lawmaking process in that new area of national legislation .  
His Government had worked tirelessly to set aside almost 1-million square kilometres - more than a tenth of the national territory - for the 330,000 indigenous people living in Brazil , a process that had required the adoption of special legislation to ensure its constitutionality . 
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 163 of 21 December 1993 in which it proclaimed the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People ( 1995-2004 ) , stated that the Decade 's main objective was to strengthen international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .  
Many governmental representatives also stated that it is not necessary to arrive at a universal definition of indigenous peoples in the context of the draft United Nations declaration , although some Governments recognized the concerns of countries with complex ethnic and historical circumstances .  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
History has shown that the huge present-day inequalities between developed and poor countries are the result of centuries of plundering and exploitation during which civilizations , social structures and indigenous modes of production were destroyed and during which the ecosystems of Africa , America and Asia were pillaged .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Gender discrimination was often practised against specific social groups , such as migrant workers , especially undocumented " illegal " workers coming from " poor " countries , including indigenous women .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
The permanent forum for indigenous peoples could not only foster national _ level development partnerships in areas such as medicine , agriculture and conservation , but also international partnerships that will have a regional or worldwide economic impact .  
The need to set indigenous language literacy teaching within a well _ defined legal , administrative , financial and technical framework would appear to be self _ evident .  
While the latter issue affects any participating individual and community , indigenous populations arguably have minimal access to the legal advice and political power necessary to secure an outcome satisfactory to them .  
The representative stated that women living in rural areas , particularly those belonging to indigenous groups , remained marginalized and had higher rates of maternal mortality , adolescent pregnancy and illiteracy than women living in Perus urban centres .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
While his delegation appreciated the contributions of States to voluntary funds and fellowships for indigenous populations , the overall amounts involved were wholly inadequate for the realization of their social , economic and political development needs . 
The right to an adequate standard of living is recognized in Australia , and supported by a system of social welfare which protects the most disadvantaged in society _ the unemployed , the sick , the elderly , indigenous peoples and people with disabilities .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous people have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous people to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Another indigenous representative from Oceania recognized that , despite difficulties , some progress had been made in indigenous health conditions and that traditional cultural , social and spiritual needs were addressed in close cooperation with local groups .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous people have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous people to their lands , territories and resources ,  
This body would offer the indigenous peoples a window on the world , enabling them to assert their rights , whether civil , cultural , economic , political or social , before the international community .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
A number of oral and written statements were submitted to the Subcommission on various issues , such as the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , right to development , religious intolerance , protection of minorities , indigenous persons , and terrorism and human rights . 
Article 8 ( j ) is also directly related to three other provisions of the Convention : article 10 ( c ) , dealing with customary use of biological resources ; article 17.2 , dealing with exchange of information relevant to indigenous and traditional knowledge ; and articles 18.4 and 15 , dealing with technical and scientific cooperation , including indigenous and traditional technologies and access to genetic resources , respectively .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
National plans of action for human rights education , which have been called for both by the General Assembly and the Commission , are intended to be an integral part of the national development plan ( when applicable ) and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( general human rights plans of action or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
It was said that members could be elected or appointed for a limited period of time on a rotating basis , and they could serve either in an official or in a personal capacity , in particular indigenous representatives stated that the status of the representatives should be equal . 
Many indigenous representatives expressed the view that the forum should be established as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council , while other indigenous representatives considered that it should be linked to the Economic and Social Council , in one way or another , although they were not in a position to identify the exact placement in the system at the current time .  
The representative of Paraguay expressed support for the creation of a permanent forum which would coordinate , promote and advise on all issues regarding indigenous peoples , including their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights . 
In a joint statement , the Saami Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference stated that the forum should be established as a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council and should be composed of an equal number of representatives of indigenous peoples and Governments , acting as full voting members on an equal basis .  
The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .  
In addition , sample surveys and qualitative studies , such as the rapid assessment approach , are common sources for data on a large number of economic , social and demographic issues ; but they are not always large enough to provide reliable estimates on indicators for smaller population groups , such as indigenous populations , or on characteristics such as disability that affect a very small proportion of the population ;  
Human services , such as basic education and health care , technical and continuing education , information and extension services , care for the young , old and disabled and programmes to reduce marginalization of migrant , indigenous and other disadvantaged groups , are principally provided through public outlays in most countries .  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
We are deeply concerned at the situation of human rights in Mexico , where the same methods are being applied as were used in our country , like the establishment of paramilitary groups , selective assassination and the extermination of civic and popular leaders of the indigenous and peasant communities .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance to indigenous societies of their lands , territories and resources for their continued survival and vitality .  
Rodolfo Stavenhagen states that the entire population of the Americas decreased by 95 per cent in the century and a half following the first encounter .  10 / The intent to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity and bring them under the sovereignty of foreign monarchs created widespread havoc , despite some early attempts at friendly treatment .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the Sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 22 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system .  
Queensland , ruled that the doctrine of terra nullius may not be applied to deny indigenous rights to land , but nonetheless confirmed the power of the Sovereign to extinguish native title .  32 / The Court held that native title may be extinguished , but only by legislation , by the alienation of land by the Crown or by the appropriation of the land by the Crown in a manner inconsistent with the continuation of native title .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
It called upon members and associate members that have not yet done so to set up and strengthen national mechanisms on ageing , inter alia , to enable them to coordinate the observance of the International Year of Older Persons , and to set specific time-bound targets on ageing and related issues , in the light of the needs and aspirations of older persons , in keeping with indigenous traditions and their milieux .  
Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
In addition , these contradictions place a formidable burden on the formulation and realization of future negotiated legal instruments between indigenous peoples and States : the difficulties of negotiating those new instruments without having previously identified and settled key questions need not be stressed .  
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .  
First and foremost , it must be pointed out that , at present and with very few exceptions - national and international legal texts having a bearing on the living conditions of indigenous peoples are enacted and enforced by State institutions without direct indigenous input .  
Any attempt , at the end of the twentieth century , to arrive at a general approach to the vast , complex , and more than 500 _ year _ old problematique of the indigenous peoples , should not - and can not - ignore a fundamental fact : their initial contacts with non-indigenous peoples from other parts of the world , dating back to the late fifteenth century , were the result of the launching and development of European colonial expansion . 
As a direct result of decolonization , the gap left by the non-indigenous colonial political powers in those continents has been filled by population sectors whose indigenous ( or autochthonous ) condition is indisputable by any of todays standards .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
It is not possible to understand this process of gradual but incessant erosion of the indigenous peoples ' original sovereignty , without considering and , indeed , highlighting the role played by juridical tools , always arm in arm with the military component of the colonial enterprise .  
It is easy to see the negative effects for indigenous peoples of such a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors , not only on their initial sovereign condition , but also on their overall international juridical status .  
It is not the task of the Special Rapporteur in this final report to describe in detail the harsh impact on indigenous peoples of being subjected to a new and totally alien social , economic , and political _ juridical order .  
The process that took the indigenous peoples lands from them left behind very limited and debilitating alternatives for survival : vassalage ( or servitude in its diverse forms ) , segregation in reduced areas reserved for them , or assimilation into the non-indigenous sector of the new socio _ political entity created without indigenous input .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .  
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
In addition , the outline identified three main sources that were to guide both the process of data gathering and his conclusions and recommendations : public international law ; the municipal law of present-day States ( including decisions by municipal courts ) ; and indigenous juridical views ( in particular , on societal authority , treaties , and treaty-making in general ) .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
Owing to their special relationship , spiritual and material , with their lands , the Special Rapporteur believes that very little or no progress can be made in this regard without tackling , solving and redressing - in a way acceptable to the indigenous peoples concerned - the question of their uninterrupted dispossession of this unique resource , vital to their lives and survival .  
On the basis of a vast amount of documentation , the work of the Working Group and oral testimony , the Special Rapporteur has reached the conclusion that there is an almost unanimous opinion among geographically-dispersed indigenous peoples that existing State mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , are unable to satisfy their aspirations and hopes for redress .  
As a result of his research , the Special Rapporteur has ample proof that indigenous peoples / nations who have entertained treaty relationships with non-indigenous settlers and their continuators strongly argue that those instruments not only continue to be valid and applicable to their situation today but are a key element for their survival as distinct peoples .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
He first recommends the establishment within States with a sizeable indigenous population of an entirely new , special jurisdiction to deal exclusively with indigenous issues , independent of existing governmental ( central or otherwise ) structures , although financed by public funds , that will gradually replace the existing bureaucratic / administrative government branches now in charge of those issues .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Two main issues will be addressed : ( i ) the legal and practical implications of the constitutional provisions relevant to indigenous and tribal peoples , and ( ii ) increasing cooperation between and among government officials , national and international organizations , and indigenous and tribal peoples within the framework of Convention No . 169 , which emphasizes consultation and participation .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party and further recommends that it increase measures to reduce economic and social disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
She encouraged a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding between the worlds indigenous peoples and the Governments concerned and expressed the hoped that substantive and practical proposals would be made at the seventeenth session of the Working Group .  
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
He stressed in particular the need for prior consultation and full participation of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of energy projects , for compensation and benefit _ sharing , and for sociocultural impact studies to be integrated into the normal environmental impact assessments .  
She considered the creation of a permanent forum an indispensable next step for indigenous peoples and expressed the hope that within two years a new , innovative coordinating body for indigenous issues within the United Nations system would be realized .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .  
Efforts must be made to harmonize economic and social development , achieve a more equitable distribution of income , promote gender equity and implement proactive social policies , with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable groups , such as children , women , the disabled , the elderly , indigenous persons and the unemployed .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
The structure of the Office consists of the Ombudsman for Indigenous Womens Rights , regional delegates , a coordinating board on which indigenous womens organizations are represented , a consultative council composed of members of the linguistic communities and a governmental support commission composed of representatives of various ministries .  
At the same time , the continuation of the public auction of radio frequencies is still giving rise to discontent and frustration in indigenous organizations , which have no resources with which to buy them and are therefore being deprived of a fundamental medium of expression , particularly in rural areas .  
Mr . Cabactulan ( Philippines ) said that more work was needed on the terms of reference for the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit Sharing in order to ensure that the biological diversity within countries was carefully protected , while at the same time ensuring that such resources were utilized in a manner that fully respected the proprietary rights of indigenous communities and enabled the original developers in developing countries to share the benefits .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
One of his Governments key priorities was to put an end to the social and economic disadvantage faced by its indigenous people and , to that end , in August 1999 Parliament had passed an historic motion of reconciliation expressing deep regret at the injustices and trauma inflicted on the indigenous people and reaffirming a commitment to reconciliation as an important national priority .  
The achievement of the ambitious but realistic goals of the International Decade of the Worlds Indigenous People would not only solve specific problems faced by indigenous peoples but would also make a substantial contribution to the peaceful coexistence of nations , national minorities and ethnic groups .  
Her delegation had always stressed the need to classify ethnic groups in order to facilitate national policies on the rights of national minorities and indigenous people , and believed that the draft declaration should make a distinction between two categories of indigenous groups , those leading a tribal way of life on isolated reservations and those integrated with the rest of society .  
Legislative acts adopted in recent years would make it possible to define the legal field for developing traditional types of economic activity as a basis for ensuring the viability of small indigenous peoples , developing local self-government and establishing relations based on partnership with governmental bodies at various levels .  
The meetings final document stressed the importance of the active involvement of indigenous peoples in the building of the country and in ensuring the stable development in the North of traditional and modern means of production , with protection of the inhabited environment .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
In the document PGR explained the Acteal massacre as the culmination of long-standing and unresolved conflicts between local indigenous communities , and concluded that the authorities had contributed to the increasing tensions and insecurity by failing to take appropriate action to investigate a series of crimes committed in the region before the incident on 22 December 1997 .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
We are of the opinion that the workshops and conferences held on the subject of the permanent forum reveal a consensus in favour of endowing the permanent forum with competence in respect not only of the cultural , economic , social and political rights of the indigenous peoples but also educational and health matters affecting the indigenous peoples , with a view to promoting better services corresponding to their way of life .  
This also would include the development of codes of conduct and frameworks of legislation for the control of invasive and exotic plant and animal species in small island developing States in view of their potential negative impact on indigenous or endemic species .  
The observer for the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru stated that , while considering the draft declaration , special attention should be given to such notions as the recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to define themselves as peoples , the principle of self-determination , the exercise of collective ancestral ownership of land , the sovereignty over natural resources , the legal protection of cultural and intellectual property .  
The observer for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference reiterated support for the draft declaration in its current form which , if adopted , would guarantee the political , social , economic and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and lead to a path of peace based on mutual respect .  
The observer for the Saami Council stated that the draft declaration guaranteed the basic rights and fundamental political and legal rights of indigenous peoples and that it constituted a major breakthrough principally because it underlined the principle of equality for indigenous peoples ; this had usually been denied on the grounds of discrimination . 
All indigenous peoples have a collective and individual right to free , comprehensive and diversified education at all levels and in all forms of basic , middle and higher education in their own languages , including bilingual education .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be broad enough to cover the concerns of indigenous peoples , including cultural , civil , political and economic rights , health issues , the rights of women and children , education , development , the environment , human rights and conflict prevention and resolution ;  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
In its resolution 37-90 of 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly decided that , in accordance with the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , 1 the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be directed towards , among other things , stimulating the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in developing countries .  
The Chairperson-Rapporteur proposed a revised work programme which would not include a time-frame for informal governmental meetings , but would allow for the plenary to be suspended if requested by the participants , whether governmental or indigenous representatives , and when the chairperson considered it useful and a contribution to the process .  
He said he hoped the working group would be able to draft a declaration in which States were encouraged to consider a broad range of autonomy for indigenous groups in managing their local and internal affairs , including economic , social and cultural matters .  
The representative of Australia recognized that the intention of article 3 was to enunciate a key concept in the draft declaration , namely the legitimate aspirations of indigenous peoples to enjoy more direct and meaningful participation in decision-making and political processes and greater autonomy over their own affairs .  
The representative of the Assembly of First Nations emphasized the importance of understanding the spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship indigenous peoples had had with their land , territories and water resources .  
For that reason , the achievement of international recognition for the sacred , basic and fundamental right of indigenous peoples to own , develop , use , control and occupy their traditional lands and resources was imperative and urgent .  
She also said that the draft declarations precise restitution criteria were unnecessarily limiting and , as an example , stated that article 27 could include a number of alternatives for providing fair and just consideration to the satisfaction of the indigenous groups concerned.She proposed that that article should be expanded with a separate provision for providing adequate processes for dealing with land claims .  
He expressed concern at the broad language of article 26 , which seemed to give indigenous peoples the right to ownership of land they had traditionally occupied or otherwise used , but pledged his delegations commitment to continuing to work towards a positive resolution of the language of such a valuable article .  
All indigenous peoples have a collective and individual right to compulsory , free , comprehensive and diversified education at all levels and in all forms of basic , middle and higher education in their own languages , including bilingual education .  
States shall take effective measures , with the full consent of the peoples concerned , to eliminate detrimental attitudes of superiority and racial discrimination and to promote tolerance , understanding and friendly relations between indigenous peoples and segments of the national community .  
Under the international conventions adopted by ILO and pursuant to national labour legislation , indigenous peoples are fully entitled to employment , free choice of employment , satisfactory conditions of employment , medical care and social security , without distinction or discrimination on grounds of race or identity .  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
Forest valuation should reflect the social , cultural , economic and ecological context and consider values that are important to local and / or indigenous communities , private forest owners , gender aspects , and distributional impacts .  
Create permanent national and local working groups that include the participation of Governments , NGOs , womens groups and indigenous peoples to ensure that sexual and reproductive rights are explicitly covered in policies and legal reform .  
In Ecuador , a team of international and national UNV volunteers assisted indigenous communities living in areas afflicted by increasing poverty and environmental degradation .  
Nothing in this declaration may be construed as diminishing or extinguishing existing or future rights indigenous peoples may have or acquire under national or international law ; neither may it be construed as violating universal standards of human rights .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
The political will expressed by the Government to improve the implementation of its international human rights obligations should be seen as a generally hopeful sign of respect for indigenous rights as well and should be commended and encouraged .  
The poor of the subregion included the elderly , children , the disabled , smallscale farmers , unskilled workers , the indigenous population and in some countries femaleheaded households , as well as the underemployed and unemployed .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
Liberalization is not possible in LDCs since indigenous human and technological capacities have to be developed first , supported by the gradual removal of protectionist measures and progressive application of international standards .  
In the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups for instance indigenous people , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with HIV / AIDS .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
In Australia , where , a few decades previously , the Government had abducted over 100,000 aboriginal children in order to place them with white families , discrimination against and segregation of indigenous people continued and their economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to own land , were restricted . 
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;

Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Fully recognize all of the rights of the indigenous peoples in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States ; in concert with them the necessary constitutional , administrative , legislative and judicial reforms must be promoted , including those derived from applicable international instruments ;  
Urge States to adopt or strengthen , as appropriate , national programmes for eradicating poverty among indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and also request that they expand their efforts to foster bilateral , regional and international cooperation in implementing those programmes ;  
Urge States to establish , on the basis of existing statistical information , national programmes , including affirmative action measures , to promote the access of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities to education , medical care and basic social services ;  
Invite States to promote and support the establishment and functioning of enterprises , owned by indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities favouring access to credits and training programmes ;  
Request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a fourth branch within her Office to foster activities to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to promote the rights of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;  
Urge States to discourage advertising that portrays stereotypical or otherwise negative images of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants , and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and to encourage advertising that promotes a broader understanding of these victims of racism and fosters the values of diversity , tolerance and mutual respect ;  
Invite States to take appropriate constitutional , legislative and administrative measures , to foster equality among individuals , indigenous peoples , among people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities whose members are frequently victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , and review existing measures with a view to amending or repealing national legislation and administrative provisions that may give rise to discrimination ;  
Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
Participants considered that the limited space available for indigenous peoples in the media should be used to inform the general public and indigenous communities about what was happening on an international and national level regarding indigenous issues and to create understanding and awareness of indigenous cultures among the general public .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
We recognize and admit that slavery and the slave trade , other forms of servitude , conquest and colonialism were the primary sources and manifestation / a source of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and condemn the injustices that were committed , especially against Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples and stress the need for all States which were engaged in such practices to acknowledge the grave human suffering they caused and the heinous racist acts committed ;  
We fully recognize all of the rights of the indigenous peoples , in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States , and that , in consultation with indigenous peoples , the necessary constitutional , administrative , legislative and judicial reforms must be promoted , including those derived from applicable international instruments ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , the development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Urges States to establish national programmes to promote the access , without any discrimination , of people of African descent , Mestizos , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , linguistic and religious groups , minorities , and indigenous peoples , where they exist , to education , medical care and other social services and to eliminate by the year 2010 the disparities these groups experience , inter alia in infant mortality rate , childhood immunization , HIV / AIDS , heart disease , cancer and contagious diseases ;  
The World Conference also requests States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Invites Urges States to promote and support where appropriate the organization and operation of enterprises owned by indigenous people , people of minority descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities by favouring / facilitating equal / promoting equal access to credits and training programmes ;  
Urges States , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to take steps to improve access to public information on health and environmental issues by all people , including those affected by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ; identify and address the adverse effects of government policies and programmes on the human health and environment in targeted areas ; and promote compliance with and enforcement of all health and environmental laws , including in areas inhabited by racial or ethnic minorities , indigenous peoples , or low-income populations ;  
It also urges them to provide the mainstream education with an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the individuals and groups from different cultures and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous people , people of African descent , Roma , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups and minorities have played in building national identifies ; 
Urges States to acknowledge that the centuries-long slave trade , enslavement and other forms of servitude of Africans , people of African descent and indigenous peoples have resulted in substantial and lasting economic , political and cultural damage to these peoples and in the retardation of their institutions and societies , and that justice now requires that to alleviate the inequalities that still persist because of these shameful legacies , substantial national and international efforts be made .  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
In the field of human rights , the ILO has continued to collaborate with other international organizations on issues such as freedom of association , discrimination in employment and occupation , equal opportunities of men and women in employment , indigenous and tribal peoples , migrant workers , forced labour , child labour , and other questions falling within the mandate of ILO .  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Pursuant to the Accord , the Kanaks and the other communities assumed responsibility for their shared destiny on the basis of the rehabilitation of the colonized indigenous Kanak people ; the foundations for wanting to live with one another ( citizenship , identity signs specific to New Caledonia ) ; and a gradual and irreversible power to transfer responsibilities towards full sovereignty .  
The presenter requested the Special Committee to recommend that the 2001 General Assembly resolution call upon the administering Power to realistically re-evaluate its land holding and facilitate the unrestricted return of unused lands to Guam for inclusion in programmes beneficial to original Chamorro landowners ; recognize and sanction the Chamorro Land Trust programme for native Chamorros of Guam ; discontinue immigration policies and practices which impact the demographics of the Territory ; facilitate the legitimate exercise of self-determination by the indigenous Chamorro people of Guam .  
This should include mechanisms for protection when third parties evict a vulnerable group from their bases of subsistence and mechanisms of punishment and compensation in evictions already effected ; the guarantee of security of land tenure and other productive resources ; effective regulation of workers rights ; the guarantee of non-discrimination against women , in the area of work as well as in relation to ownership of property and productive resources ; and the guarantee of traditional rights of indigenous communities in relation to their natural resources ; ( c ) Obligation to fulfil .  
Convinced that human rights education and information is in the best interests of particularly vulnerable segments of society , such as children , youth , women , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with HIV / AIDs and disabled persons ,  
Yet it has been established that some intellectual property rights claimed by multinational corporations are actually derived from indigenous peoples and communities whose know-how and perfect familiarity with various elements of nature and the environment have enabled them over the centuries to accumulate scientific knowledge that is tried and tested but has remained unknown and is consequently not protected by the WTO system .  
Those rights concern historical , cultural and ethnic identity , the juridical identity of indigenous communities , communal possession of traditional lands , bilingual and intercultural education , the preservation of indigenous heritage , measures to promote human development and participation in the management of their natural resources .  6 .  Argentina has established a National Institute against Discrimination , Xenophobia and Racism , a decentralized body within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior .  
The members of these Councils included representatives of teachers , parents , students and government authorities at the municipal , departmental and national levels and , where appropriate , representatives of indigenous organizations , the private sector , universities and other sectors of civil society connected with educational development .  
A Commission for Social and Human Development has been set up and five key elements for the development policy have been defined : to satisfy at least the minimum requirement of Mexicans with respect to food , housing and education ; to apply a measure of equity in all government policies ; to focus on the population living in extreme poverty , particularly indigenous peoples ; to promote social cohesion and community spirit ; and to protect the environment .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
The indigenous knowledge of rural women and their experience in subsistence production and environmental management should be recognized by national and local governments and development experts as a resource , and should be integrated into formal programmes .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
Such projects have included peoples sensitization campaigns on indigenous people issues in Chile ; training sessions for school teachers and representatives of social groups in Chile ; the establishment of a centre in Mexico where human rights violations can be reported and which provides legal assistance to vulnerable groups , such as rural populations , street children , prisoners and people living with HIV / AIDS . France Liberts has also been advocating against the death penalty ; a CD-ROM against racism was also produced and distributed among schools and for public awareness purposes . 
When applicable , this plan should constitute an integral part of the national development plan and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( overall human rights plans or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Secondly , he discussed the Programme for Comprehensive Development of Indigenous Communities which had four main components : the financing of economically productive initiatives aimed at raising the standard of living , health services that combined traditional and occidental medicine , intercultural bilingual education aimed at strengthening ancestral culture and , finally , strengthening of indigenous communities and capacity-building of civil servants working with the indigenous population .  
He argued that indigenous peoples were effectively colonized peoples in the economic , political and historic sense and suffered unfair and unequal economic arrangements typical of other colonized peoples .  
He recognized that certain development activities in the past had had negative impacts on indigenous peoples such as involuntary resettlement , restricted access to natural resources and violations of basic human rights .  
The representative called for an investigation into the mining activities of the Peabody Western Coal Company , which had damaged the health of indigenous peoples , destroyed irreplaceable religious shrines , ancestral graves / burial sites and other sacred areas , caused the decline of the aquifers and contaminated natural springs and vegetation ; the mining had also caused forced relocation . 
He further requested that the Working Group pay attention to and report on the emerging standards based on precedent and existing legal instruments by which indigenous peoples and nations were seeking justice and reparations for the past and present abuses of mining and other corporations , including in the home countries of transnational corporations .  
At its 25th meeting , on 15 August 2001 , the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , having considered the final working paper submitted by the Special Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene A . Daes , on indigenous peoples and their relationship to land ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 2001 / 21 ) , having heard the significant and constructive statement by the Special Rapporteur and expressing deepest appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent , valuable final working paper , decided :  
Emphasize that there are principal victims of the violations of economic , social and cultural rights , in particular indigenous peoples , migrants , persons of African origin , the unemployed , uneducated children , women , older persons , persons with a disability and other persons in situations subject to more severe discrimination , and call on States to adopt specific action to meet their needs ;  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , the needs of local indigenous communities , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established . 
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , the needs of local indigenous communities , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
As previously recorded , there are no indications of Iraq having retained any physical capability for the indigenous production of weapon-usable nuclear material in amounts of any practical significance , nor any indication Iraq has acquired or produced weapon-usable nuclear material other than the nuclear material verified by IAEA and removed from Iraq in accordance with paragraph 13 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .  
To establish the increasingly necessary restrictions on the activities of certain non-State sectors currently acting as they please within the international framework , with a view to making them meet the national and international standards ensuring the protection of the basic rights , including human rights , of the most vulnerable sectors , in particular local workers , indigenous peoples , national or ethnic minorities and migrant workers ;  
Develop and utilize indigenous energy sources and infrastructures for various local uses and promote rural community participation , including local Agenda 21 groups , with the support of the international community , in developing and utilizing renewable energy technologies to meet their daily energy needs to find simple and local solutions ;  
Eight members to be appointed by the President of the Council following formal consultations with the Bureau and regional groups through their coordinators , on the basis of broad consultations with indigenous organizations , taking into account the diversity and geographical distribution of the indigenous people of the world as well as the principles of transparency , representativity and equal opportunity for all indigenous people , including internal processes , when appropriate , and local indigenous consultation processes .  
To adopt or continue to apply , in agreement with them , constitutional , administrative , legislative , judicial and all necessary measures to promote , protect and ensure the enjoyment by indigenous peoples of their rights , as well as to guarantee them the exercise of their human rights and fundamental freedoms on the basis of equality , non-discrimination and full and free participation in all areas of society , in particular in matters affecting or concerning their interests ;  
The improvement of the access to international markets of products from countries affected by the phenomena of slavery , servitude and colonization , including the development and implementation of special and differential treatment in respect of the length of the adjustment periods in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that would establish a more equitable and supportive international trade environment for States that are populated substantially by people of African descent and indigenous peoples ;  
The creation and implementation of a programme to restore to the country of origin the many invaluable art objects , historical artifacts and documents that have been unjustly removed from Africa and the Americas and from peoples of African descent and indigenous peoples over the centuries , and the provision of financial and technical assistance to equip the relevant States with museums and related facilities that will be required to properly conserve and store these articles ;  
Include in their regular reporting to their boards of governors information on their contributions to promoting the participation of people of African descent , indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups within their organizations , and information on their efforts to facilitate the participation of racial , ethnic , religious , cultural and other minorities in the economic , social , political and cultural life of their countries ;  
Governments and indigenous peoples that are prepared to address these problems deserve a significantly greater level of financial and technical assistance from operational bodies and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , as well as other relevant international institutions and intergovernmental organizations .  
To ensure that institutions responsible for providing statistical information on the population take explicit account of the existence of [ indigenous peoples , people of varying descent and other ethnic groups , ] capturing the component parts of their diversity according to their needs and obtain data on relevant and appropriate characteristics , designing strategies to evaluate the human rights all policies concerning ethnic groups .  
Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
" By bringing together companies from other economies , researchers in our tertiary institutions and local enterprises with scientific and technological competence , the science park will provide a major impetus for the development of indigenous science and technology-based companies in Hong Kong , " he said , adding that it would also promote technology transfer by attracting overseas investment and enhance regional co-operation in this area .  
To implement the aforesaid principles , a " lawful successor " is defined in the Ordinance to mean " a person , male or female , who on the death of an indigenous villager is or becomes entitled to an interest in the estate of the deceased by lawful succession and which person is a descendant through the male line of the deceased " .  
Local DSC playing Chinese music in western rock style , has given them the most indigenous face of all rock bands in Hong Kong . They also interpret traditional ethnic music with varying musical elements , which has earned them numerous awards on the way .  
( a ) whether the authorities have , over the past three financial years , objected to applications from these owners to the Town Planning Board for land development or change in land use for development or rejected applications from indigenous residents of the New Territories for building small houses on private land , on the ground that the land concerned is reserved for infrastructure or housing projects ; if so , of the details of the relevant policies in this regard and the respective numbers of applications objected to or rejected over the above period ; and  
In exporting ducks and their down , the most intractable problems are associated with color and quarantine regulations in foreign countries . Taiwan 's indigenous ducks are usually black or brown , and the feathers leave black roots after the bird is plucked , which are unattractive to customers .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "  
The image of the lion is widely seen in art both East and West , but in East Asia , where the animal is not indigenous , the conclusion is obvious that its image must have come from West , possibly as long ago as the time of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia . The creation of the artistic lion of East Asia from the real lion , that is to say , represents a kind of cultural interchange .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
The pestle music of the Bunun , which is played before the rice harvest , was originally intended to attract people from neighboring villages to come and share in the crop . Rice is n't planted much any more , but the performance still shows the tribe 's solidarity and generous spirit of sharing , qualities worth cherishing by indigenous people and outsiders alike .  
Realism easy - - art from life hard : Today native culture is increasingly receiving more attention , and people are concerned about indigenous bird species . In science , great emphasis is placed on exact breeds and species , and painters strive to portray Mikado pheasants or other precise species of birds . What must be aspired to in painting birds , apart from aesthetic enjoyment , must still be to let spectators understand birds at a glance . The challenge for artists is very great . "  
Except for a thin stretch of western Taiwan 's coastline settled by Chuanchow and Changchow Fukienese and a few Pingpu indigenous peoples , Shen was welcomed only by deep , forbidding mountains . The Han Chinese living on the coast called these " Fanshan , " or " savage mountains . "  
With the December sun shining as if it were the first day of spring back in the interior , he decided to change the name of the place where he settled - - previously called Lang-chiao in the Paiwan language - - to " Hengchun , " meaning " eternal spring . " He went on to open up the mountains and subdue the indigenous people , taking the peninsula from the era of being an aboriginal stronghold to the " Hengchun " era .  
Now that attacking had become more of a challenge , the indigenous people organized 18 settlements together for a joint assault . The residents , fearing the aborigines would set the city wan alight , stacked up tens of oxcarts to build another wall outside the original one , and , after a fierce battle , finally pushed the attackers back into the hills .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
The disadvantaged of the disadvantagedAustralia 's public television has a regular program displaying government-sponsored documentaries which are filmed by their indigenous peoples . In the United States , many reservations have community programs produced and hosted by native Americans . But Taiwan 's public television news department is recruiting reporters whose aboriginal identity is a prerequisite . This is a rarity not only in Taiwan ; throughout the whole world it would be hard to find a comparable experience .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process . It would be absolutely wrong to accuse the organizing committee of paying attention only to " blood " when they were recruiting indigenous journalists . Even more vital criteria were the extent of concern and understanding the trainees demonstrated toward indigenous affairs , the amount of experience they had in the settlements , and whether they were fluent in their traditional languages . "  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
There is greater flexibility in the forward progress of the experimental classes . Teachers can design instructional activities to meet the needs of the curriculum . For example , in the Chinese language class on " Kung Jung Takes the Smallest Pear , " the teacher got the kids to put on a little drama . For a third year lesson in the standardized texts on the aboriginal " Harvest Festival , " the Tatun Primary School invited the Formosan Aboriginal Dance Troupe to perform traditional indigenous song and dance at the school .  
In regard to this problem , Paolaban believes that each indigenous group has its own distinct naming method ; recovering the names is not the action of individuals , but should be based on information from a detailed survey . From common discussions among the nine groups and linguistic scholars , a single universal system should be derived .  
Given the recent favor bestowed in Taiwan on things " native , " the music and dance of Taiwan 's aboriginal peoples have been staged as an art form , and groups of indigenous people have formed aboriginal dance troupes . Using anthropological methodology , they have studied and recorded the disappearing songs and steps of every indigenous community .  
An even more noteworthy feature of their culture is that they typically buried the dead sideways with knees bent , and the burial site was not far from their homes , meaning that even when Ketagalans passed away , they were not forsaken by their relatives or society . They still received attention and remained in their loved ones ' memory . This is somewhat similar to what we know from oral history of the funerary customs of other indigenous people .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
According to the field interviews of cultural writer Ma Teng-yueh , who has traveled extensively writing down the experiences of tattooed tribal elders , the Saisiyat live quite close to the Atayal , and the reason they started tattooing their faces is " the inevitable result of protecting themselves against a stronger enemy . " Therefore , in actuality , among all the indigenous peoples , only Atayal have the inherent custom of facial tattooing . That is why the Qing Dynasty documents usually referred to Atayal as " qingmian fan " ( " tattoo-faced barbarians " ) .  
Along with the evolution of time , the untoward condition of indigenous society has made many of these " facial tattoo treasures " lose the shelter of their younger relatives , due to alcoholism and other problems . Among the medical records of the tattooed old folks of Tai-an Rural Township , quite a few have an impoverished family and live long-term in unhygienic environments . A couple even live alone . Although most of them are taken care of by their relatives , chronic diseases of old age constitute a heavy burden on their children .  
Over the last few years , Taiwan 's con-servation movement has risen to the level where there is discussion and debate on the merits of animal welfare . The people of Taiwan have been scolded for consuming wild animals , and the hunters among the indigenous tribes on the island , who are the direct source of these animals , have been labeled " wildlife terminators . "  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Maxwell practiced his brand of medical missionary work in Taiwan for six-and-a-half years , travelling throughout central and southern Formosa , and he founded three Presbyterian parishes . One was in the southernmost area , inhabited by the Sir-aya indigenous people ( around today 's Mucha and Tsochen ) , a second in the south-central region of Taiwan ( Paiho , Chiaya ) , and a third in north-central Taiwan , home to the Pazeh people ( today 's Puli , Fengyuan , and Shenkang ) .  
Besides medical work , another major contribution of Maxwell 's missionary work was the translation of a vernacular Bible . Since Pingpu indigenous people were the main focus of his missionary work , Maxwell traveled frequently to Aboriginal parishes . There he discovered that contracts for buying and selling of land between Pingpu people and Han Chinese were written using the romanized writing system that was a legacy of the Dutch occupation .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
Before the 1980s , academic work on aborigines was largely confined to anthropology . Research focused on things like the clothing , social structure , and myths and legends of the various tribes . Aboriginal culture was treated as something already dead , as a museum specimen . This type of research was of no help at all in understanding how living indigenous people were responding to changing times .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
The 2003 Asia-Pacific Arts Forum marked another step in cooperation between the Council for Cultural Affairs ( CCA ) and NTUA , following on the 2000 Asia-Pacific Traditional Arts Forum . The Arts Forum , specially coordinated with the CCA 's 2003 " Creative Culture Industry Year , " devoted special attention to culture not only as an end in itself but also as an economic activity . It aimed to encourage discussion about the common problems facing the development of indigenous cultures and cultural industries in the Asia-Pacific region .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous persons and ethnic minorities .  
Special attention may need to be directed towards groups such as women , children , the elderly , the poor , migrant workers , persons with dual or multiple disabilities , indigenous people and ethnic minorities .  
Major groups , such as women , the private sector , indigenous peoples , and others represented through a wide array of nongovernmental organizations , are critical to ensuring broad public participation in sustainable development .  
The meeting urged subregional and regional banking / financial institutions to channel the greater part of their resources towards the private sector , creating indigenous capital markets , rather than depend on the existing ones controlled by foreign interests .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
The raising of awareness about indigenous peoples must be seen not as the task of a Year but as part of the ongoing and permanent process of education and public information about human rights and the urgent need to protect and strengthen cultural diversity .  
The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights of national minorities and indigenous peoples and has established a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea . But for Ukraine , which faces conditions of economic crisis and a complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary infrastructure , services and mechanisms , the task of accommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated persons appears too complicated .  
To attain the objectives of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , Ecuador , a multi-ethnic country , has submitted various concrete programmes and initiatives , in consultation with national indigenous organizations , designed to improve the economic , social and cultural status of those groups while fully respecting their distinctive characteristics .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
The objective is to provide for the land requirements of human settlement development through environmentally sound physical planning and land use so as to ensure access to land to all households and , where appropriate , the encouragement of communally and collectively owned and managed land .  6 / Particular attention should be paid to the needs of women and indigenous people for economic and cultural reasons .  
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Governments , with the participation of the private sector , non-governmental organizations , local community groups , indigenous people , women , local government units and the public at large , should act to maintain and expand the existing vegetative cover wherever ecologically , socially and economically feasible , through technical cooperation and other forms of support .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
The World Conference recognized the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society and strongly reaffirms the commitment of the international community to their economic , social and cultural well-being and their enjoyment of the fruits of sustainable development .  
Members asked for concrete examples of temporary special measures , and whether any such measures were foreseen to correct the high illiteracy rate , the low employment rate of women and the low rate of participation of women in political decision-making or to protect indigenous and rural women .  
In reply to a question about concrete steps the Government had taken to raise the living standards of indigenous women , the representative said that the Government had primarily directed its efforts to supporting the basic needs of rural women .  
Protecting the [ traditional ] rights to land and other resources of pastoralists , fishery workers and nomadic and indigenous people and strengthening land management in areas of pastoral or nomadic activity , building on traditional communal practices , controlling encroachment by others , and developing improved systems of range management and access to water , markets , credit , animal production , veterinary services , health including health services , education and information ;  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
The devastating effects of short-fallow shifting cultivation are often not the work of mountain people , but of landless lowland farmers moving farther up into mountain areas as squatters in search of " unoccupied " land and applying lowland production techniques unsuited to complex upland realms .  42 .  Sustainable mountain development in many places has to start with a change in attitude towards indigenous people and in the way they are treated .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Recommends for this purpose that a second technical meeting on the planning of the Decade be convened immediately prior to the thirteenth session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations , to be supported from within existing budgetary resources , and urges Governments , United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and , in particular , indigenous people 's organizations to participate actively in that meeting , in accordance with agreed procedures ;  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
Women , particularly indigenous women , have pivotal roles in environmental conservation , owing to their combined roles and responsibilities in the family and the community , their knowledge of ecological links and fragile ecosystem management and their concern for the quality and sustainability of life for present and future generations .  
As part of its primary responsibility for public information activities built around the World Public Information Campaign for Human Rights and the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in 1993 , the Department reprinted and distributed essential publications on human rights , including backgrounders on human rights and culture and on indigenous people .  
All parties involved in the development process , including academic institutions , non-governmental organizations and grass-roots and women 's groups , should mobilize to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes directed towards the poorest and most disadvantaged groups of women , such as rural and indigenous women , female heads of households , young women and older women , refugees and migrant women and women with disabilities .  
Concerning the proposals for action , the Working Group suggested that the Commission consider encouraging countries , with the support of the international community , to prepare and initiate implementation of comprehensive national mountain development programmes and to strengthen national capacity for sustainable mountain development using a participatory approach involving all stakeholders , including local and indigenous communities and non-governmental organizations .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Structure services to reach rural and urban women involved in small , micro and medium-scale enterprises , with special attention to young , low-income , ethnic and racial minority , and indigenous women who lack access to capital and assets ;  
Recognition of the identity of the indigenous peoples is fundamental to the construction of a national unity based on respect for and the exercise of political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans .  
Incorporate the educational concepts of the Maya and other indigenous peoples , particularly in the philosophical , scientific , artistic , pedagogical , historical , linguistic and socio-political areas , as part of the overall reform of the educational system ;  
Regulate and support a system of informational , scientific , artistic and educational programmes on indigenous cultures in their languages , through the national radio , television and the written media .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
They are , inter alia , rights to equality of treatment and non-discrimination ; such cultural rights as the right to use indigenous languages , to use indigenous dress and to practise indigenous forms of spirituality ; such civil and political rights as the rights to practise traditional indigenous forms of social organization ; and such economic and social rights as the right to hold land under traditional forms of tenure .  
In the Agreement , the Government has committed itself to the effective protection of indigenous rights by promoting the creation of legal offices for the defence of those rights and the establishment of " popular law offices " to provide free legal assistance to persons of limited economic means in municipalities in which indigenous communities are prevalent .  
APINESS was set up in 1986 with a view to providing national-level academic groups in the social sciences field appropriate , relevant and pertinent international as well as indigenous data , documentation and information , so that professionals in the field of social sciences may meaningfully contribute to national development .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
The origin of social exclusion is often to be found in racism and racial discrimination , phenomena which many Governments believe should be written off as things of the past , denying their persistence or describing as " natural " the economic and social conditions of ethnic , racial and religious minorities and indigenous populations .  
Finally , how to intervene most effectively has to be judged - through economic policy instruments , legal reform , law enforcement , intergovernmental cooperation , political , administrative or judicial discretion , education policies , research and development policies , technology development and dissemination , or empowerment of particular geographical or disadvantaged social groups , such as indigenous people , minorities and women .  
In particular , the main purposes of the Decade were lost among initiatives of limited scope or proposals to establish direct communication links between the United Nations system and indigenous communities , without due regard to the legitimate role of national Governments as the appropriate channel for international cooperation .  
NULLLegally recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms and the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
This handbook reflects the unique nature of the commitments made in the Agreement , which focus on the constitutional , legal and administrative reforms considered necessary for the elimination of discrimination , both de facto and de jure , and for the effective exercise of the specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
NULLThe process of investigating individual cases takes into account the rights of indigenous peoples as set forth in the Guatemalan Constitution and in international human rights instruments to which Guatemala is a party , particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , and therefore emphasizes discrimination with respect to cultural , civil and political rights .  
In 1991 , the Bank issued a revised policy ( Operational Directive 4.20 ) , which extends the definition of indigenous peoples to include a much wider array of groups who maintain social and cultural identities distinct from those of the national societies in which they live , who have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and who are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .  
The Working Group considers that participation should be extended to indigenous peoples and to ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , youth and children and that the elderly should also be considered as active agents in all the processes of formulation , implementation and monitoring of development programmes .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws to improve their legal status and guarantee their territorial , economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , the Prime Minister of Fiji had stressed the importance of working to redress some of the wrongs that history had wrought upon indigenous peoples and guaranteeing that external values and forces did not continue to impose political concessions , economic reforms and social changes that were not desired by indigenous people themselves .  
With regard to the programme of activities for the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People , ILO had adopted the only international legal instrument addressing the question of the living and working conditions of indigenous and tribal peoples , the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 , which recognized that such peoples had a unique cultural identity , and stressed the need to involve them in the making of decisions that would affect their future .

a decision adopted on 28 April 1995 , the High Council of the Republic , the transitional parliament , bearing in mind all the adverse consequences for the Zairians which resulted from the presence of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi , including ecological problems , criminal acts and attempts to dominate the indigenous inhabitants , had decided to demand the unconditional return , without delay , of all refugees and immigrants from those countries .  
was unacceptable that many were unable to enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms , and it was essential that the international community should be aware of that , in order to make every effort to secure the enjoyment of those rights for indigenous people .  
Solutions to the problems faced by indigenous people must be worked out with their full participation and on the basis of full respect for their human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and identity .  
The standards on indigenous rights to be elaborated by the Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights should promote peaceful and constructive solutions based on the principles of multicultural societies , inter-ethnic understanding and harmony and tolerance .  Respect for the rights of indigenous people did not prejudice the territorial integrity of States , but strengthened it and prevented violent conflicts .  
the past year , there had been increasing reports of slavery and forced labour of women and children belonging to racial , ethnic and religious minorities ; of atrocities against indigenous peoples ; of indiscriminate aerial bombardments against civilian targets , and of unaccompanied minors being conscripted into military service .  
They made a commitment , among other things , to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to strengthen laws , policies and programmes to secure the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of political , civil , economic , social and cultural life ; to promote and protect the rights of the child ; to ensure protection of the rights of people who are particularly vulnerable , including young people , the disabled , the elderly and migrant workers ; and to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations .  
The desire to ensure effective democratization in national life and to foster development is at the core of the activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out to benefit children , young people , women , indigenous and rural populations , the disabled and certain particularly disadvantaged urban groups .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
The most obvious case of grave violations of human rights in an industrialized country , however , was that of the United States , where the " American dream " was a tragic nightmare for vast sectors of its population in a society that was unable to conceal the situation of extreme inequality and open discrimination that affected tens of millions of African Americans , Latin Americans , Asians and indigenous people .  
The High Commissioner has raised issues relating to economic , social and cultural rights , as well as the right to development , promotion of the rights of women , the status of minorities , indigenous people , the status of non-citizens , the legal status of refugees and asylum-seekers , protection of the rights of children and conformity of national legislation with international standards .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
[ Depending on local conditions in the housing sector and the availability of legal protection guaranteeing equal access to resources and opportunities , ] vulnerable groups include the poorest groups , some of the older persons , street children , youth , [ documented ] migrants , internally displaced persons , inhabitants of disadvantaged communities , people affected by natural and human-caused disasters , households headed by women , persons with disabilities and some indigenous people .  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Recognize the existence , identity and rights of indigenous people through constitutional reforms or the adoption of new laws , when appropriate , to improve their legal status and guarantee their economic , social , cultural , political and civil rights .  
The active involvement of a wide variety of major groups , including national and international non-governmental organizations , the media , corporations and firms in the private sector , the scientific community , educational organizations and indigenous communities , is now sought on a more consistent basis .  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
Cooperation and assistance can take a variety of forms , including joint ventures with local entrepreneurs in mining and the provision of ancillary supplies and services ; initiating complementary work and marketing relationships with indigenous small-scale producers ; lending expertise to both the Government and producers ; voluntarily returning marginal or small deposits to the national mineral inventory ; and joint or sole sponsoring of demonstration projects , training programmes or mining schools .  
Progress in the peace process and in the political transition , the growing participation of indigenous communities in national life , and the higher awareness at the highest level of government and in civil society that impunity must be fought are a source of renewed hope for a better future .  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
To strengthen the institutional capacity of Governments and communities for the development , utilization and commercialization of new and renewable energy sources ; to develop national and indigenous capacity in assessment and management of energy resources and services ; to introduce changes in energy consumption patterns , focusing on conservation measures and demand-side management ; to facilitate international and interregional connections for the transmission of electric power and transport of natural gas ; and to promote technology transfer to different levels of government , civil society , community institutions and entrepreneurs .  
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
The system is based on the criterion of rationalizing the use of State penal power by offering such options as : ( a ) punishing crime that has a high social cost and reducing the severity of punishment for less serious crimes ; ( b ) avoiding discrimination against the more vulnerable sectors , such as women and indigenous people ; ( c ) scrupulously respecting constitutional guarantees such as the principles of legality and guilt ; and ( d ) guaranteeing the rational and egalitarian implementation of the law .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
In accordance with the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space concerning the development of indigenous capabilities , General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in which the Assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that the United Nations should lead , with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations , an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology in existing national / regional educational institutions in the developing countries , and resolution 50 / 27  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Realizing the increasingly important role of indigenous people and youth in solving the major problems facing humankind and the need to provide them with broader opportunities to play an active part in all aspects of the social , economic , political , cultural , spiritual and moral life of their peoples , as partners in development ,  
Their traditional knowledge as regards the identification and use of medicinal plants , animals and minerals must be protected , and where this knowledge is commercialized and applied for profit without their consent , Governments concerned must consult the indigenous people from whom such knowledge has been taken , on whether they want to be compensated and if they so desire , the Governments concerned shall assist them in securing due compensation .  
We agree to support ongoing and new creative partnerships , recognizing that indigenous people , youth and other disadvantaged and vulnerable groups possess in common the potential for diverse realization of full human development .  
In the spirit of cooperative linkages for joint exploration of human potentials , we agree to focus on partnership actions that clarify , interpret , create , protect and promote socio-legal , political , economic , educational , cultural , moral and spiritual processes affecting the abilities of indigenous people and youth to choose , maintain , access , encourage , manage and actualize their diverse ways of achieving just and humane growth and development .  
For the moment , he has observed that since its colonization , Colombia has experienced persistent racial discrimination : the indigenous population and Black people have been marginalized , and live in deplorable economic and social conditions - they are the poorest groups .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
That concern arose from their commitment to decolonization and the rights of the indigenous Kanaks , including the preservation and promotion of their social and cultural values , which had been reflected in the South Pacific Forum vision statement and the " Melanesia beyond 2000 " strategy which declared that the four Member States and the Front de lib �� ation nationale Kanake socialiste ( FLNKS ) were determined to support the orderly decolonization of New Caledonia with special safeguards for the indigenous Kanaks .  
Expert seminars have been held on the effects of racism and racial discrimination on the social and economic relations between indigenous peoples and States ( Geneva , 1989 ) , on schemes of internal self-government for indigenous peoples ( Nuuk , 1991 ) , on practical experience in the realization of sustainable and environmentally sound self-development of indigenous peoples ( Santiago , 1992 ) , and on practical experiences regarding indigenous land rights and claims ( Whitehorse , 1996 ) .  
In 1991 , the World Bank issued a revised policy which extends its own definition of indigenous people to include a much wider array of groups that maintain cultural and social identities distinct from those of the national societies where they live , have close attachments to their ancestral lands , and are susceptible to being disadvantaged in the development process .  
UNESCO 's efforts through programme implementation are centred on the training of human resources in fields of vital importance for their development , such as access to mother-tongue education , revitalization of components of their cultural heritage , development of traditional skills relating to the protection and use of natural resources , promotion of crafts and encouraging systematic mechanisms of dialogue with member States . UNESCO 's policy in the area of indigenous issues is a long-term task based on regular and progressive consultation with indigenous partners .  
The project consisted of an inter-agency mission by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , FAO , UNIDO , and UNESCO to provide an integrated package of policy advice to the Government on : ( i ) integrating environment and development at all levels of the decision-making process ; ( ii ) an integrated approach to the management of renewable and non-renewable natural resources ; ( iii ) strengthening mechanisms for effective indigenous people 's participation in decision-making ; ( iv ) capacity-building for villages , communities , and grass-root non-governmental organizations .  
The survey produced written and oral responses from individuals and delegations covering well over half of the total 232 indigenous participants at the Working Group session , reflecting their geographical diversity and a broad range of experience of the United Nations system .  
In his message , the Secretary-General pointed out that the International Decade promotes concrete action in such vital areas as human rights , protection of the environment and access to health and education - areas in which indigenous people must be actively involved ; and also referred to the efforts the United Nations system can make to enhance international cooperation and understanding on issues of central concern to the world 's indigenous people .  
Such conferences include the World Summit for Social Development , 10 / held in Copenhagen in March 1995 , which stated that it recognized and supported indigenous people in their pursuit of economic and social development , with full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural values .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
It was mentioned that the Centre was also committed to protecting and maintaining the historic , cultural and natural heritage of indigenous and other people , and that Governments , as enabling partners , should create and strengthen effective partnerships with vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities .  
It is possible without unnecessary infringement of sovereign prerogatives of States to encourage indigenous non-governmental organizations , supported when necessary by independent and impartial international non-governmental organizations , to initiate timely action .  
Tied to this factor , the modern domestic private sector is still embryonic and indigenous entrepreneurial capacity is scarce , lacking capital and managerial expertise and experience .  
The nationalistic policies , economic interests and electoral considerations that were inherent in political parties , interest groups and Governments fostered attitudes of rejection and intolerance of migrant workers , refugees , asylum-seekers , minorities and indigenous populations .  Very often , the media and new technologies , such as electronic mail and the Internet , facilitated the large-scale dissemination of racist , xenophobic and neofascist practices .  
The proclamation of the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People reflected the commitment of the international community to promoting and protecting the human rights of indigenous people , especially their economic , social and cultural well-being .  
The recent Administrative Decentralization Act provided a mechanism for indigenous and peasant communities to make their needs known to the central Government through local governments ; other legal measures had brought indigenous people into the national social security system and formalized their territorial rights .  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
He hoped that the Decade 's programme of activities would be implemented fully and that problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health would be solved effectively through efforts at the national level and greater international cooperation .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Please provide information on the measures adopted , including at the legislative , administrative , educational , budgetary and social levels , to ensure that a child belonging to an ethnic , religious or linguistic minority or who is indigenous is not denied the right , in community with other members of his or her group :  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The main victims of this trend are racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities , migrant workers , foreigners and indigenous populations .  
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
National level criteria and indicators should be formulated through a transparent process involving all [ relevant ] [ interested ] parties , including forest owners , [ native forest dwellers and NGOs ] [ forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities , as well as major groups , where applicable ] .  
A wide programme of eradication of coca plants , poppies and marijuana crops continued to be carried out , and continued efforts were being made to obtain additional resources through international cooperation to complement those already invested in the country 's alternative development programme , which constituted an economically sustainable solution for peasant and indigenous families , and a long-term solution for elimination of the illicit supply of drugs .  
Mechanisms should continue to be developed within the United Nations to give the nominated representatives of indigenous organizations and peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice and take part in decision-making in the search for solutions to the problems faced by their peoples .  At its fifty _ second session , the Commission , by decision 1996 / 102 , established an agenda item entitled Indigenous issues .  
As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Whereas , at the national level , recognition of the identity of indigenous peoples is of fundamental importance for building national unity based on respect for and the exercise of the political , cultural , economic and spiritual rights of all Guatemalans , as well as on the fulfilment of their duties ,  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
The main objective of chapter 26 is to establish full partnerships between Governments , international organizations and indigenous people . 14 Proposals to achieve the main objective include establishing processes that empower indigenous people ; strengthening the active participation of indigenous people in the formulation of national policies related to resource management ; and involving indigenous people at the national and local levels in programmes related to sustainable development .  
The latter includes establishing appropriate national policies and legal instruments ; protection of indigenous lands from environmentally unsound activities ; recognition of indigenous values , knowledge and resource management practices ; development of national dispute settlement arrangements ; and enhancement of capacity-building for indigenous communities .  Key : forward ; backward ; unchanged ; ? unclear .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
The many initiatives which had subsequently led to the drafting of new instruments were considered by delegations as particularly valuable , as was the exploration of especially critical problems encountered in the modern world , including attention to issues in the field of social and economic rights , such as the right to housing , extreme poverty and indigenous rights . 
Furthermore , they have established programmes to develop the principles of the CBD and facilitate their implementation : on coastal and marine biodiversity ; forest biodiversity ; agricultural biodiversity ; the biodiversity of inland waters ; the rights of indigenous and local communities under the CBD ; and the equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity .  
While recognizing the efforts undertaken by the authorities in the education system , the Committee is concerned about the persisting disparities in relation to the low access to education of children living in rural areas , indigenous children and refugee children , who do not enjoy a system of education adequate to their cultural values and identity .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination that the indigenous populations in Guatemala suffered and are suffering , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , with a view to enabling the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
In her statement , the Chairperson-Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene Daes , outlined four major concerns : ( a ) the need for a recognition of the effects of dispossession of lands and habitat on the health of indigenous peoples ; ( b ) the exposure of indigenous peoples to hazardous industrial and military activities ; ( c ) the need to improve access to national health-care systems ; ( d ) the role traditional medical practices could play in national primary health-care systems and the protection of those practices .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance of lands , territories and resources to the continued survival and vitality of indigenous societies .  
Recognizing the respect for the environment accorded by the cultures of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and considering the special relationship between the indigenous peoples and the environment , lands , resources and territories on which they live and their natural resources .  Recognizing that in many indigenous cultures , traditional collective systems for control and use of land and territory and resources , including bodies of water and coastal areas , are a necessary condition for their survival , social organization , development and their individual and collective well-being . . .  
In summary , each of these examples underscores a number of elements that are unique to indigenous peoples : ( 1 ) a profound relationship between indigenous peoples and their lands , territories and resources exists ; ( 2 ) that this relationship has various social , cultural , spiritual , economic and political dimensions and responsibilities ; ( 3 ) that the collective dimension of this relationship is significant ; and ( 4 ) that the inter-generational aspect of such a relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples identity , survival and cultural viability .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , as well as others , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 15 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system . 
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a more fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
Other practices are the use of indigenous objects like the buho or bamboo in cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn baby instead of unnatural objects , like scissors , the use of which , it is believed , will influence the child to be disloyal to the family and the hanging of dried umbilical cord pusod of a newborn baby beneath the doorway or window in the belief that this will keep the infant safe from accident or harm .  
He agreed that there should not be a single legal definition of indigenous peoples at the international level at this time , although a definition might be required at the national level .  
An indigenous participant from South America reported on some activities carried on in the field of indigenous rights and human rights : seminars and workshops had been organized and a number of publications had been distributed with a view to improving understanding of international legal instruments regarding indigenous peoples and monitoring their implementation .  
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .  The guidelines included several aspects : prior informed consent and consultation with indigenous peoples ;  
Two representatives from North and South America respectively complained about the role of the United Nations which was considered to be too weak ; one of them lamented the paternalistic approach of the United Nations towards indigenous issues ; the other stressed the need for the United Nations to take a more active role along with its speciliazed agencies , in particular as far as the voluntary funds were concerned .  
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
International Corporations should negotiate with the indigenous communities a just and fair profit _ sharing arrangement , prior to signing of any kind of agreement , and with full disclosure of the projected profit and complete development plans for the relevant project , to ensure that the peoples concerned receive an equitable profit share and / or compensation package .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Deeply concerned that understanding of human nature has been significantly modified by the rapid rise of developments in biotechnology as a science , particularly in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes , and that indigenous people are most vulnerable to the risk of being singled out for human genetic research and human gene patenting by the biotechnology industry ,  
Takes note of the work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization in the field of the human genome to complete the preliminary draft of a universal declaration on the human genome and human rights , a standard _ setting framework urgently needed to ensure that such research and its applications are developed in a harmonious way that demonstrates regard for human dignity , in particular for the dignity and way of life of indigenous peoples ;  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
That Constitution included clear provisions concerning collective land ownership , the management of natural resources , recognition of indigenous forms of government and administration , protection of the identity and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples , the official status of the languages and dialects they used and the creation of special electoral districts ensuring their representation in Congress .  
In that connection , an expert group headed by the Minister of Justice and composed of representatives of governmental agencies , non-governmental and indigenous organizations and scientists and academics had been set up to elaborate a national policy with regard to indigenous people and to contribute to the lawmaking process in that new area of national legislation .  
His Government had worked tirelessly to set aside almost 1-million square kilometres - more than a tenth of the national territory - for the 330,000 indigenous people living in Brazil , a process that had required the adoption of special legislation to ensure its constitutionality . 
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 163 of 21 December 1993 in which it proclaimed the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People ( 1995-2004 ) , stated that the Decade 's main objective was to strengthen international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
This workshop on indigenous and black women ended on 14 July 1996 with a call for equitable participation in all organizational structures and the appointment of women to top _ level and decision _ making posts in the political , economic and cultural spheres .  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Regretting the human rights violations , both individual and collective , the marginalization and discrimination suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala , together with the continued deterioration of the economic and social situation , with its serious consequences for the great majority of the population , particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society ,  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
Conscious that , in various situations , indigenous people are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms , determined to do everything possible to promote the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people , and bearing in mind that international standards must be developed on the basis of the diverse situations and aspirations of the world 's indigenous people , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
In paragraph 17 of his statement , the Secretary-General proposes to head the five verification areas ( human rights ; indigenous affairs ; social , economic and agrarian aspects ; strengthening of civilian power ; and resettlement and integration ) at the D-1 level instead of the current P-5 level .  
Cuba 's bilateral relationship with Canada had enabled the Cuban delegation to communicate to that countrys representatives the point of view of vast sectors of civil society in Cuba regarding the exercise of human rights by the indigenous population of Canada , particularly their economic , social and cultural rights , in respect of which much progress needed to be made .  
Many governmental representatives also stated that it is not necessary to arrive at a universal definition of indigenous peoples in the context of the draft United Nations declaration , although some Governments recognized the concerns of countries with complex ethnic and historical circumstances .  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
Specific objectives are : food security through increased agricultural production , and improvement of nutritional levels and incomes of the poorest rural populations , the landless , marginal farmers , pastoralists , artisanal fishermen , and indigenous peoples ; and , cutting across all categories , poor rural women .  
We uphold the traditional indigenous perspective that the mental , physical , social and spiritual well-being of our peoples and the survival of our future generations can not be separated from the health of our environment , the practice of our cultures and religions and the expression of our inherent right to self-determination .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
History has shown that the huge present-day inequalities between developed and poor countries are the result of centuries of plundering and exploitation during which civilizations , social structures and indigenous modes of production were destroyed and during which the ecosystems of Africa , America and Asia were pillaged .  
Measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Gender discrimination was often practised against specific social groups , such as migrant workers , especially undocumented " illegal " workers coming from " poor " countries , including indigenous women .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
Acknowledging that indigenous peoples in many countries have been deprived of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and that many of the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples are linked to the historical and continuing deprivation of ancestral rights over lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing that United Nations organs and Member States have increasingly acknowledged that lands and natural resources are essential to the Economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples , and that some States have enacted legal measures that uphold indigenous land rights or have established procedures for arriving at legally binding agreements on indigenous land _ related issues ,  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
The permanent forum for indigenous peoples could not only foster national _ level development partnerships in areas such as medicine , agriculture and conservation , but also international partnerships that will have a regional or worldwide economic impact .  
The need to set indigenous language literacy teaching within a well _ defined legal , administrative , financial and technical framework would appear to be self _ evident .  
While the latter issue affects any participating individual and community , indigenous populations arguably have minimal access to the legal advice and political power necessary to secure an outcome satisfactory to them .  
The representative stated that women living in rural areas , particularly those belonging to indigenous groups , remained marginalized and had higher rates of maternal mortality , adolescent pregnancy and illiteracy than women living in Perus urban centres .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
While his delegation appreciated the contributions of States to voluntary funds and fellowships for indigenous populations , the overall amounts involved were wholly inadequate for the realization of their social , economic and political development needs . 
The right to an adequate standard of living is recognized in Australia , and supported by a system of social welfare which protects the most disadvantaged in society _ the unemployed , the sick , the elderly , indigenous peoples and people with disabilities .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous people have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous people to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Another indigenous representative from Oceania recognized that , despite difficulties , some progress had been made in indigenous health conditions and that traditional cultural , social and spiritual needs were addressed in close cooperation with local groups .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous people have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous people to their lands , territories and resources ,  
This body would offer the indigenous peoples a window on the world , enabling them to assert their rights , whether civil , cultural , economic , political or social , before the international community .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
A number of oral and written statements were submitted to the Subcommission on various issues , such as the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , right to development , religious intolerance , protection of minorities , indigenous persons , and terrorism and human rights . 
Article 8 ( j ) is also directly related to three other provisions of the Convention : article 10 ( c ) , dealing with customary use of biological resources ; article 17.2 , dealing with exchange of information relevant to indigenous and traditional knowledge ; and articles 18.4 and 15 , dealing with technical and scientific cooperation , including indigenous and traditional technologies and access to genetic resources , respectively .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , young persons , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
National plans of action for human rights education , which have been called for both by the General Assembly and the Commission , are intended to be an integral part of the national development plan ( when applicable ) and be complementary to other relevant national plans of action already defined ( general human rights plans of action or those relating to women , children , minorities , indigenous peoples , etc . ) .  
Attention continued to be focused on disadvantaged persons in peasant and indigenous settlements , as well as on the improvement , during this period , of services in the outlying neighbourhoods of Asuncin , which were reorganized and rescaled because they were out of step with the actual demographic situation and the demand for services .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
It was said that members could be elected or appointed for a limited period of time on a rotating basis , and they could serve either in an official or in a personal capacity , in particular indigenous representatives stated that the status of the representatives should be equal . 
Many indigenous representatives expressed the view that the forum should be established as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council , while other indigenous representatives considered that it should be linked to the Economic and Social Council , in one way or another , although they were not in a position to identify the exact placement in the system at the current time .  
The representative of Paraguay expressed support for the creation of a permanent forum which would coordinate , promote and advise on all issues regarding indigenous peoples , including their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights . 
In a joint statement , the Saami Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference stated that the forum should be established as a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council and should be composed of an equal number of representatives of indigenous peoples and Governments , acting as full voting members on an equal basis .  
The Chairman-Rapporteur noted that no governmental delegation had expressed formal opposition to the establishment of a permanent forum for indigenous peoples within the United Nations system , although a number of Governments had stated that they had not yet taken a final position with regard to whether a new forum should be established , or whether it would be sufficient to broaden the mandate of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations .  
In addition , sample surveys and qualitative studies , such as the rapid assessment approach , are common sources for data on a large number of economic , social and demographic issues ; but they are not always large enough to provide reliable estimates on indicators for smaller population groups , such as indigenous populations , or on characteristics such as disability that affect a very small proportion of the population ;  
Human services , such as basic education and health care , technical and continuing education , information and extension services , care for the young , old and disabled and programmes to reduce marginalization of migrant , indigenous and other disadvantaged groups , are principally provided through public outlays in most countries .  
Yet the rapidly increasing indigenous labour force in the GCC countries , which is growing by an average annual rate of 5 per cent , with a combined population growth rate estimated at 3.3 per cent annually , have forced the countries to seek appropriate policies to create adequate employment opportunities for their nationals .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons ,  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
We are deeply concerned at the situation of human rights in Mexico , where the same methods are being applied as were used in our country , like the establishment of paramilitary groups , selective assassination and the extermination of civic and popular leaders of the indigenous and peasant communities .  
They have done so in the context of the urgent need for understanding by non-indigenous societies of the spiritual , social , cultural , economic and political significance to indigenous societies of their lands , territories and resources for their continued survival and vitality .  
Rodolfo Stavenhagen states that the entire population of the Americas decreased by 95 per cent in the century and a half following the first encounter .  10 / The intent to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity and bring them under the sovereignty of foreign monarchs created widespread havoc , despite some early attempts at friendly treatment .  
In many countries , particularly those of the British Commonwealth , exclusive use and occupancy of land from time immemorial gives rise to aboriginal title , a title that is good against all but the Sovereign , that is , the Government of the State . 22 / Where aboriginal title is recognized , indigenous peoples have at least some legal right that can be asserted in the domestic legal system .  
Queensland , ruled that the doctrine of terra nullius may not be applied to deny indigenous rights to land , but nonetheless confirmed the power of the Sovereign to extinguish native title .  32 / The Court held that native title may be extinguished , but only by legislation , by the alienation of land by the Crown or by the appropriation of the land by the Crown in a manner inconsistent with the continuation of native title .  
Another discriminatory legal doctrine that appears to be widespread is the doctrine that States have practically unlimited power to control or regulate the use of indigenous lands , without regard for constitutional limits on governmental power that would otherwise be applicable . 
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
Pursuant to agreement with the indigenous peoples concerned , just and fair compensation shall be provided for any such activities and measures taken to mitigate adverse environmental , economic , social , cultural or spiritual impact .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
It called upon members and associate members that have not yet done so to set up and strengthen national mechanisms on ageing , inter alia , to enable them to coordinate the observance of the International Year of Older Persons , and to set specific time-bound targets on ageing and related issues , in the light of the needs and aspirations of older persons , in keeping with indigenous traditions and their milieux .  
Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
Secondly , such a narrow definition of treaties and treaty-making would impede ( or even preclude ) any proper account of indigenous views on these issues , simply because of the widely _ held rationale that indigenous peoples are not States in the current sense of the term in international law , regardless of their generally recognized status as sovereign entities in the era of the Law of Nations .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
As mentioned previously , and given the exclusive character that the term indigenous has in this context , other groups , minorities , ethnic groups or peoples who live alongside them on the territory of a present _ day multi _ national or multi _ ethnic African or Asian State _ whose ( sometimes aberrant ) frontiers are the result of a colonial situation , perhaps legally defunct but which continues to cast its shadow on the present _ would thus be excluded from this category of indigenous .  
A critical historiography of international relations clearly shows the dangers of this particular kind of reasoning , which projects into the past the current domesticated status of indigenous peoples as it evolved from developments that took place mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century under the impact of legal positivism and other theories advocated by European colonial powers and their continuators .  
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
In addition , these contradictions place a formidable burden on the formulation and realization of future negotiated legal instruments between indigenous peoples and States : the difficulties of negotiating those new instruments without having previously identified and settled key questions need not be stressed .  
Lacking such a review , it would be impossible for him to assess whether or not treaty-making ( again , in the broadest sense of this term ) can be considered as an appropriate juridical tool to improve the situation of indigenous peoples in general , to set the pattern for eradicating any discriminatory treatment against them and to gradually put an end to the present _ day antagonistic nature of the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples living together in many countries .  
First and foremost , it must be pointed out that , at present and with very few exceptions - national and international legal texts having a bearing on the living conditions of indigenous peoples are enacted and enforced by State institutions without direct indigenous input .  
Any attempt , at the end of the twentieth century , to arrive at a general approach to the vast , complex , and more than 500 _ year _ old problematique of the indigenous peoples , should not - and can not - ignore a fundamental fact : their initial contacts with non-indigenous peoples from other parts of the world , dating back to the late fifteenth century , were the result of the launching and development of European colonial expansion . 
As a direct result of decolonization , the gap left by the non-indigenous colonial political powers in those continents has been filled by population sectors whose indigenous ( or autochthonous ) condition is indisputable by any of todays standards .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
It is not possible to understand this process of gradual but incessant erosion of the indigenous peoples ' original sovereignty , without considering and , indeed , highlighting the role played by juridical tools , always arm in arm with the military component of the colonial enterprise .  
It is easy to see the negative effects for indigenous peoples of such a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors , not only on their initial sovereign condition , but also on their overall international juridical status .  
It is not the task of the Special Rapporteur in this final report to describe in detail the harsh impact on indigenous peoples of being subjected to a new and totally alien social , economic , and political _ juridical order .  
The process that took the indigenous peoples lands from them left behind very limited and debilitating alternatives for survival : vassalage ( or servitude in its diverse forms ) , segregation in reduced areas reserved for them , or assimilation into the non-indigenous sector of the new socio _ political entity created without indigenous input .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
Nor is it by chance that the Commission , on the very date on which it established the Special Rapporteurs mandate , recognized ( in impeccable diplomatic parlance ) that in various situations , indigenous peoples are unable to enjoy their inalienable human rights and fundamental freedoms ( Commission resolution 1989 / 34 of 6 March 1989 , sixth preambular paragraph ) .  
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
In addition , the outline identified three main sources that were to guide both the process of data gathering and his conclusions and recommendations : public international law ; the municipal law of present-day States ( including decisions by municipal courts ) ; and indigenous juridical views ( in particular , on societal authority , treaties , and treaty-making in general ) .  
Special Rapporteur Martnez Cobo thought it convenient to explore further issues as relevant as the areas covered today by the provisions of treaties and other international legal instruments involving indigenous peoples , whether or not they are observed , the consequences of their implementation or lack thereof for indigenous peoples ( an issue also addressed in chapter III above ) , as well as the present status of those legal instruments involving indigenous peoples .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
Owing to their special relationship , spiritual and material , with their lands , the Special Rapporteur believes that very little or no progress can be made in this regard without tackling , solving and redressing - in a way acceptable to the indigenous peoples concerned - the question of their uninterrupted dispossession of this unique resource , vital to their lives and survival .  
On the basis of a vast amount of documentation , the work of the Working Group and oral testimony , the Special Rapporteur has reached the conclusion that there is an almost unanimous opinion among geographically-dispersed indigenous peoples that existing State mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , are unable to satisfy their aspirations and hopes for redress .  
As a result of his research , the Special Rapporteur has ample proof that indigenous peoples / nations who have entertained treaty relationships with non-indigenous settlers and their continuators strongly argue that those instruments not only continue to be valid and applicable to their situation today but are a key element for their survival as distinct peoples .  
The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that to link the determination of the original legal status of indigenous peoples as nations ( in the contemporary sense of international law ) or as non-nations to the single factor of whether or not they have formalized relations with non-indigenous colonizing powers , is faulty .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
He first recommends the establishment within States with a sizeable indigenous population of an entirely new , special jurisdiction to deal exclusively with indigenous issues , independent of existing governmental ( central or otherwise ) structures , although financed by public funds , that will gradually replace the existing bureaucratic / administrative government branches now in charge of those issues .  
The Special Rapporteur further recommends State authorities not to take up or continue to engage in development projects that may impair the environment of indigenous lands and / or adversely affect their traditional economic activities , religious ceremonies or cultural heritage , without previously commissioning the appropriate ecological studies to determine the actual negative impact those projects will have .  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
In its concluding observations regarding Guatemala ( E / C . 12 / 1 / Add . 3 of 28 May 1996 ) the Committee expressed serious concern at the adverse effects of the economic and social disparities on the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights by the majority of the population , particularly by the indigenous and rural populations of Guatemala .  
The Committee of Experts also stressed that one of the fundamental precepts of this Convention is that a relationship of respect should be established between indigenous and tribal peoples and the States in which they live , a concept which should not be confused with autonomy or political and territorial independence from the nation State .  
Two main issues will be addressed : ( i ) the legal and practical implications of the constitutional provisions relevant to indigenous and tribal peoples , and ( ii ) increasing cooperation between and among government officials , national and international organizations , and indigenous and tribal peoples within the framework of Convention No . 169 , which emphasizes consultation and participation .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party and further recommends that it increase measures to reduce economic and social disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
The Committee reiterates its recommendation to the State party to reduce economic , social and regional disparities , including between urban and rural areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , such as the girl child , children with disabilities , children belonging to indigenous and ethnic groups , children living in and / or working on the streets and children living in rural areas .  
She encouraged a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding between the worlds indigenous peoples and the Governments concerned and expressed the hoped that substantive and practical proposals would be made at the seventeenth session of the Working Group .  
An indigenous representative from Manipur in India said that recent developments in India indicated that existing domestic and international mechanisms to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples , including children , and to conserve vital wetlands and sensitive eco-zones of spiritual value had failed to fulfil their objectives , despite strong efforts by the indigenous peoples in Manipur to protect their human rights .  
He stressed in particular the need for prior consultation and full participation of indigenous peoples in the elaboration of energy projects , for compensation and benefit _ sharing , and for sociocultural impact studies to be integrated into the normal environmental impact assessments .  
She considered the creation of a permanent forum an indispensable next step for indigenous peoples and expressed the hope that within two years a new , innovative coordinating body for indigenous issues within the United Nations system would be realized .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
Progress has been made in those areas to the extent that Governments have not shied away from addressing complex , interrelated and contentious issues encompassing the structure of the State , judicial practices , electoral systems , land tenure , the rights of women and indigenous peoples and the participation of individuals and civil society groups in the decisions affecting their lives .  
Efforts must be made to harmonize economic and social development , achieve a more equitable distribution of income , promote gender equity and implement proactive social policies , with special emphasis on the needs of the most vulnerable groups , such as children , women , the disabled , the elderly , indigenous persons and the unemployed .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
The structure of the Office consists of the Ombudsman for Indigenous Womens Rights , regional delegates , a coordinating board on which indigenous womens organizations are represented , a consultative council composed of members of the linguistic communities and a governmental support commission composed of representatives of various ministries .  
At the same time , the continuation of the public auction of radio frequencies is still giving rise to discontent and frustration in indigenous organizations , which have no resources with which to buy them and are therefore being deprived of a fundamental medium of expression , particularly in rural areas .  
Mr . Cabactulan ( Philippines ) said that more work was needed on the terms of reference for the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit Sharing in order to ensure that the biological diversity within countries was carefully protected , while at the same time ensuring that such resources were utilized in a manner that fully respected the proprietary rights of indigenous communities and enabled the original developers in developing countries to share the benefits .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
The creation of a new relationship between Government , society and indigenous peoples must be based on respect for their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and on peaceful dialogue .  
One of his Governments key priorities was to put an end to the social and economic disadvantage faced by its indigenous people and , to that end , in August 1999 Parliament had passed an historic motion of reconciliation expressing deep regret at the injustices and trauma inflicted on the indigenous people and reaffirming a commitment to reconciliation as an important national priority .  
The achievement of the ambitious but realistic goals of the International Decade of the Worlds Indigenous People would not only solve specific problems faced by indigenous peoples but would also make a substantial contribution to the peaceful coexistence of nations , national minorities and ethnic groups .  
Her delegation had always stressed the need to classify ethnic groups in order to facilitate national policies on the rights of national minorities and indigenous people , and believed that the draft declaration should make a distinction between two categories of indigenous groups , those leading a tribal way of life on isolated reservations and those integrated with the rest of society .  
Legislative acts adopted in recent years would make it possible to define the legal field for developing traditional types of economic activity as a basis for ensuring the viability of small indigenous peoples , developing local self-government and establishing relations based on partnership with governmental bodies at various levels .  
The meetings final document stressed the importance of the active involvement of indigenous peoples in the building of the country and in ensuring the stable development in the North of traditional and modern means of production , with protection of the inhabited environment .  
This political confrontation has effectively pitted local communities against each other , and as a consequence the indigenous population has paid a heavy price in terms of human suffering and remains under the constant threat of renewed violence .  
In the document PGR explained the Acteal massacre as the culmination of long-standing and unresolved conflicts between local indigenous communities , and concluded that the authorities had contributed to the increasing tensions and insecurity by failing to take appropriate action to investigate a series of crimes committed in the region before the incident on 22 December 1997 .  
Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages , which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children , youth , older persons , indigenous people , minorities , the rural and urban poor , migrant workers , refugees , persons with the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and disabled persons ,  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be as broad as possible and contain all matters concerning indigenous peoples amongst which should be included civil , political , economic , social , cultural , developmental , environmental , health , education , language , land , resources , territorial , gender and children ' s rights.In particular , it should deal with the following , among others : 
The establishment of the permanent forum should have a positive impact on construction and development for indigenous peoples in areas such as economic , political , social and cultural rights , human rights , the environment , health and the expansion of cross _ cultural bilingual education based on the world view of the indigenous peoples in each State .  
We are of the opinion that the workshops and conferences held on the subject of the permanent forum reveal a consensus in favour of endowing the permanent forum with competence in respect not only of the cultural , economic , social and political rights of the indigenous peoples but also educational and health matters affecting the indigenous peoples , with a view to promoting better services corresponding to their way of life .  
This also would include the development of codes of conduct and frameworks of legislation for the control of invasive and exotic plant and animal species in small island developing States in view of their potential negative impact on indigenous or endemic species .  
The observer for the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru stated that , while considering the draft declaration , special attention should be given to such notions as the recognition of the right of indigenous peoples to define themselves as peoples , the principle of self-determination , the exercise of collective ancestral ownership of land , the sovereignty over natural resources , the legal protection of cultural and intellectual property .  
The observer for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference reiterated support for the draft declaration in its current form which , if adopted , would guarantee the political , social , economic and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and lead to a path of peace based on mutual respect .  
The observer for the Saami Council stated that the draft declaration guaranteed the basic rights and fundamental political and legal rights of indigenous peoples and that it constituted a major breakthrough principally because it underlined the principle of equality for indigenous peoples ; this had usually been denied on the grounds of discrimination . 
All indigenous peoples have a collective and individual right to free , comprehensive and diversified education at all levels and in all forms of basic , middle and higher education in their own languages , including bilingual education .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
The mandate of the permanent forum should be broad enough to cover the concerns of indigenous peoples , including cultural , civil , political and economic rights , health issues , the rights of women and children , education , development , the environment , human rights and conflict prevention and resolution ;  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
In its resolution 37-90 of 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly decided that , in accordance with the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , 1 the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be directed towards , among other things , stimulating the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in developing countries .  
The Chairperson-Rapporteur proposed a revised work programme which would not include a time-frame for informal governmental meetings , but would allow for the plenary to be suspended if requested by the participants , whether governmental or indigenous representatives , and when the chairperson considered it useful and a contribution to the process .  
He said he hoped the working group would be able to draft a declaration in which States were encouraged to consider a broad range of autonomy for indigenous groups in managing their local and internal affairs , including economic , social and cultural matters .  
The representative of Australia recognized that the intention of article 3 was to enunciate a key concept in the draft declaration , namely the legitimate aspirations of indigenous peoples to enjoy more direct and meaningful participation in decision-making and political processes and greater autonomy over their own affairs .  
The representative of the Assembly of First Nations emphasized the importance of understanding the spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship indigenous peoples had had with their land , territories and water resources .  
For that reason , the achievement of international recognition for the sacred , basic and fundamental right of indigenous peoples to own , develop , use , control and occupy their traditional lands and resources was imperative and urgent .  
She also said that the draft declarations precise restitution criteria were unnecessarily limiting and , as an example , stated that article 27 could include a number of alternatives for providing fair and just consideration to the satisfaction of the indigenous groups concerned.She proposed that that article should be expanded with a separate provision for providing adequate processes for dealing with land claims .  
He expressed concern at the broad language of article 26 , which seemed to give indigenous peoples the right to ownership of land they had traditionally occupied or otherwise used , but pledged his delegations commitment to continuing to work towards a positive resolution of the language of such a valuable article .  
All indigenous peoples have a collective and individual right to compulsory , free , comprehensive and diversified education at all levels and in all forms of basic , middle and higher education in their own languages , including bilingual education .  
States shall take effective measures , with the full consent of the peoples concerned , to eliminate detrimental attitudes of superiority and racial discrimination and to promote tolerance , understanding and friendly relations between indigenous peoples and segments of the national community .  
Under the international conventions adopted by ILO and pursuant to national labour legislation , indigenous peoples are fully entitled to employment , free choice of employment , satisfactory conditions of employment , medical care and social security , without distinction or discrimination on grounds of race or identity .  
That neoracism was directed against vulnerable social groups such as migrant workers , refugees , ethnic or religious minorities and indigenous populations , who were reproached for being different ; that difference , instead of being celebrated as a source of richness and complementarity , became a synonym for rejection and discrimination .  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
Forest valuation should reflect the social , cultural , economic and ecological context and consider values that are important to local and / or indigenous communities , private forest owners , gender aspects , and distributional impacts .  
Create permanent national and local working groups that include the participation of Governments , NGOs , womens groups and indigenous peoples to ensure that sexual and reproductive rights are explicitly covered in policies and legal reform .  
In Ecuador , a team of international and national UNV volunteers assisted indigenous communities living in areas afflicted by increasing poverty and environmental degradation .  
Nothing in this declaration may be construed as diminishing or extinguishing existing or future rights indigenous peoples may have or acquire under national or international law ; neither may it be construed as violating universal standards of human rights .  
The most encouraging and productive of these measures appear to be those that are based on fair and voluntary negotiations between the State and the indigenous people , either at the national level or under the auspices of an international body .  
The political will expressed by the Government to improve the implementation of its international human rights obligations should be seen as a generally hopeful sign of respect for indigenous rights as well and should be commended and encouraged .  
The poor of the subregion included the elderly , children , the disabled , smallscale farmers , unskilled workers , the indigenous population and in some countries femaleheaded households , as well as the underemployed and unemployed .  
The knowledge and wisdom of indigenous and local communities is critical to the conservation and management of much of the worlds biological diversity and natural resources and can add value to contemporary , scientific ways of thinking .  
Liberalization is not possible in LDCs since indigenous human and technological capacities have to be developed first , supported by the gradual removal of protectionist measures and progressive application of international standards .  
In the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups for instance indigenous people , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with HIV / AIDS .  
The World Conference would offer an exceptional opportunity to examine a wide range of issues of the utmost relevance today , including ethnic cleansing , the emergence of contemporary forms of slavery , traffic in humans , discrimination against minorities , migrant workers , indigenous peoples and refugees , the preservation of cultural identity in multi-cultural societies , racism on the Internet , and new and more subtle forms of racism .  
In addition to the five major themes on its agenda , the World Conference should also take up other important issues , especially ways to reduce ethnic tensions and to prevent ethnic and racial conflicts ; the economic impact of racism ; discrimination against migrant workers ; the question of asylum-seekers , refugees and disabled persons ; trafficking in human beings ; assaults on minorities and vulnerable groups ; the rights of indigenous peoples ; and the role of the Internet and of communications technologies .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
In Australia , where , a few decades previously , the Government had abducted over 100,000 aboriginal children in order to place them with white families , discrimination against and segregation of indigenous people continued and their economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to own land , were restricted . 
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Underlines that in the process of the realization of the right to development , special attention should be given to persons belonging to minorities , whether national , ethnic , religious or linguistic , as well as to persons belonging to vulnerable groups , for instance elderly people , indigenous people , persons facing discrimination on multiple grounds , Roma , migrants , persons with disabilities , children and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , and that this attention should have a gender perspective ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Recognizing that States must protect and promote the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous women , women who are of people of African descent , migrants , internally displaced , asylum-seekers or refugees as well as other vulnerable women , further recognizing that they are important actors and that the enjoyment of their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights is essential for the development of societies throughout the region ,  
Fully recognize all of the rights of the indigenous peoples in conformity with the principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States ; in concert with them the necessary constitutional , administrative , legislative and judicial reforms must be promoted , including those derived from applicable international instruments ;  
Urge States to adopt or strengthen , as appropriate , national programmes for eradicating poverty among indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , and also request that they expand their efforts to foster bilateral , regional and international cooperation in implementing those programmes ;  
Urge States to establish , on the basis of existing statistical information , national programmes , including affirmative action measures , to promote the access of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities to education , medical care and basic social services ;  
Invite States to promote and support the establishment and functioning of enterprises , owned by indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities favouring access to credits and training programmes ;  
Request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a fourth branch within her Office to foster activities to combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to promote the rights of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Request States to adopt public policies and give impetus to programmes on behalf of indigenous women , with a view to promoting their civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights ; to putting an end to their situation of disadvantage for reasons of gender ; to dealing with urgent problems affecting them , in education and in the economy and in the matter of domestic violence ; and to eliminating the situation of discrimination suffered by indigenous women on multiple grounds of racism and gender discrimination ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
Further request States to take additional steps to protect economic , political , social and cultural rights on a non-discriminatory basis , by ensuring an increase in the delivery of public services and access to social justice and rights for indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities ;  
Stress that education and training programmes , as well as other social policies , should promote more inclusive societies , encouraging stable and harmonious relationships and friendships between different nations , peoples and groups , fostering mutual understanding , solidarity , tolerance , development of a culture of peace , the study of the Holocaust and injustice against indigenous peoples and people of African descent in the Americas , social justice and respect for human rights for all ;  
Also urge them to provide an accurate presentation of the history of the State , highlighting the contributions of the different culture and civilizations of the region and the world , including the role that indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities have played in building national identities in the Americas , and historical and contemporary examples of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance directed against these groups ;
