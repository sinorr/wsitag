The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
The coming to power of the coalition of the right-wing Likud with other extreme forces a few months ago led to the application of their declared programme , which aims at increasing Jewish immigration , consolidating , expanding , developing and increasing the number of settlements , and imposing land seizures and forceful expropriation .

In the face of reassertion of ethnic - some may call it tribal - identities , of revival of neo-liberal ideas based on extreme individualism and deregulation , as well as of other centrifugal forces , it becomes imperative at the international level to insist on general , as opposed to particular , State interests and to work towards the development of a public order of the international community .  
At the Workshop , which was held in the form of a free discussion , the participants agreed on the urgent need to protect those who were exposed to extreme suffering resulting from a lack of sufficient protection .

It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
The United States attached extreme importance to compliance with General Assembly resolutions 49 / 116 and 51 / 36 and encouraged all flag States of the international community to take measures to prevent fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag from fishing in zones under the jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized , and to ensure that such fishing operations were conducted in accordance with the conditions set out in such authorization .

However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .

The Special Rapporteur appreciates the modest progress achieved in the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , as indicated by the figures contained in the corresponding chapter , although the progress is still manifestly insufficient to enable 65 per cent of the population of Equatorial Guinea to escape from the extreme poverty in which they are living .  
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;

A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
In extreme cases , where coercive economic measures are most likely to have important long-term effects , such measures are usually multilateral , comprehensive in scope , extensive in duration and also frequently coincide with civil or other military conflict that also thwarts economic development .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
Further , widespread discrimination based on gender , ethnicity and religious belief is reported daily and extreme poverty and marginalization is the fate of many in both developing and developed countries .  
This has acquired additional importance in the light of the recent analysis of four intact 155-mm shells filled with mustard of the highest quality ( purity of 94 to 97 per cent ) , even after seven years of exposure to extreme climatic conditions .

The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
It was recognized that extreme poverty hindered full enjoyment of human rights and that economic , social , political and cultural rights were universal and inseparable .  
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,

The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .

Considering corruption to be an extreme evil and a serious obstacle to the development of a healthy democracy , the Albanian Parliament and Government have adopted tough legislative and administrative measures to deal with it , establishing specific structures to better uncover and punish abuse of power in certain corrupt sectors of the administration and the judiciary .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
In addition , the Commission on Human Rights has established special procedures mandates covering economic and social rights and the right to development , including the appointment of an independent expert on structural adjustment policies , special rapporteurs on the right to education and on foreign debt , and independent experts on extreme poverty and the right to development .  
However , along with these common interests , the following point must be made clear : A democratic country like Israel can not accept a precondition to beginning the talks that requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the opposing side .  
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .

As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
Since her appointment , the independent expert held permanent consultations with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and visited several countries ( Albania , Bulgaria , France , Portugal and Yemen ) where she held consultations with Governments , international organizations , United Nations bodies , Programmes and Funds , as well as key non _ governmental organizations with extensive knowledge on human rights and extreme poverty .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .

This taboo has now been shattered and it is with extreme satisfaction that the Special Rapporteur notes the growing commitment of civil society in countries affected by harmful traditional practices , especially female genital mutilation .  
It should be stressed that some of these gross breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
The Special Rapporteur asks for urgent national and international action at all levels to combat extreme poverty and social exclusion , whose spread may lead to continued instability that could weaken the peace process and impede peaceful coexistence .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Extreme poverty and thus the lack of basic social services is a violation of human rights because extreme poverty is the main obstacle to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day . 
This debate has been made necessary by an explosive situation that has followed the exacerbation of violence in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem a perverse sequence of indiscriminate or targeted assassinations , outbursts of anger and extreme and disproportionate retaliatory measures on the part of the Israeli troops , and almost desperate retaliatory actions , to say nothing of heinous acts of opportunism on the part of well-known unrepentant extremists .  
As the representative of Bhutan had said at the fifty-first session of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it was of paramount importance to draw a clear distinction between genuine refugees and illegal and economic migrants motivated to leave their countries by the population explosion , environmental degradation and extreme poverty because , by devoting to them the slender resources available to it , UNHCR would merely encourage illegal immigration and deprive genuine refugees of the assistance they needed .  
During his official mission to South Africa in October 1997 , the Special Rapporteur pointed out that failure to sanction mercenary organizations and racist groups of the extreme right might well open the way for future terrorist attacks , and he now notes with concern that , during 2000 , 21 explosive devices were set off in Cape Town , as a result of which 3 persons were killed and 130 injured . 
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .

Some serious breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) , whereas others are general wrongs which in circumstances of extreme or systematic application may amount to serious breaches which affect all members of the international community . 
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .

The Republican-led government can not blindly imitate the China policies of the Clinton administration , nor can it go back to the doctrine of " strategic partnership . "  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .

In the face of reassertion of ethnic - some may call it tribal - identities , of revival of neo-liberal ideas based on extreme individualism and deregulation , as well as of other centrifugal forces , it becomes imperative at the international level to insist on general , as opposed to particular , State interests and to work towards the development of a public order of the international community .  
At the Workshop , which was held in the form of a free discussion , the participants agreed on the urgent need to protect those who were exposed to extreme suffering resulting from a lack of sufficient protection .  
The many initiatives which had subsequently led to the drafting of new instruments were considered by delegations as particularly valuable , as was the exploration of especially critical problems encountered in the modern world , including attention to issues in the field of social and economic rights , such as the right to housing , extreme poverty and indigenous rights . 
Deeply concerned that extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and seriously affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Deeply concerned by the fact that extreme poverty continues to spread throughout the countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social or cultural situation , and gravely affects the most vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals , families and groups , who are thus hindered in the exercise of their human rights and their fundamental freedoms ,  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , with a view to enabling the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
This view includes situations of extreme poverty and economic and social under-development , human rights violations , massive flows of refugees , civil wars resulting from ethnic conflicts , extreme degradation of the environment , terrorism , and even certain socio-political phenomena such as corruption , drug trafficking and international crime ; it also includes religious fundamentalism , which in recent years has aggressively invaded several regions of the world . 
The United States attached extreme importance to compliance with General Assembly resolutions 49 / 116 and 51 / 36 and encouraged all flag States of the international community to take measures to prevent fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag from fishing in zones under the jurisdiction of other States unless duly authorized , and to ensure that such fishing operations were conducted in accordance with the conditions set out in such authorization .  
Other social groups that can be identified include ethnic and religious minorities ; indigenous people ; refugees and displaced persons ; migrants and migrant workers , both legal and illegal , as well as family members left behind ; prisoners and ex-offenders ; addicts and former addicts ; squatters ; street children ; people living in extreme poverty ; and landless rural workers .  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
At the eleventh summit of Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group , held in Asunci \ x { 93ee } , Paraguay , in August this year , our leaders agreed that the elimination of extreme poverty , the achievement of social justice , the promotion of forms of citizen participation , as well as the improvement of standards of living and the general welfare of our peoples are permanent objectives for our countries and can be more easily achieved through cooperation and coordination between democratic Governments .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
The Special Rapporteur appreciates the modest progress achieved in the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , as indicated by the figures contained in the corresponding chapter , although the progress is still manifestly insufficient to enable 65 per cent of the population of Equatorial Guinea to escape from the extreme poverty in which they are living .  
Security at the office in Kigali was lax in the extreme ; private security officers did not check identifications ; they were observed sleeping at their posts and were not supervised by international staff on nights and weekends ; pass procedures were so poor as to be non-existent ; the front desk and front gate were observed unattended , with the gate and front door wide open .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
Also calls upon the Government of Guatemala to continue , on the basis of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace and in accordance with its timetable , to adopt and develop concrete measures against extreme poverty , using national resources and with international support , to enable the population to attain better living standards , giving priority to economic and social development programmes which respond adequately to the most urgent needs of the Guatemalan people in general and the indigenous communities in particular ;  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .  
The Sub _ Commission recognizes the efforts of the Government of Guatemala and urges it to continue with its policy of implementing measures for the protection and promotion of both individual and collective human rights and fundamental freedoms ; to continue to take practical measures against poverty and to eradicate extreme poverty in order to raise the living standards of the population ; and to redouble the efforts already instituted to overcome the marginalization and discrimination to which the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have been , and continue to be subjected .  
In extreme cases , where coercive economic measures are most likely to have important long-term effects , such measures are usually multilateral , comprehensive in scope , extensive in duration and also frequently coincide with civil or other military conflict that also thwarts economic development .  
This is a space devoid of the most basic human values ; a space in which children are slaughtered , raped and maimed ; a space in which children are exploited as soldiers ; a space in which children are starved and exposed to extreme brutality .  
Further , widespread discrimination based on gender , ethnicity and religious belief is reported daily and extreme poverty and marginalization is the fate of many in both developing and developed countries .  
This has acquired additional importance in the light of the recent analysis of four intact 155-mm shells filled with mustard of the highest quality ( purity of 94 to 97 per cent ) , even after seven years of exposure to extreme climatic conditions .  
Natural hazards have thus been defined as extreme geophysical events , biological processes and major technological accidents , characterized by concentrated releases of energy or materials that pose a largely unexpected threat to humans .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Fully cognizant of the threat which widespread extreme poverty represents for the effective enjoyment of human rights , CARICOM Governments have invariably sought to attain a decent standard of living for their people .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
It was recognized that extreme poverty hindered full enjoyment of human rights and that economic , social , political and cultural rights were universal and inseparable .  
In order to guarantee international security and stability , the United Nations must also , in the context of the current reform process , reassess and redefine its responses to current problems , particularly extreme inequalities with respect to international trade and capital flows , the continual deterioration of the terms of trade , external debt , population growth , the problem of migration , the depletion of natural resources and environmental constraints .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
To secure progressively , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
From our point of view , the crisis in the Balkans should encourage the international community to seek a better understanding of the extreme importance of joint activities , within the framework of decisions taken by United Nations bodies , towards the settlement of ethnic conflicts by peaceful means in order to maintain peace , protect human rights and provide an opportunity to every person for the unhampered achievement of his or her human and spiritual potential .  
Of particular concern are certain vulnerable groups of children , including children with disabilities , particularly mental disabilities , girls , particularly Vidomegons , children living in remote rural areas , children living in extreme poverty , children living and / or working on the street , refugee and asylum _ seeking children , children in the juvenile justice system , children born out of wedlock , children of incestuous relations , and institutionalized children .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
Mercenarism occurs in inverse proportion to peace , political stability , respect for the legal and democratic order , the ability to exploit natural resources in a rational manner , a well-integrated population and a fair distribution of development which prevents extreme poverty .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
Moreover , Mexico has promoted the initiatives included in resolution 53 / 77 Y at both the regional and international levels , especially those intended to underline the extreme urgency of initiating negotiations on nuclear disarmament and the adoption of a consistent action programme that will lead us to a world free of nuclear weapons .  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
Considering corruption to be an extreme evil and a serious obstacle to the development of a healthy democracy , the Albanian Parliament and Government have adopted tough legislative and administrative measures to deal with it , establishing specific structures to better uncover and punish abuse of power in certain corrupt sectors of the administration and the judiciary .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Considering the content of the subject matter , the emergence of extreme poverty was examined from various angles taking into account both the domestic and international dimensions of the problem and the economic , political and social factors contributing to it .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
With the recent resurgence of old ethnic , racial and nationalist antagonisms in various forms of intolerance , xenophobia and , in the most extreme cases , ethnic conflict , ethnic cleansing and genocide , United Nations human rights mechanisms are compelled to reflect on situations where the occurrence of racist acts and racial discrimination could degenerate into open conflict , and recommend timely specific and adequate preventive measures .  
In addition , the Commission on Human Rights has established special procedures mandates covering economic and social rights and the right to development , including the appointment of an independent expert on structural adjustment policies , special rapporteurs on the right to education and on foreign debt , and independent experts on extreme poverty and the right to development .  
However , along with these common interests , the following point must be made clear : A democratic country like Israel can not accept a precondition to beginning the talks that requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the opposing side .  
At its special session the General Assembly will have to adopt the goal of reducing by one half the percentage of those living in extreme poverty by 2015 ; this goal must become a commitment at the national level and a mandate for international institutions if we are to formulate the necessary global strategies .  
This network would promote and ensure effective coordination of efforts in the social sphere and would be designed for the immediate implementation of a set of measures aimed at restoring the exercise of the most basic human rights in the most marginalized social sectors such as families experiencing extreme poverty , destitution , abandonment and other social dangers ; and children , adolescents , migrant workers , women heads of household and indigenous people .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
The geophysical characteristics of many small islands leave them vulnerable to extreme climatological , seismic and volcanic events , and more critically to periods of drought , low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion and soil erosion , among others , and they require increased attention to watershed management , land and water use planning .  
As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out , rape as the ultimate violent and degrading act of sexual violence , constitutes an intrusion into the most private and intimate parts of a womans body , as well as an assault on the core of her self . 11 While rape commonly occurs as a manifestation of extreme sexual violence against individual women , rape is increasingly used as a weapon of war , political repression , or ethnic cleansing . 
Since her appointment , the independent expert held permanent consultations with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and visited several countries ( Albania , Bulgaria , France , Portugal and Yemen ) where she held consultations with Governments , international organizations , United Nations bodies , Programmes and Funds , as well as key non _ governmental organizations with extensive knowledge on human rights and extreme poverty .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
International economic sanctions , particularly when imposed by the Security Council , should be conceived in such a way as to avoid aggravating conditions of extreme poverty in the countries concerned.In particular , they should be compatible with the effective exercise of human rights _ and especially economic , social and cultural rights _ by civilians .  
A meeting with the independent expert should be organized in 1999 in order to draw up for the international community the basic elements of a preliminary draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
To secure , through national development policies and with international assistance and cooperation , full realization of economic , social and cultural rights , giving particular attention to the individuals , most often women and children , especially girls , and communities living in extreme poverty and therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged ;  
First , we have set an ambitious objective of cutting in half the percentage of people living in extreme poverty , stressing the necessary links between social and macroeconomic policies .  
This taboo has now been shattered and it is with extreme satisfaction that the Special Rapporteur notes the growing commitment of civil society in countries affected by harmful traditional practices , especially female genital mutilation .  
It should be stressed that some of these gross breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
The extreme poverty faced by 80 per cent of the population , recent poor harvests , severe drought , and the collapse of the social safety net , public health , sanitation and educational systems render the achievements of the peace process extremely vulnerable .  
The Special Rapporteur asks for urgent national and international action at all levels to combat extreme poverty and social exclusion , whose spread may lead to continued instability that could weaken the peace process and impede peaceful coexistence .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Extreme poverty and thus the lack of basic social services is a violation of human rights because extreme poverty is the main obstacle to the implementation of all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social .  
While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day . 
This debate has been made necessary by an explosive situation that has followed the exacerbation of violence in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem a perverse sequence of indiscriminate or targeted assassinations , outbursts of anger and extreme and disproportionate retaliatory measures on the part of the Israeli troops , and almost desperate retaliatory actions , to say nothing of heinous acts of opportunism on the part of well-known unrepentant extremists .  
As the representative of Bhutan had said at the fifty-first session of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it was of paramount importance to draw a clear distinction between genuine refugees and illegal and economic migrants motivated to leave their countries by the population explosion , environmental degradation and extreme poverty because , by devoting to them the slender resources available to it , UNHCR would merely encourage illegal immigration and deprive genuine refugees of the assistance they needed .  
During his official mission to South Africa in October 1997 , the Special Rapporteur pointed out that failure to sanction mercenary organizations and racist groups of the extreme right might well open the way for future terrorist attacks , and he now notes with concern that , during 2000 , 21 explosive devices were set off in Cape Town , as a result of which 3 persons were killed and 130 injured . 
The declaration should affirm the right of every human being hence , also those who are deprived of all their essential rights , wherever in the world they may be to live in an environment in which their human dignity is respected and to enjoy their fundamental rights fully and completely and thus be able to assume their responsibilities towards their families and communities .  It should take into account the efforts and initiatives of individuals and groups living in extreme poverty .  
The exceptional economic boom which followed the discovery of major oilfields in the mid-1990s has not led to any improvement in the economic , social and cultural rights of the population , more than 65 per cent of which lives in conditions of extreme poverty , being denied the most elementary rights to education and health , which especially affect children .  Legislation is not published regularly .  
In October 2000 , the Task Force completed new and / or revised Guidelines for the United Nations Resident Coordinator System in the following areas : adolescent sexual and reproductive health ; basic education with special attention to gender disparities ; maternal mortality reduction ; reproductive health ; and HIV / AIDS . UNFPA is actively involved in the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General , and through the UNDG actively contributed to the preparation of the action strategies on halving extreme poverty and girls education . 
The High Commissioner of Human Rights , closing the seminar , emphasized the need to make the links between human rights and poverty explicit , so that human rights principles would be used both by the poor to know and claim their rights , and by the international community to provide special protection to those in extreme poverty .  
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
Racism was , on the one hand , fear of the unknown a fear which , in extreme situations , could lead to racial cleansing in the desire to eliminate all differences and , on the other , a lack of curiosity , patience and understanding vis - - vis other people .  Yet cultures needed diversity to flourish , while racist behaviour stemmed from social pressure , assumptions and misconceptions .  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
In the Millennium Declaration , the heads of State and Government of the States Members of the United Nations pledged to spare no effort to free our fellow men , women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty , to which more than a-billion of them are currently subjected and expressed their commitment to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want ( General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 of 8 September 2000 , para . 
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
France sought to justify its conduct in removing the two officers from the island of Hao on the ground of circumstances of distress in a case of extreme urgency involving elementary humanitarian considerations affecting the acting organs of the State . [ 70 ] The Tribunal unanimously accepted that this plea was admissible in principle , and by majority that it was applicable to the facts of one of the two cases . 
Some serious breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) , whereas others are general wrongs which in circumstances of extreme or systematic application may amount to serious breaches which affect all members of the international community . 
One might therefore consider that action for the promotion of human rights should involve , on the one hand , action for the establishment , consolidation and protection of democracy , as an expression of human rights on the political level , and , on the other , action aimed at limiting and reducing extreme poverty and promoting the rights of individuals and peoples to development , as an expression of human rights and of economic , social and cultural solidarity among human beings .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .  
A Commission for Social and Human Development has been set up and five key elements for the development policy have been defined : to satisfy at least the minimum requirement of Mexicans with respect to food , housing and education ; to apply a measure of equity in all government policies ; to focus on the population living in extreme poverty , particularly indigenous peoples ; to promote social cohesion and community spirit ; and to protect the environment .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Lack of , or inadequate , laws and labour standards and the illegal or semi-legal nature of the work formed the basis for forced , servile and exploitative working conditions , which varied from humiliating treatment , low payment and extreme working hours , to bonded labour or forced labour .  
However , over a-billion people had continued to live in extreme poverty , with millions of people unemployed , and a growing number of societies breaking up along racial , ethnic or social fault lines .  
Impacts of global warming include an accelerated rise in sea levels , increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events , changes in patterns and levels of precipitation , the drying of arid and semi-arid areas from decreased precipitation , and the spread of vector borne diseases .  
The first victims of whatever military actions are undertaken will be the billions of people living in the poor and underdeveloped world , with their unbelievably serious economic and social problems , their unpayable debts and the ruinous prices of their basic commodities ; their growing natural and ecological disasters ; their hunger and extreme poverty ; the massive undernourishment of their children , teenagers and adults ; their terrible AIDS epidemic ; and their malaria , tuberculosis and infectious diseases , which threaten whole nations with extermination .  
Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;
