Judging from the present situation , our social welfare services are inadequate to meet the growing demands of the broad masses .  The imperative task at present is to mobilize and rely on the public to expedite the socialization of social welfare .  This is a task of great importance in building and improving our social security system as well as in promoting social stability and progress .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
The worst victims of the bombing and sanctions were ordinary Yugoslav people .  Because of inadequate funds , many industries , mines , and enterprises stopped operations .  Many staff and workers were forced to take compulsory leave and wrer only entitled to partial wages .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
Jiang Ying says that : In a short dozen years or so , in the area of patent legislation , examination , and institution building , China has done what took the developed nations decades or even a century to do , to the focus of world attention .  But since " our ability and quality in grasping and using patents remains inadequate , in contrast to the developed nations , we remain subject to a sizeable gap . "

The funds raised through the issuance of this additional government debt would basically be used to accelerate progress in national construction projects funded with national debt .  This includes making up for the inadequate local complementary funds for national debt funded projects in central and western areas of China .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
" Having given careful consideration to the facts of this case , and to the established legal principles , the Secretary for Justice decided that the sentences imposed are authorised by law , and can not be said to be wrong in principle or manifestly inadequate , " he said .  
In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .  
" Potential dangers may arise from dilapidated canopies or defective external renderings , dangerous or abandoned advertisement signs , unauthorised building works , defective or inadequate drains and water carrying services buried in or in the vicinity of slopes , " Dr Choi said .

In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management , governmental subsidies , and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .  
The origin and the causes of this crisis are really very complex : but there are some very startling common factors that existed in the Asian countries which were the worse affected .  They are , private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank supervision , poor macro economic policies and poor corporate governance .  
( ii ) An organisation ( Alliance of Patients Mutual Help Organisation ) has recently voiced a fair number of opinions to the Department concerning facilities of public swimming pools , including issues of water temperature , inadequate handrails , slippery pool floors and frequent occupation of family changing rooms by others etc . and has requested for improvements to make the swimming pools more suitable for the use of the above-mentioned people .  
Where direct engineering solutions were impracticable or when these solutions alone were inadequate in reducing the noise to an acceptable level , the feasibility of non-engineering solutions such as traffic management measures would be explored on a selective basis and implemented where practicable case-by-case .  
The spokesman pointed out that major faults found on most motor-driven bicycles and skateboards included weak and misaligned vehicle frames , weak steering handle bar and seating frame , insufficient and unreliable braking system , inadequate lightings and reflectors , lacking essential equipment such as rear view mirror and speedometer .  
Commenting on the analysis of these newly reported cases , Mr Fung said that 245 abusers were involved .  Among them , majority of the abusers ( 68.2% ) were parents of the abused children .  The most common contributing factors of abuse identified were " inadequate parents " ( 27% ) and " children with behaviour / psychological problem " ( 24% ) .  
As the output level of ATS is fixed , the visually impaired may find the sound level inadequate when the ambient is noisy and the nearby residents may find the sound level too high when the environment is relatively quiet .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
In 1969 , an electricity generating plant was built on the island , and in 1978 an underwater cable was completed linking the island to electricity services in Pingtung County . At present , 97 percent of homes on the island are electrified . In the past , drinking water came from underground sources which were high in nitric acid content , and in the dry season , often inadequate .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
" This is the worldwide trend , and we ca n't buck it . " Ding Kung-wha says that most people can still choose to remain aloof and not go playing the numbers game , but if the financial sector continues to expand , and with possible inflation , in the end they will find themselves with inadequate spending power . Looking at it that way , will people finally have no choice than to get involved in the precarious and irrational financial markets ?  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
In the view of scholars of folk culture , the lion museum , with its rich collection of artifacts but its thus far somewhat inadequate " software " such as explanatory materials , guides and research activities , apart from reflecting the purchasing power of private collectors , is also indicative of the unending stream of mainland Chinese antiques flowing into Taiwan .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
While education reform is something that countries all over the world are engaged in , Prudence Chu-ing Chou , professor at National Chengchi 's University College of Education , finds it " unprecedented " that Taiwan , with its limited resources as well as inadequate accompanying measures , is pushing ahead with such sweeping education reforms in such a short amount of time .  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .

Its major premise is that women predominate in informal trade activities in many parts of Africa , yet they often run their businesses handicapped by inadequate legal protection , policies , capital and skills conducive to successful business operations . 
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
We should not lose sight of the efforts and activities by Africa to promote , enhance and achieve sustained economic growth and social development by addressing existing structural weaknesses , particularly building and expanding inadequate human , institutional and infrastructural capacities .

In the view of the authors , the significant international financial support anticipated by the Programme of Action has not materialized ; the science and technology policies and programmes of the United Nations system are hardly coordinated around strategic goals ; institutional and programme adjustments are inadequate and a common operational science and technology framework is absent .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
In Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the problems were identified as inadequate management of fisheries , over-utilization of some stocks , unregulated fishing , overcapitalization , excessive fleet size , vessel reflagging to escape controls , insufficient selection of gear , unreliable databases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
Overly complex administrative procedures , lack of awareness within the judicial process and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of all women , coupled with the underrepresentation of women in justice systems , insufficient information on existing rights and persistent attitudes and practices , perpetuate women 's de facto inequality . ]  
Discrimination in education and training , hiring and remuneration , promotion and horizontal mobility practices , as well as inflexible working conditions , lack of access to productive resources and inadequate sharing of family responsibilities , combined with a lack of or insufficient services such as child care , continue to restrict employment , economic , professional and other opportunities and mobility for women and make their involvement stressful .

Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
Other obstacles to the development of businesses owned by women include an adverse economic and regulatory environment , inadequate physical infrastructure and marketing , poor access to new technology , and a lack of vocational and managerial training .

The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .

The basic reasons for the rising divorce rate were the overall situation of political and economic instability , low incomes , difficult living conditions and environmental problems , and inadequate nutrition for children .  
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people .

Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
The increase in the cost of spare parts , repairs and maintenance is attributable to frequent vehicle breakdowns caused by mountainous terrain , rough road conditions in the Mission area , dispersed locations of outstations , inadequate local availability of spare parts and mechanical skill .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
Furthermore , as indicated in annex II.D , paragraph 4 , of the report , the increase in the cost of spare parts , repairs and maintenance is attributable to frequent vehicle breakdowns resulting from the mountainous terrain , rough road conditions , dispersed locations of outstations and inadequate availability of spare parts and mechanical skills .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
To this end , we must address comprehensively , inter alia , unsustainable consumption and production patterns , particularly in industrialized countries ; unsustainable population changes , including structure and distribution , giving priority consideration to the tendency towards excessive population concentration ; homelessness ; increasing poverty ; unemployment ; social exclusion ; family instability ; inadequate resources ; lack of basic infrastructure and services ; lack of adequate planning ; growing insecurity and violence ; environmental degradation and increased vulnerability to disasters .

Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
The information received recently by the Special Rapporteur hardly suggests any improvement in the treatment of detainees in prisons and detention centres , which he described in earlier reports .  11 / Those reports give an account of the overcrowding , terrible sanitary conditions , inadequate and substandard food , limited medical care , beatings , restrictions on family visits , the problems of having common criminals share living quarters with political prisoners , and the jailing of many political prisoners far from their home towns , which makes contact with their families extremely difficult .

The IPCC welcomed critical comments based on careful scientific and technical analyses , but many of the objections raised had already been considered in the IPCC process and rejected because of inadequate scientific bases .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .

The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
In a recently completed study carried out by UNCHS in Africa and Asia , direct epidemiological relationships between inadequate waste management and the incidence of diarrhoea and , respiratory and skin diseases have been established and low-cost , remedial interventions have been recommended , advancing strong health arguments for targeted investments in infrastructure in low-income settlements . 
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
They included : the particularly high proportion of women living in poverty in southern Italy ; the need to ensure greater participation by women in policy-making ; the excessive glorification of women 's role in domestic life ; the inadequate emphasis on article 4 of the Convention and the absence of quantitative goals for women 's participation in political and public life ; and the need to address questions relating to violence against women from a broader societal prospective which would reject traditional patriarchal attitudes .  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
The practice of dumping ageing nuclear submarines at sea or abandoning them at old naval bases where security measures were inadequate had to be stopped , and abandoned submarines should be recovered before they could cause irreparable damage to the ocean environment .  
Because of inadequate flow in the dry season , these drains represented a health hazard and generated offensive odours and fly and mosquito infestation ; in the rainy season they flooded pathways and public places , increasing the risk of water-borne disease .  
At the social level , living conditions are characterized by poor nutrition , resulting from low purchasing power , and poor health conditions , with widespread disease , including tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The main constraints to increasing agricultural production and raising productivity included the low priority accorded to the sector , poor physical infrastructure , limited utilization of advanced technologies , inadequate access to credit and appropriate technologies for small-scale farmers and the weak linkages between research institutions and farmers .  The Forum urged that African countries give higher priority to agriculture and , in particular , to the need for diversification of production in the sector .  
The proportion of endemic villages having access to safe water was still quite low , however , and only half of the villages possessed water filters in good condition , the treatment of surface water did not include all endemic areas , the supervision of community-level agents was inadequate and the information to lower levels insufficient .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .

Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
The constraints on tax administration in developing countries include insufficient skilled personnel , inadequate equipment , problems of supervision and motivation of public sector employees , inadequately defined or overly complex tax rates , difficulty in identifying taxpayers and in punishing tax evaders , and inadequate accounting practices .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
Reducing budget deficits to manageable levels remains the major preoccupation of Governments , yet an inadequate legal basis , an unstable and exceedingly discretionary regulatory environment , high taxes and complicated tax systems and , in many cases , political uncertainties continue to force economic activity into the rapidly growing unregistered - and hence untaxed - shadow economy .  
While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting materials being discharged into receiving waters , inadequate knowledge about the pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants , the need for expensive and sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants , and insufficient knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants , particularly synthetic organic materials .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
The recent adoption of the amended Protocol II to the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention is considered by many as an incomplete measure , lacking an important degree of efficiency , inadequate in coping with the global scourge of anti _ personnel landmines towards the eventual elimination of these horrendous weapons .  
The complex problems linked to overstocking , excessive donations , poor storage facilities and management , inadequate disposal or waste management capacity , vulnerability to insect plagues and changes in national policies have resulted in an alarming increase in outdated pesticide and chemicals stocks over the last two decades . 
In the health sector , United Nations observers regularly report an exceptionally serious deterioration in the health infrastructure : a high infant mortality rate and high rates of morbidity and mortality in general , poor and inadequate storage conditions for supplies , an unreliable supply of electricity and back-up generators , faulty or non-functioning air-conditioning , defective cold-storage , interrupted water supplies , broken / leaking sewage systems and non-functioning hospital waste disposal systems .

The audit reports identified a large number of administrative deficiencies , which addressed the broad issues of control at the Centre and highlighted the unjustified use of reimbursable loan agreements , the inadequate control over the selection of hiring of outside expertise leading to higher fees and selection of insufficiently qualified candidates .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
Disturbed that millions of women worldwide suffer from extremely poor housing and living conditions , including severe pollution , overcrowding , polluted water and inadequate sanitation , all of which give rise to serious mental and physical health problems and cause thousands of women to die , or to live in a permanent state of ill _ health ,  
Anti-dumping proceedings have been criticized on grounds of inadequate examinations as to whether imported and domestic products fall , in fact , within the same quality segment , lax determinations of causality between dumping and injury , neglect of consumer interests and the legal possibility to file new complaints whenever earlier complaints regarding the same import product have been unsuccessful . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 15 \ x { ffff } . 
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Amongst the harsh realities faced by many returnees are fragile security , the presence of landmines , inadequate judicial processes , threats to governmental authority from rebel groups and the destruction of economic , social and legal infrastructures .  
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
Similarly , the promise to provide a decent living to all has been threatened by the negative effects of globalization and the inadequate attention given to economic , social and cultural rights .  
This remains crucial for the economic development of small economies whose vulnerabilities are intensified by our limited access to markets , narrow resource base , small size , inadequate levels of human resource development and proneness to natural disasters .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .  
While his delegation appreciated the contributions of States to voluntary funds and fellowships for indigenous populations , the overall amounts involved were wholly inadequate for the realization of their social , economic and political development needs . 
Owing to the hard economic pressures created by the comprehensive embargo imposed on Iraq , large numbers of Iraqi women were forced to abandon working life by resigning or retiring from jobs because of fast increasing living costs and inadequate salaries .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .

Most developing countries encounter enormous difficulties in providing timely responses to the demands and to implement the substantive objectives of most instruments and conventions and in putting into practice their compliance requirements , due to their limited institutional and financial capacity , lack of manpower and managerial skills and inadequate or non-enforced national legislative frameworks to support these instruments .  
As we know full well , current armed conflicts almost always reflect historical accumulations of unsatisfied demands , in most cases aggravated by inadequate social and economic situations and by international political and economic conditions .  
Failure in the implementation of policies for forest conservation and protected areas , because of inadequate coordination or existence of conflicting polices and practices , inappropriate implementation strategies or a lack of institutional financial and human resources , is widely acknowledged as a major reason for the failure to achieve forest conservation goals in some countries .  
Because living standards are falling , prices for food and medicines are rising and social pensions are inadequate for the needs of our times , the draft law on State benefits in Kyrgyzstan provides for social benefits for people with congenital disabilities to be raised from 50 to 200 per cent of the guaranteed minimum income , depending on the disability group and the cause of disability . 
The health of the ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
While the developing countries had utilized their own resources in order to achieve the basic objective of sustainable development , it was clear that those efforts would be inadequate without substantial support from the international community .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
In addition , in paragraph 25 , the Assembly expressed concern over continued high rates of self-revision during peak workload periods and occasional inadequate translations , which had sometimes hampered the work of delegations , and emphasized the importance of continuous training for all translators at all duty stations and of developing measures to provide translators with increased support from submitting offices and secretariats .  
This was due to a combination of different factors including , inter alia , inadequate knowledge by national staff of financial management practices and of government and donor procedures as well as insufficient monitoring and supervision at the national level .  10 .  For the 87 programmes that were ongoing on 1 January 1999 , the total expenditure rates are generally higher the earlier the programme started , with some exceptions .  
While recent steps taken by some international financial institutions , including the World Bank , have aimed at better integration of social concerns into the design of structural adjustment programmes , the International Monetary Fund has sometimes given inadequate attention to protecting public spending even for essential social services .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .

A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
While in some cases high transport costs are partially dictated by geography , they are largely the direct result of specific problems created by inadequate infrastructure , poorly maintained equipment , outdated regulatory frameworks , delays in information flows , complex administrative procedures and structures , lack of an integrated transport plan and an overall shortage of relevant skills . 
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;

Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,

The Courts inadequate jurisdictional safeguards especially as applied to nationals of States that had not acceded to the Statute might inhibit responsible international military efforts in support of humanitarian or peacekeeping objectives .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,

The health of ethnic minority women is undermined by multiple factors : lack of access to health services in the sparsely populated areas where they live , cultural and language barriers to effective contact with health staff , inadequate sanitation and nutrition , and low levels of education and information .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
The Working Group noted with concern violations of the civil and economic rights of migrant women workers , including foreign contract workers , who were subjected to ill-treatment , limited personal freedom and inadequate or no payment for their work , without the possibility of recourse to the legal system of the receiving country for justice .  
The five _ year criminal record requirement in the Czech citizenship law , inadequate efforts to publicize the possibility of a waiver , as well as discriminatory and inconsistent application of the law ' s provisions , have deprived thousands of Roma previously resident in the Czech Republic of citizenship and its attendant benefits _ holding government office , voting , obtaining social benefits _ and have exposed them to a criminal sentence of expulsion upon conviction of a crime .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Current legal frameworks , policies and strategies , the report concludes , have proven inadequate to deal effectively with this complex transnational problem , and coordination , at both the national and international level , has been the exception rather than the rule .  
These setbacks can be attributed , inter alia , to a harsh natural environment , inadequate economic policies , recurring droughts and the low level of development of social sectors .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The increasing challenges posed by poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions and situations of armed conflict must be confronted with determination if the rights of children and of future generations were to be protected .  
Programme implementation has also been constrained by the absence of effective planning , delayed and uncoordinated arrival of supplies , insufficient skilled labour and inadequate local implementation budgets .  
The representative from UNAIDS highlighted ways in which inadequate protection of human rights civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights fuelled the HIV / AIDS epidemic , in particular among women and children .  
This worsening situation is attributed to several factors : the adverse political , economic and social environment between 1993 and 1998 ; poor planning ; inadequate implementation ; and a decrease in the quantity and quality of basic social services .  
The mention of the existing legal framework , including the Charter , international humanitarian law and human rights and refugee law , although considered inadequate , appears to be comprehensive .  
Examples of harsh conditions of detention include cruel and degrading treatment , lack of medical assistance , inadequate diet , extended solitary confinement and detention in tiny cells meant for dogs .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
Among the harmful impacts of mistreatment , abuse and neglect , Ms . Popa identified physical injuries , stunted development , emotional and behavioural disorders , inadequate social skills , and loss of contact with family and community .  
For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
Even with improved pumping capacity and disinfectant supply , the operational capacity of many ( and probably most ) treatment plants is simply inadequate to counter the level of bacterial contamination in the raw water intake .  
The internal barriers to SME adoption of ecommerce include limited understanding of the complexity of electronic operations , inadequate skills and high initial investment required to develop a viable ecommerce strategy .  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
The Beijing Platform for Action notes that lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health ( para . 
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The delegations also cited the report of the Secretary-General , which identified inadequate or unaffordable transport as factors contributing to excessive building and population congestion , causing deterioration of local environments , and noted that inadequate urban transport systems are also associated with increased incidence of accidents and adverse impacts on human health .  
In 2000 , the review of the coordinated implementation of Agenda 21 concluded that difficulties faced by the United Nations system could be attributed to constraints such as lack of financial resources , inadequate institutional capacity , cumbersome reporting relationships and inconsistent decision-making by the governing bodies of United Nations agencies ( A / 55 / 78 , para .  58 ) .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Weaknesses in some national laws , regulations , licensing procedures and enforcement mechanisms are exacerbated by lack of capacity , insufficient political will , inconsistent approaches and inadequate coordination and cooperation at the national , bilateral , regional and global levels .  
The 1997 Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict found , for example , that the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Lebanon in the early 1990s remained 50 per cent lower than it was before fighting broke out in 1974 ; that civil war and widespread use of landmines was widely blamed for the abandonment of an estimated 80 per cent of Angolas agricultural land ; and that already inadequate food production in Burundi dropped 17 per cent during recent periods of conflict .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
The resources for ALU , which are insufficient to handle the existing workload , are totally inadequate to address the recommendations in the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to : ( a ) improve administrative support to the missions by reducing the otherwise unavoidable delays in handling their disciplinary matters ; and ( b ) allow for more support and training of administrative personnel in peacekeeping through lessons learned and guidelines .

Lack of , or inadequate , laws and labour standards and the illegal or semi-legal nature of the work formed the basis for forced , servile and exploitative working conditions , which varied from humiliating treatment , low payment and extreme working hours , to bonded labour or forced labour .  
In a document circulated last year , the Group of 21 stated that the prevention of an arms race in outer space has assumed greater urgency because of legitimate concerns that existing legal instruments are inadequate to deter imminent attempts for the further militarization of outer space .  
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,  
An inadequate legislative framework coupled with an absence of procedural regulations has created a situation where persons of particular concern , namely asylum seekers , trafficked persons , smuggled migrants and those at risk of torture or inhumane or other degrading treatment , can not be appropriately identified and guaranteed protection .  
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
However , the Public Information Office is also faced with a population that has a high illiteracy rate , with inexperienced , inadequate and generally poor local media and with weak or non-existent communications infrastructure outside the capital and two provincial towns .  
He did so because his sense as a true believer told him that the correct standards of the faith may be inadequate when a man and his family are starving , and because he regarded hunger as something more heinous than theft , and considered that saving someone from ruin was more important than protecting a persons property .  
Judging from the present situation , our social welfare services are inadequate to meet the growing demands of the broad masses .  The imperative task at present is to mobilize and rely on the public to expedite the socialization of social welfare .  This is a task of great importance in building and improving our social security system as well as in promoting social stability and progress .  
In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
The worst victims of the bombing and sanctions were ordinary Yugoslav people .  Because of inadequate funds , many industries , mines , and enterprises stopped operations .  Many staff and workers were forced to take compulsory leave and wrer only entitled to partial wages .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
The current phenomena of inadequate effective demand and excess of some products and production capacities have emerged under the condition of low social productive forces and low overall living standards of the people .  
Jiang Ying says that : In a short dozen years or so , in the area of patent legislation , examination , and institution building , China has done what took the developed nations decades or even a century to do , to the focus of world attention .  But since " our ability and quality in grasping and using patents remains inadequate , in contrast to the developed nations , we remain subject to a sizeable gap . "

The funds raised through the issuance of this additional government debt would basically be used to accelerate progress in national construction projects funded with national debt .  This includes making up for the inadequate local complementary funds for national debt funded projects in central and western areas of China .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
" Having given careful consideration to the facts of this case , and to the established legal principles , the Secretary for Justice decided that the sentences imposed are authorised by law , and can not be said to be wrong in principle or manifestly inadequate , " he said .  
In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .

In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management , governmental subsidies , and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .  
The origin and the causes of this crisis are really very complex : but there are some very startling common factors that existed in the Asian countries which were the worse affected .  They are , private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank supervision , poor macro economic policies and poor corporate governance .  
( ii ) An organisation ( Alliance of Patients Mutual Help Organisation ) has recently voiced a fair number of opinions to the Department concerning facilities of public swimming pools , including issues of water temperature , inadequate handrails , slippery pool floors and frequent occupation of family changing rooms by others etc . and has requested for improvements to make the swimming pools more suitable for the use of the above-mentioned people .  
Where direct engineering solutions were impracticable or when these solutions alone were inadequate in reducing the noise to an acceptable level , the feasibility of non-engineering solutions such as traffic management measures would be explored on a selective basis and implemented where practicable case-by-case .  
The spokesman pointed out that major faults found on most motor-driven bicycles and skateboards included weak and misaligned vehicle frames , weak steering handle bar and seating frame , insufficient and unreliable braking system , inadequate lightings and reflectors , lacking essential equipment such as rear view mirror and speedometer .  
Commenting on the analysis of these newly reported cases , Mr Fung said that 245 abusers were involved .  Among them , majority of the abusers ( 68.2% ) were parents of the abused children .  The most common contributing factors of abuse identified were " inadequate parents " ( 27% ) and " children with behaviour / psychological problem " ( 24% ) .  
As the output level of ATS is fixed , the visually impaired may find the sound level inadequate when the ambient is noisy and the nearby residents may find the sound level too high when the environment is relatively quiet .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
In 1969 , an electricity generating plant was built on the island , and in 1978 an underwater cable was completed linking the island to electricity services in Pingtung County . At present , 97 percent of homes on the island are electrified . In the past , drinking water came from underground sources which were high in nitric acid content , and in the dry season , often inadequate .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
The development of society in a pluralistic direction and the government 's ability to adapt to a changing situation must be strengthened . The public consensus with regard to national development is inadequate , creating confusion and differences in value concepts that have led to a deterioration in law and order , urban traffic congestion , soaring realty prices , serious environmental pollution , rampant economic speculation , insufficient recreational facilities , and a widening gap in the distribution of wealth .  
Hsiao Yeh , who was once with CMPC and devoted much effort to the promotion of new cinema , is even more adamant : " This has nothing at all to do with new cinema , it 's a flash in the pan , " because the cultivation of film-makers alone is inadequate for raising standards throughout cinema , when " the whole cultural and educational environment has been static for so long , without any improvement .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
National Yang Ming University professor of public health Lan Chung-fu , who was the first to put forward a plan for health care network development , indicates that medical resources are precious and limited , and the main spirit of a health care network plan is : to reasonably distribute medical resources , to avoid inadequate supplies and to curb waste .  
But these industries do not yet reflect their real social costs : There is no environmental impact assessment of those social costs , environmental laws are not strict , and industrial investment in pollution control is inadequate . It has been suggested that recently a contradiction has developed between policies governing industry and those governing energy .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Kwan Wen-yen looks at it from the point of view of economic growth . Looking at the current standards of mass sporting events , he says that management of medium-sized 8,000-seat facilities is still inadequate . If the domed stadium is built , it would be OK if it were turned over to the private sector , but if it were managed by the government , based on the current structure , it would be difficult to do the job well .  
" This is the worldwide trend , and we ca n't buck it . " Ding Kung-wha says that most people can still choose to remain aloof and not go playing the numbers game , but if the financial sector continues to expand , and with possible inflation , in the end they will find themselves with inadequate spending power . Looking at it that way , will people finally have no choice than to get involved in the precarious and irrational financial markets ?  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
In the view of scholars of folk culture , the lion museum , with its rich collection of artifacts but its thus far somewhat inadequate " software " such as explanatory materials , guides and research activities , apart from reflecting the purchasing power of private collectors , is also indicative of the unending stream of mainland Chinese antiques flowing into Taiwan .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
The medical community gives two main reasons why there is such wide acceptance of alternative treatments : superstition , and inadequate understanding of cancer treatment . But patients point mostly to the fact that they are tired of suffering .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
While education reform is something that countries all over the world are engaged in , Prudence Chu-ing Chou , professor at National Chengchi 's University College of Education , finds it " unprecedented " that Taiwan , with its limited resources as well as inadequate accompanying measures , is pushing ahead with such sweeping education reforms in such a short amount of time .  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .  
It also results from unresponsive legal systems , overly complex administrative procedures , insensitive judicial personnel and inadequate monitoring of the violation of the human rights of women .

Its major premise is that women predominate in informal trade activities in many parts of Africa , yet they often run their businesses handicapped by inadequate legal protection , policies , capital and skills conducive to successful business operations . 
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
This relates , above all , to attacking on a priority basis the structural factors hindering its development , namely : inadequate infrastructure ; weak institutions ; poor use of human resources ; high vulnerability to natural and climatic disasters ; unfavourable fluctuations in the terms of trade ; the enormous debt burden ; unchecked population growth ; and environmental degradation .  
We should not lose sight of the efforts and activities by Africa to promote , enhance and achieve sustained economic growth and social development by addressing existing structural weaknesses , particularly building and expanding inadequate human , institutional and infrastructural capacities .

Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
In Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the problems were identified as inadequate management of fisheries , over-utilization of some stocks , unregulated fishing , overcapitalization , excessive fleet size , vessel reflagging to escape controls , insufficient selection of gear , unreliable databases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
At the social level , conditions of life are very difficult , characterized by poor nutrition as a result of low purchasing power , poor health , with widespread diseases such as tuberculosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , inadequate educational facilities and limited qualified manpower .

Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health .  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .

The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .

Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
Extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) represents one of the most innovative approaches to tackling the problems of rising industrial and household waste volumes ( which may be either physically or politically hard to dispose of ) , rising costs of disposal and human health and environmental concerns relating to the spread of toxic and hazardous substances as a result of dissipative uses of products or inadequate waste management practices .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
The increase in the cost of spare parts , repairs and maintenance is attributable to frequent vehicle breakdowns caused by mountainous terrain , rough road conditions in the Mission area , dispersed locations of outstations , inadequate local availability of spare parts and mechanical skill .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
Furthermore , as indicated in annex II.D , paragraph 4 , of the report , the increase in the cost of spare parts , repairs and maintenance is attributable to frequent vehicle breakdowns resulting from the mountainous terrain , rough road conditions , dispersed locations of outstations and inadequate availability of spare parts and mechanical skills .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .

The IPCC welcomed critical comments based on careful scientific and technical analyses , but many of the objections raised had already been considered in the IPCC process and rejected because of inadequate scientific bases .  
In Kazakstan , for example , emigration was sparked by social and economic reasons stemming from the decline in production during the period of transition , inadequate social reforms , and the decline in the standard of living , as well as by ethnic and cultural factors and environmental problems .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .

While rapid economic growth based largely on investment in human resources has facilitated a reduction of the proportion of the poor in some parts of the ESCAP region , inadequate investment in human resources has sustained and in some cases actually increased the concentration of the poor in other parts of the region . 
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
This is due to the number and complexity of the polluting materials being discharged into receiving waters , inadequate knowledge about the pathways and ultimate sinks of many pollutants , the need for expensive and sophisticated analytical procedures for some pollutants , and insufficient knowledge of the human and environmental impacts of many pollutants , particularly synthetic organic materials .

Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
Similarly , the promise to provide a decent living to all has been threatened by the negative effects of globalization and the inadequate attention given to economic , social and cultural rights .

The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
While in some cases high transport costs are partially dictated by geography , they are largely the direct result of specific problems created by inadequate infrastructure , poorly maintained equipment , outdated regulatory frameworks , delays in information flows , complex administrative procedures and structures , lack of an integrated transport plan and an overall shortage of relevant skills . 
The debt overhang , inadequate external finance - exemplified by the decline in ODA - limited market access for exports , severe supply-side constraints , deterioration in human welfare and the increasing number of humanitarian and natural disasters have adversely impacted on the economic performance of LDCs . 
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .

In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Current legal frameworks , policies and strategies , the report concludes , have proven inadequate to deal effectively with this complex transnational problem , and coordination , at both the national and international level , has been the exception rather than the rule .  
These setbacks can be attributed , inter alia , to a harsh natural environment , inadequate economic policies , recurring droughts and the low level of development of social sectors .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The increasing challenges posed by poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions and situations of armed conflict must be confronted with determination if the rights of children and of future generations were to be protected .

The representative from UNAIDS highlighted ways in which inadequate protection of human rights civil and political rights , as well as economic , social and cultural rights fuelled the HIV / AIDS epidemic , in particular among women and children .  
This worsening situation is attributed to several factors : the adverse political , economic and social environment between 1993 and 1998 ; poor planning ; inadequate implementation ; and a decrease in the quantity and quality of basic social services .  
The mention of the existing legal framework , including the Charter , international humanitarian law and human rights and refugee law , although considered inadequate , appears to be comprehensive .  
Examples of harsh conditions of detention include cruel and degrading treatment , lack of medical assistance , inadequate diet , extended solitary confinement and detention in tiny cells meant for dogs .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
Among the harmful impacts of mistreatment , abuse and neglect , Ms . Popa identified physical injuries , stunted development , emotional and behavioural disorders , inadequate social skills , and loss of contact with family and community .

We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
The Beijing Platform for Action notes that lack of food and inequitable distribution of food for girls and women in the household , inadequate access to safe water , sanitation facilities and fuel supplies , particularly in rural and poor urban areas , and deficient housing conditions , all overburden women and their families and have a negative effect on their health ( para . 
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
The Committee is concerned , further , at the low standard of the living conditions in some alternative care institutions , the inadequate monitoring of placements and the limited number of qualified personnel in this field .  
The delegations also cited the report of the Secretary-General , which identified inadequate or unaffordable transport as factors contributing to excessive building and population congestion , causing deterioration of local environments , and noted that inadequate urban transport systems are also associated with increased incidence of accidents and adverse impacts on human health .  
In 2000 , the review of the coordinated implementation of Agenda 21 concluded that difficulties faced by the United Nations system could be attributed to constraints such as lack of financial resources , inadequate institutional capacity , cumbersome reporting relationships and inconsistent decision-making by the governing bodies of United Nations agencies ( A / 55 / 78 , para .  58 ) .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .
