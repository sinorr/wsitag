98% of enterprises in Jiangsu Province are small and medium sized with a relatively weak capability for proprietary technological innovation .  They are also restricted by various factors such as their management expertise and composition of talent .  Their current competitive edge mainly relies on the advantage of imported equipment from abroad and cheap cost of labor .  
The expert evaluation panel , including Professor Chen Huanchun from Huazhong Agricultural University who was also a member of the Academy of Engineering , said research of these key technologies had reached an advanced level domestically and some were leading the world level , which offered firm technological backing to the ecological environment as well as the social and economic development of the Three Gorges Dam area .  
In the past few years , scientific and technological achievements that have come out of researching , manufacturing and developing have mainly been new crystalline material , digital color TV with picture-in-picture function , UPS series products , bank POS systems , nationwide computer-controlled cement composite bag bagging machines , medium voltage switches , etc .  
The Anbo company is a key project in China 's nationalization of the production of color TVs , which China built up during the " seventh five-year plan " period ( 1986-1990 ) with wholesale introduction of foreign advanced technology and implementation of general technological contracts from outside .  
He said that Henan Province possessed not only the hardware required for foreign investment , but also integrated the reality of this province to formulate a preferential policy to encourage foreign investors to invest and develop foreign economic , trade and technological cooperation on the basis of national policies .  
This year , China 's economically strong province , Jiangsu Province , has further expanded opening up to the outside world and vigorously improved the investment environment , resulting in its open economy having realized overall rapid development .  Its foreign trade , utilizing foreign investment , and foreign economic and technological cooperation have all shown substantial growth .  
Bangguo Wu pointed out that China 's land-based petroleum industry achieved great success last year , and oil and gas production volume increased by 1.81-million tons and 730-million cubic meters respectively compared with the previous year ; with nearly 1-million tons of shared oil from overseas , its growth rate was the highest since the " seventh five-year plan " period ( 1986-1990 ) ; its economic benefits were considerable , turning over 25.8-billion yuan of taxes , achieving profits of 10-billion yuan ; making great achievements in scientific and technological progress .  
Additionally , the Weihai economic and technological development zone also cooperates with relevant regions in Korea , and has established so far Shandong 's largest exclusive Korean investment industrial park - the Qingnan syndicate .  At present , the Qingnan syndicate has approved 12 entering projects , with a total project investment of 73.1-million US dollars and has preliminarily formed three large industries , taking automobile and automobile parts and components processing as the focus .  
Lilan Zhu , vice-chairman of National Science and Technology Committee , said today at the fair 's opening ceremony that with China 's economic prosperity and rapid technological progress , people 's living standard continuously improving and purchasing capability continuously strengthening , China 's book import market has great potential .  
This meeting is named " the Urumchi external economy and trade negotiation meeting " , while the two previous meetings were called " Urumchi border local region negotiation meeting " .  Its merchant invitation scope extends from neighboring countries to nearly 100 countries and regions such as Europe and America , southeast Asia , western Asia , the Middle East , etc .  Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
According to what was revealed in the meeting , as far as investment direction is concerned , Tianjin encourages Taiwanese investors to invest in infrastructure , base industries , funded technology concentrated industries , and high-technology projects , and to participate in the technological reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , to invest in third industry experimental projects .  Taiwanese financial capital and industrial capital institutions are welcome to come to Tianjin to build up financial organizations .  
Relying on scientific innovation and technological innovation , we have developed China 's first transistor line-relay protective device , the first digital tele-control equipment , and first digital line protective device for 32-bit computers over the past few decades .  So far we have won 198 scientific and technological achievement awards at the national , provincial , or ministry levels .  Our dominant products are among the best in the country and are up to international advanced standards .  
At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .  
These investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness .  These projects have enhanced Shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .  
We should extensively engage in cooperation and exchanges with other countries , fully capitalize on the favorable conditions stemming from our contacts with relevant organizations in foreign countries and our understanding of the latest developments abroad , and take the initiative in helping enterprises improve their production techniques , technological standards , and product quality .  
The detachment also made use of the technological advantages of colleges , and launched several special firing experiments under the guidance of college experts , including antitank missile cross-water firing , pitch angle firing , and firing in nuclear and chemical warfare .  They obtained a huge amount of first-hand information , and accumulated precious experiences .  Based on their training results , they compiled the " training outlines , " which were promulgated and implemented by the whole army .  
He spoke highly of the remarkable achievements scored by Shaanxi Province in recent years through the exploitation of its own advantages in such fields as the reform of tertiary educational management structure , the improvement in the teachers ' living conditions , the promotion of socialized logistic service in schools , and the acceleration of the transformation and industrialization of scientific and technological achievements .  He hopes that Shaanxi will display its advantages as a major province in education and science and technology to make still greater contributions to the large-scale development in West China .  
Cao Gangchuan noted : Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , China 's scientific and technological undertaking for national defense has realized a historic leap of growing out of nothing and expanding from weak to strong and from small to large ;  
Ever since the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , in particular , all the comrades working on the scientific and technological front for national defense and weaponry development have firmly implemented the strategy established by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening the army through science and technology , successfully adapted themselves to the world 's development trend of high technologies and changes in the world 's military field , gone all out to make the country strong , and have attained new achievements of world interest .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
Cao Gangchuan indicated : Such a large-span development in the scientific and technological undertaking for national defense and weaponry development has also brought along the progress of the entire country in the field of high technologies ; given a great impetus to the industrialization of such high-tech sectors as nuclear power , aviation , space flight , shipbuilding , machinery , and electronics ; and has made considerable contribution to promoting the economic construction and enhancing the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
Some domestic non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises were also quite dynamic .  " We do not set employment quotas .  No matter how many they are , all the talents will be employed , as long as they are outstanding and are needed by our corporation , " said a pertinent responsible person of Shenzhen Huawei Technology Corporation .  
He said : " China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , a new situation , has made the outstanding professionals , middle - and high-class specialized professionals in particular , more important and popular than never before .  Meanwhile , foreign-invested enterprises and non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises are very keen in market changes and try to seize the commanding height on market with talented people .  
It is necessary to properly handle the direction and intensity of macro regulation and control , combine internal demand expansion , structural readjustment , scientific and technological progress , and opening up to the outside work , accelerate the fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic growth modes , and strive to uplift the development of the national economy to a new stage .  
9.8 billion yuan for the establishment of science and technology development fund , a knowledge innovation project , and increased investment in basic science research and key scientific and technological projects , increasing by 14.6 percent as compared with the previous year ;  
Judging from the actual needs of the current national economic growth , Xiang Huaicheng said , the proactive fiscal policy still requires the necessary policy efforts in order to achieve the goals of ultimately expanding internal demand and promoting steady economic growth and to provide guarantee for quality and efficient development in national economic restructuring and scientific and technological advancement .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
He said : The important speech delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin recently on educational issues was not directed at any specific chance occurrences .  It was an exposition of great foresight made in consideration of the destiny of our country , national rejuvenation , the implementation of the strategy for rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and the development of socialist modernization .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
The provincial government offered rich rewards to outstanding scientists and technologists who made major contributions , gave better benefits to more than 40 academics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineers in Sichuan , established foundations for scientific research project leaders , set up state-level high technology and new technology zones and economic and technological development zones in Chengdu and Mianyang , and attracted a large number of experts and entrepreneurs inside and outside China to start and develop businesses .  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
NPC deputies and members of the CPPCC National Committee believed that the increasing economic and technological exchanges between various fraternal nationalities have promoted national economic development , brought about brisk markets , and improved the nation 's international competitiveness .  
With the approval of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee , the central budget was adjusted ; discount interests on state treasury bonds for increasing investment in infrastructure construction and enterprises ' technological transformation were increased ; extra budgetary revenues were used to increase wages of staff members and workers of administrative units and institutions and to increase social insurance revenues ;  
Third , the work of economic and social development in 2000 should comprehensively implement all policies and measures set forth by the central leadership ; correctly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability ; give prominence to the proper handling of reforms and development in state-owned enterprises , the economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and expansion of domestic demand ;  
Enterprise management should be improved .  Scientific and technological factors should be enhanced .  A good job should be done in upgrading technology , updating equipment , lowering energy consumption and costs , increasing the variety of products , enhancing product quality , increasing enterprises ' competitive power , raising their economic efficiency .  
Beginning in the 14th century , Europe saw the Renaissance , broke away from the confines of theocratic power , achieved unprecedented emancipation of the mind , and produced rapid scientific and technological development .  By the 18th century , Europe achieved the industrial revolution , marked by the steam engine , and completed the transition to capitalist industrial society .  
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
4 .  Article Nine of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall organize and mobilize their members to study Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory ( of building socialism with Chinese characteristics ) ; study current political affairs ; learn and exchange professional , scientific , and technological knowledge ; and enhance their abilities of serving the motherland .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
correctly handle relationships among reform , development , and stability ; place emphasis on the reform and development of state enterprises , economic restructuring , scientific and technological advancement , and the expansion of domestic demand ; and promote sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth .  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
Zeng Peiyan said : We must control population growth , protect and develop the ecological environment , and save and effectively utilize resources to truly base economic and social development on constant scientific and technological advancement , the sustained utilization of resources , an ecological balance , and a clean environment .  
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
In recent years , China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense has attained achievements of world interest , and a great headway has been registered in the development and production quality of key weapons models .  Particularly , the successful launching of satellites , the successful completion of the National Day parade , and the successful launching of the " Shenzhou " experimental spacecraft have greatly inspired the spirit of the nation , and have enhanced the prestige of our country and our army .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Our country has signed government-to-government agreements on peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 16 countries , including Britain , France , Russia , and Japan , and established economic , technological , and trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions , thus playing a positive role in promoting international cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
To promote the application of patented technologies , the exhibition also displays all the patented items that won gold medals and outstanding awards in China in the past , the projects that were selected by the State Intellectual Property Office as showcases for application of patented technologies to industrial production , and some selected patented technology projects that have attained high technological standards and generated good economic returns .  
Both positive and negative experiences show : Under the same material and technological conditions , whether there is a mental force and whether the mental force is strong or weak will have a major bearing on success or failure of a person or a unit 's work .  The impact of this factor must never be underestimated .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
Jiang Zemin indicated : The cooperation between our two countries has also proved satisfactory in the educational , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .  
In today 's world , where economic globalization is making rapid development , scientific and technological progress is changing everyday , and countries are intensifying their competition to raise comprehensive national strength , it is particularly important to stir up and encourage the national innovative spirit .  
In order to overcome several limitations of their combat vehicles , including a long and wide body , a limited field of vision , and so on , the regiment organized its vehicle crew to drive the " Dongfeng " Type-145 truck for a week first in order to find out and feel all sorts of functions and parameters of their extra-long and extra-wide heavy-duty vehicles and this laid a psychological and technological basis for them to drive or operate their light armored vehicles .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
We must strengthen our efforts to cut off the supply of illegal drugs in Yunnan , Guangxi , and other border areas in China 's southwest , northwest , and northeast regions as well as in the southeast coastal region by increasing the use of scientific and technological equipment , intensifying investigation and arrests , firmly stopping the influx of illegal drugs , and strictly preventing the flow of precursor chemicals out of the restricted areas .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
At 10:20 , the command center received from higher levels " an order of recruiting specialized technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment to support the front " .  It immediately started the plan for recruiting technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment from the national defense mobilization database and transmitted the plan to the various command sub-centers for scientific and technological mobilization .  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
The units involved have summed up and popularized the achievements that the army has made in scientific and technological troops training in recent years .  Through repeated attempts for improvement , innovation , and development , they have eventually solved knotty problems that have puzzled the army for a long time regarding operations under future hi-tech conditions .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
In today 's world , the scientific and technological revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds , a knowledge economy is rising rapidly , economic globalization is currently undergoing an increasingly accelerated process , and competition in comprehensive national strength is becoming more and more acute .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
clearly defined the relevant study tasks and targets ; organized officers and men to study electronics science , microelectronics science , photoelectron science and other modern scientific and technological know-how ; and laid a solid knowledge foundation for mastering new equipment , and conducting exercises on new subjects .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
Supervision and management should be strengthened and landmark projects for technological transformation should be accomplished as scheduled .  Technological transformation must center on variety , quality , efficiency , and expansion of export .  High and new technology and advanced , applicable technology should be used to transform a batch of key enterprises in the important industries to develop products that enjoy competitive advantages and to stem redundant development in an effective way .  
During the exercise , this group army employed most of its new weapons , on the basis of a rational disposition and a flexible marshaling ; and by making a simultaneous use of technological means and tactical means and by integrating new and high technological means with traditional means , they successfully gave shape to a fairly complete electronic warfare system .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
These heroic units have demonstrated their new graceful bearing in operating new equipment and applying new technology in scientific and technological military training .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
The PLA 's success in carrying out the activities of exchanging successful experience of scientific and technological military training will yield an important effect on furthering the scientific and technological military training .  The participants in the activities included the leaders in charge of training and education of major participating units ; the leaders of the air force , naval fleets and second artillery bases under various military regions ;  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Therefore , the two sides will continue maintaining the momentum of high-level intercourse and contacts , deepening the mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological realms , strengthening the omni-directional exchange and cooperation in all realms , and improve the communication and coordination in international and regional affairs .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
Today , the tidal waves of a new scientific and technological revolution marked by the universal application of information technologies are sweeping across the globe with great momentum , and the trend of accelerated reorganization of the world economic structure is increasingly prominent .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
Only by comprehensively improving the tactical technological performance of the network of fire according to the needs of operation so that it will remain in perfect shape under various complicated circumstances of the battlefield before it can give full play to its potential in an actual operation and can it really become an " unbeatable rival " of missiles .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
Upon receiving orders , the anti-chemical warfare battalion of a group army under the Lanzhou Military Region immediately took part in rescue work .  Through 34 hours of hard efforts , the battalion successfully completed its task without harm to a single soldier .  It has demonstrated the high technological and tactical level of anti-chemical warfare troops and their indomitable style and fearless spirit .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Although many things in Western economic theories reflect the common regularity in mass production and market operation in an era of scientific and technological revolution , being the reflection of the basic economic relations in capitalist society , in essence , such theories just embody the requirements of the capitalist economic system in its contemporary development .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
These leaders and institutions should make full use of every modern news media to propagate the grand prospects of our military modernization project in an effort to attract more outstanding scientific and technological specialists who must be patriotic and determined to strengthen the motherland so that these talented individuals can achieve merit in their military careers .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
In order to implement Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong army with science and technology and to fully mobilize enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technological cadres , with the approval of the Central Military Commission , the four general departments have jointly issued a circular on raising relevant treatment for some senior experts in our army as of this year .  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
As a vice president and the chief designer of China 's Research Institute of Air-to-Air Missiles , he took charge of and gave direct leadership to scientific and technological personnel designing and finalizing many types of air-to-air missiles , thus making the our country 's research and development of air-to-air missiles climb onto one new stage after another from starting from scratch to copying and self-designing and until reaching the international advanced level .  
On the basis of analyzing these broken fragments , Dong Bingyin led the scientific and technological personnel in dissecting the generator laden with explosives at the risk of their life for a year .  Through conducting nearly 100 major and minor tests and obtaining up to 1,000 data entries , he finally proved that it was the interference of the missile holder which caused the incident , thus paving the way for resuming the range test .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
According to what has been disclosed by a relevant department today , ever since the state started its " 863 Program " 15 years ago , nearly 10,000 scientific and technological personnel from the army have successively plunged themselves into the research work .  Displaying their outstanding ability and talents to the fullest in high technological fields , they have attained a series of major scientific and technological achievements .  
Groups of scientific and technological personnel , consisting mainly of the academicians of the two academies of sciences , experts , and professors , have successively completed some 1,500 research topics ; made breakthroughs on more than 100 major and key technologies ; won 397 Awards for Scientific and Technological Progress at both the national level and the ministerial-commission level , as well as 137 state patents for invention ;  
During the process of completing the " 863 " research topics , the scientific and technological personnel throughout the army as well as scientific research administrations at all levels have also carried out bold practices in the field of high-tech management .  Today , they have opened up a new path for high-tech research and development which requires less input but can yield a higher economic efficiency , and have laid a solid foundation for a sustainable development in the future .  
It was with the spirit of facing the gap , being unwilling to lag behind , striving to catch up with developed countries , being independent and innovative and consistently assailing scientific heights which is upheld by the majority of scientific and technological workers that enabled us to gain our precious foothold in the extraordinarily fierce high-tech competition .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
At the same time , with rapid scientific and technological development , the growing dominance of the knowledge economy and network economy in social and economic development , and continual acceleration of economic globalization , the contests of scientific and technological , economic , and comprehensive national capabilities are becoming increasingly fierce .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
" Substantial Increase " in Three Areas ; Solid Foundation for Rejuvenating the Country Through Science and TechnologyThe Outline sets forth the main anticipated targets for scientific and technological and educational development as follows : By 2005 , the proportion of research and development funds of entire society held in the GDP will be raised to 1.5 percent or more ; the achievements in basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education will be further consolidated ; 
During a major contest organized by their fleet to review scientific and technological training , Zhang and his crew won first place in 14 single categories and became the champion of the whole contest .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
It may promote economic and social progress , narrow the gap between the rich and the poor , and break down geographical barriers to the market and to prosperity .  But it also may exclude or leave behind those countries that lag in technological innovation and drive them to a even lower level of development . "  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
Over the last 20 years , the intellectual property system has become a basic legal system and major policy means of various countries to give impetus to technological innovation , and has played a significant role in invigorating economy and enhancing international competitiveness .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .  
We are willing to strive hard , together with all countries in the world , for the institution of a fair and rational intellectual property system favorable to promoting scientific and technological as well as economic development in various countries , and for the creation of a fine environment of respecting knowledge , advocating science , and protecting intellectual property rights for all humanity .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
The standard attained by a country 's universities reflects from one aspect the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and is also a major expression of the country 's all-round national strength .  
The exhibition reflected Tsinghua 's major scientific and technological innovations as well as the achievements attained in the tackling of major technological hurdles , basic research , and technological research for national defense .  The fields involved information , nuclear energy and technology , life science and technology , new materials , energy and environment , and advanced manufacturing .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The level attained by the universities of a country actually reflects the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and this is also a major embodiment of this country 's comprehensive national strength .  The building of first-class universities attaining the world 's advanced level in our country will require great support from the party , the government , and all social circles ;  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
At times of war , it is necessary to include counter-rescue operations into the entire process of anti-air raid operations , plan carefully , and organize in particular a keen-witted and capable counter-rescue squad equipped with the capacity of making swift responses and a strong maneuverable power , or a relevant squad which has undergone certain technological and tactical training can be designated to assume the anti-rescue task .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .  They are mature and stable in terms of their technological standard , and capable of independently handling more complicated situations .  Moreover , since they are the ones who give demonstrations and guidance to novices , they are considered the " high production units " in the operation .  
At the Guangdong Trade Show , there was one point of view which received general assent : The leap from a large foreign trade country to a foreign trade power rests on transformation of China 's entire economic structure and expansion methods , and within that transformation there must be strong promotion of new high technology export products in addition to the use of new high technology to refurbish traditional industries and raise the overall technological content and value added of export products .  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
For example , we can make use of advanced scientific and technological means to establish an appraisal and evaluation system composed of different quality indexes , which can integrate qualitative assessment with quantitative analysis and can link the appraisal made by party organizations with the evaluation conducted by the masses ; enhance the accuracy and rationality of our selection and our use of cadres ; and minimize the adverse influences that may be produced by man-made factors .  
With the scientific and technological progress and the development of modern education , peasants can master better work skills and richer scientific and general knowledge .  This will provide a major driving force for changing the structure of agriculture and the rural economy .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Major projects manifest the first principle of national goals on a high level , taking their point of departure from solving problems related to the demands of national economic construction and sustainable social development , with a focus on surmounting major technological problems .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
In May , 2000 , the PLA demonstrated in the Nanjing Military Region a series of single-soldier training topics by stressing a reform in the following two aspects : As for training contents , the PLA for the first time prioritized training in comprehensive quality by taking training in modern military technology as the mainstay and training in " three capabilities ( intellectual capability , technological capability , and physical capability ) " as the vital ingredients ;  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
The northwest region of Shaanxi , Gansu , Ningxia , Qinghai , and Xinjiang has a vast territory , a large number of high scientific and technological personnel , and economic characteristics , and the combination of Hong Kong 's funds with the achievements in high science and technology in these areas will turn out to be a big fortune .  What is more , the rich resources there are buried treasures pending development .

Bian Jiagui , deputy director of the Beijing Garrison Command 's Political Department , said that extraordinarily rapid scientific and technological development throughout the world is embodied not only in economic fields but also in military fields .  Military cadres should devote greater efforts to delving into science and technology and continuously improve their abilities in every field .  Only in this way can military cadres set up a solid foundation for being competitive in the non-military sectors after their demobilization .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .

How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
How to make plans for technological renovation , the strategic development of high technology , and the realization of the industrialization of higher technology are of extremely great significance to promoting the revitalization of the country with science and education , increasing China 's comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness , and promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
Minister Zhu said that the reason for prominently emphasizing further strengthening technological renovation and regarding technological renovation , developing high technology , and realizing the industrialization of high technology as work that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the country is closely related to the changes in the general international economic environment and the fact that China 's economy and technology have developed to a considerable stage .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
and eventually enable its government revenue to pick up and rise .  Insofar as international experiences are concerned , the United States began to reduce spending , enhance efficiency , increase scientific and technological investment , and consolidate its foundation and reinforce its internal strength in the 1990s and has attained excellent results .  However , Japan has chosen to raise taxes without reducing public spending with the result that the Japanese economy has stagnated .  
The continuous access of international environmental protection enterprises to China will bring along equipment with high technological contents and fine quality , which is of positive significance to enhancing the overall level of China 's environmental protection sector .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .  The new military means and modes of warfare are still governed by traditional rules of war , including the restrictions of international laws ; there is no legal vacuum .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
Female senior engineer Su Longxu , aged 37 , has developed over 40 scientific and technological accomplishments over the past 10 years .  Out of the total , seven were first-class and second-class awards for military scientific and technological progress , and eight items were awarded national patents .  Ninety percent of the scientific and technological accomplishments have been promoted and applied extensively .  
Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .  
The main content of the program is as follows : emphasizing the conducting of high-tech development in concentrated manner , with the technologies to be developed capable of resulting in the locating and triggering the most effective economic growth points , so as to lay a foundation for fundamentally changing the economic structure , to make exports oriented toward final products with high technology contents , and to satisfy the demand of domestic markets with domestic products of high technological standards ;  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .  
The sustained and rapid growth of the past 20 years has laid down a comparatively solid material and technological foundation for the giant advance of infrastructure construction , particularly in the fields of communications , telecommunications , energy , and so on , and has augmented the reserved strength of economic development .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
Experts say that faced with a new development trend in the world auto industry marked by concentration , development of high and technologies , globalization of management , and by sophisticated production methods , China 's auto industry must develop a modern enterprise system that is adapted to that of foreign developed countries .  Reform , restructuring , and technological innovation are the fundamental way out to raise enterprises ' competitiveness .  
Li Xu'e , vice chairman of the NPC Science , Education , Cultural , and Public Health Committee ; Li Guoguang , vice president of the Supreme People 's Court ; as well as the representatives of the intellectual property rights circles and the enterprise circles have aired their respective views at the symposium on a number of special subjects , such as giving full rein to the patent system and extending support for the growth of those new and high technological products which enjoy both independent intellectual property rights and a sound market prospect .  
The spokesman for the Great Hall Industrial Company pointed out : We have noticed that recently the US media have devoted lots of space to carrying reports which state that the US State Department claimed that in the course of developing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological assistance from the Lockheed Martin Company .  
On 6 April , the " Washington Post " " New York Times " and other media in the United States devoted a large space to the report that the US State Department claimed that in the process of developing and manufacturing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological aid from the Lockheed Martin Company , and this has aroused the concerns of the Chinese and US space technology circles .  
The main method to be used for this task is adopt sound environmental protection standards and technical norms and , based on these standards and norms , build a protective wall to ensure environmental protection and technological quality .  
During his visits , President Jiang exchanged with the heads of state , heads of government , and parliamentary leaders of the six nations in-depth views on bilateral relations and the current international situation .  He also made extensive contacts with personalities of the economic and trade , business , science and technological , educational , and cultural circles of the six nations ; and visited and investigated factories , farming villages , and some representative cultural facilities .  
As the Chinese have more and more profoundly realized the decisive effect of the ever-advancing science and technology on the economy , it can be predicted that the SOEs will pay greater attention , either in an active or passive attitude , to the import , assimilation , and development of the new high technology , and a new technological innovative system with enterprises as its center will be established in China too .  
The State Economic and Trade Commission has proposed to set up technological development centers in over 500 key enterprises , and more than two-thirds of the large and medium enterprises will strive to set up similar organizations within two to three years .  In the meantime , the technological innovative supporting systems geared to the needs of the medium and small enterprises will be set up in 30 central cities .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .  
With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .

He also made extensive contacts with personalities of the economic and trade , business , science and technological , educational , and cultural circles of the six nations ; and visited and investigated factories , farming villages , and some representative cultural facilities .  
In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
The Ministry is adopting economic , technological and legal means , as well as the necessary administrative means , to control the total domestic transport capacity .  It supports and encourages the use of standardized , serialized and modern vessels on inland rivers .  Through relevant legislation , it will gradually take compulsory measures to eliminate cement vessels , wooden vessels , motor row boats , technological backward vessels , old vessels , and barges towed in tandem .  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
In order to suit the changes in the domestic and international markets and meet with the challenges of the WTO entry , various localities must act according to the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important instructions on quickening technological advancement , conscientiously put into effect the guidelines of the fourth plenary session of the 15th party 's central committee , and carry out the work of technical innovation in a thoroughgoing way to promote the adjustment , optimization , and upgrading of the economic structure as a whole .  
Relations of cooperation between the two countries have been constantly reinforced in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural fields ; there have been constant high-level contacts between the two armies ; and exchanges are being carried out in multiple fields and at multiple levels .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
Development of economic construction and scientific and technological undertakings requires the Party and the country to formulate proper policies , the strong support of all levels of Party administration and government , the unrelenting hard work of the numerous science and technology workers , and the common participation of all the people across the country .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
Attention should be paid to increasing the proportion of the third industry , and greatly strengthening the economic vitality of the entire city , while at the same time putting a great effort behind promoting technological updates .  Enterprises developing new high technologies should be put in a prominent position , to allow manufacturing to develop in a reasonable direction .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
Military training by scientific and technological means is a comprehensive and profound change , which will have a fundamental , complete , and deep influence on military training , military struggle , and army-building .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
Taken internationally , science and technology are advancing rapidly with each passing day in the world at present , the process of globalization is gathering pace , the trend toward a multi-polar world pattern is irreversible , and the competition in comprehensive national strength taking the economic , scientific and technological , and military strength and national cohesion as principal contents is increasingly vehement .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
I am convinced , positive scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation among countries of different social systems , economic modes , cultural traditions , and development levels are beneficial to the relevant parties and the entire world 's development .  
It became the first book which introduced China to the West . On 6 November 1970 , China and Italy formally established diplomatic ties , thereby opening up a new chapter of friendship and cooperation .  Both countries have made comprehensive progress in facilitating political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological cooperation .  
In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .  
Such a cooperation is not only reflected in traditional trade and economic relations but has also been extended to scientific and technological , environmental protection , agricultural , water conservancy , port construction , and other fields .  
At present , all the five countries are faced with the arduous tasks of invigorating the economy , of catching up with the tide of scientific and technological development , and of coping with the globalization challenges ; hence the earnest desire to have a long-term stable and peaceful environment for construction .  
Over the past eight-odd years since China and Turkmenistan established diplomatic ties , both countries have gradually expanded mutually-beneficial political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational cooperation , and attained good results in this regard .  
The amendments to the customs law adopted at the meeting are conducive to safeguarding the sovereignty and interests of the country , cracking down on smuggling and criminal activities , strengthening supervision over the customs , expediting the establishment of a modern customs system , promoting economic cooperation as well as trade , scientific , technological , and cultural exchanges with other countries , and ensuring the smooth development of the drive for socialist modernization .  
Since the proactive fiscal policy was put into practice in the second half of 1998 , the Chinese Government has cumulatively issued around 270 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds and the funds raised through the bonds have mainly been used for infrastructure construction , technological transformation , environmental protection and ecological projects , and the construction of educational and cultural facilities .  
Software enterprises that are listed on the pioneering industry board and that give stock options to internal high-level managerial personnel and key technological personnel in the enterprises shall reveal this practice in detail in their prospectus for share flotation in raising capital .  They shall also provide the necessary explanatory materials to stock exchanges according to the demands of the regulations for listing on the pioneering industry board .  
The restructuring of scientific research institutions is conducive not only to making scientific and technological achievements market-oriented , applying such achievements in industrial production , and promoting the optimization , readjustment , and development of our country 's economic structure but to deepening the reform of government institutions , changing government functions , and making it possible for the government to concentrate on the macro - management of all industries .  
We must obtain maximum results from our limited resources , form a complete set of effective mechanisms for competition , appraisal , and supervision , optimize the distribution of the science , technology and productive forces of the whole society , promote the ties , integration and cooperation between the military and civilian scientific research structures , and enable the achievements in technological innovation to be turned faster and better into productive forces for national defense and economic development .  
It has been learned that since the founding of New China , the large number of science and technology personnel and workers of departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work , tackled and solved one difficult technological problem after another , ensured the needs of the development of science and technology for national defense , and made important contribution to the modernization of national defense and economic construction .  
In the new historical period , departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried out reform at a deeper level , quickened development , readjusted their structure , laid a more solid foundation , improved quality , ensured supply , striven to raise their technological level and increase their ability to ensure supply , and ensured the comprehensive fulfillment of their tasks in the development of new products and in their cooperation in production .  
This year additional treasury bonds worth 100 billion yuan were issued and listed in the budget at the start of the year .  While further accelerating infrastructure construction , the central authorities have intensified business technological renovation ; promoted technological advance and industrial upgrades ;  
Leaders of the two countries extensively and profoundly exchanged their views on strengthening political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , educational , and local cooperation between the two countries , as well as bilateral and international issues of mutual concern , including the question of anti-ballistic missiles .  
As a friendly neighbor and a trustworthy cooperation partner of ASEAN , China always attaches importance to ASEAN 's positive role in regional affairs , respects their efforts in building a zone of peace , freedom and neutrality and supports their economic integration process .  China hopes to expand multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in trade , economic , scientific and technological , social and other fields . "  
The proposal stressed : The four countries in the region will conduct multilateral scientific , technological , and economic cooperation in animal husbandry , planting , ecologically non-destructive mining industry , and transnational tourist industry .  They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
First , it is necessary to step up law enforcement .  Second , it is necessary to cooperate with the State Economic and Trade Commission and other departments and implement the relevant policies and handle the technological and capital matters that will enable the large and medium state enterprises to fulfill the anti-pollution requirements .  Third , it is necessary to further strengthen basic work of fulfilling the anti-pollution requirements in industry , analyze the progress of work , find the focal and difficult points , and offer meticulous and classified guidance .

Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must guide and organize high-tech research and development in the light of the strategic demands of national development and the demands of the market , and effectively promote scientific and technological innovation with a view to achieving our own intellectual property rights in order to develop a high-tech industry that is capable of competing in the international market and developing by leaps and bounds .  
Beijing is strong in the fields of science and technology , personnel , intelligence and information , which form a solid foundation for the development of the high-tech industry .  It must launch a number of major high-tech projects with autonomous intellectual property rights and strive to achieve real breakthroughs in the development of high-tech industry , the promotion of scientific and technological innovation and the training of personnel .  
Although the overall international situation tends to be eased up , the forces of hegemony and power politics still exist .  They rely on their economic and scientific and technological edge to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries and attempt to control the world , thereby threatening world and regional peace and stability .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .  This is the main driving force for increasing their income .  At the same time , the advantageous technological and intelligent conditions in the capital should be brought into full play ;  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
A relatively perfect system of agricultural science and education and a system of technology dissemination have been initially instituted , the contingent of scientific and technological personnel has been steadily expanded , the basic research in the agricultural sphere and research on new high technologies have made rapid advances , and some research items have held a leading position in the world .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Li Lanqing pointed out that since the first national meeting of agricultural science and technology held in 1963 , through the unremitting efforts of the agricultural scientific and technological workers and various sectors , we have basically resolved the technological problems in terms of agricultural quantitative growth at present .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
After that , we will take another 10 to 15 years to institute a new-type agricultural scientific and technological innovative system that is suited to China 's agricultural big power status and comes up to the international advanced standards , so that China 's agricultural science and technology will be able to rise to the advanced level in the world .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
fully release the initiative and creativity of the scientific and technological personnel , peasants , and enterprises in disseminating agricultural science and technology , adopt the forms of combining the rank of professionals with peasant organizations , combining the leading role of the government and the guiding role of the markets , and combining paid services with gratuitous services , and break a new path of scientific and technological dissemination that tallies with China 's national conditions .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
Personalities assigned to take charge of the scientific and technological work from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , personalities in charge of the departments concerned under the party 's central committee and State Council , principal leaders responsible for the departments of science and technology , agriculture , forestry , and water conservancy from various localities , the commended advanced persons , and some specially invited academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences attended the meeting .  
continually and positively play a role at the non-governmental level ; further push forward political , economic , scientific , technological , cultural , education , sports , and personnel exchanges between our two countries and exchanges or cooperation between our local governments in all fields .  The people of our two countries should push in an all-round way friendship between China and Japan onto a new stage .  
As extensive contacts and in-depth discussions have resulted in deeper understanding and mutual trust , China and India have come up with a consensus on a wide range of issues , including bilateral relations , international issues , political , economic , cultural , scientific , or technological exchanges , exchanges between governments or parliaments , exchanges between political parties and peoples , border issues , good-neighborhood , and so on .  
Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , pointed out at the close of the meeting : The Agricultural Technology Development Outline formulated by China at the beginning of the century manifests the requirements of promoting a new agricultural technological revolution put forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and is a comprehensive and systematic guideline document guiding China 's agricultural technological development in the future .  
We must regard nurturing of talents as a crucial measure and build an agricultural technology contingent formed by technological leaders , agricultural technology promotion experts , agricultural technology entrepreneurs , high-caliber peasants , and agricultural technology management cadres , thereby promoting independent , healthy , and sustained development of China 's agricultural technology undertakings .  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
While talking about Sino-US ties , he said : Last year , Chinese and US leaders conducted a successful meeting .  The two countries have enjoyed smooth economic and trade development .  Bilateral cooperation in scientific , technological , educational , cultural , military , and other aspects has also been continuously strengthened .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
When the issue of the regulation of supply comes up , people often mention tax cuts and accelerated depreciation .  These measures have positive significance for lowering enterprise costs , improving enterprise competitiveness , increasing effective supply , and promoting enterprise development .  Not to be overlooked are support for the enterprises ' technological transformation and other innovation and the readjustment of the supply structure .  
Four senior officials meetings will be held this year .  The upcoming meeting will discuss the economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region , globalization , the new economy , and other issues of common concern .  It also will study , while ensuring the process of APEC 's trade and investment liberalization , how to push forward economic and technological cooperation and carry out regional cooperation in capacity building and exploitation of human resources .  
With development over the years , the organization has established a five-level work mechanism - - informal meeting of APEC leaders , ministerial meeting , senior officials meeting , and the committees and work group and secretariat under senior officials meeting .  The organization 's work involves cooperation in a broad area , including trade and investment liberalization , economic and technological cooperation , and dialogue on macroeconomic policy .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
- - Comprehensively promoting the strategy of " boosting Shandong with science and education , " sticking to the principle of quality education , leading scientific and technical innovation , and industrialization of hi-tech .  Shandong should work hard to attain a new leap in science , technology , and education , and realize the shift of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers to boost economic construction .  
Mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out and expanded gradually in the economic and trade , scientific and technological , cultural and education , and public health fields , and has achieved positive results .  
At a news conference after the end of the meeting , Wang Guangya said : the senior officials of all participating economic entities unanimously agreed that APEC should advance economic and technological cooperation in the fields of energy construction and human resources while maintaining the momentum of the process of trade and investment liberalization , and should make efforts to start a new round of multilateral trade talks as early as possible on the basis of formulating a balanced agenda .  
Wu Banguo pointed out : Through the joint efforts of large numbers of cadres and workers in the information industry , remarkable achievements were made in such fields as separating government administration from enterprise management , reorganizing telecommunications enterprises , making initial public offerings abroad , improving relevant laws , promoting the building of an information-based economy and society , setting up organizations responsible for the management of computer networks and information security , and tackling difficulty technological problems last year .  
The State Council in 1999 promulgated the " National Scientific and Technological Rewarding Provisions , " reformed the scientific and technological rewarding system , and set up the nation 's highest scientific and technological awards for the excellent and top-notch scientific and technological talents who made outstanding contributions .  
This essential move has enhanced the authority and influence of the national scientific and technological rewards and further embodied the party and the nation 's policies on respecting knowledge and professionals .  This move has also manifested the strong determination and firm confidence of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in implementing the strategy of invigorating the county through science and education and in vigorously promoting the innovations of science and technology .  Hence , this move has already produced and will continue to produce a great and far-reaching influence .  
The new technological revolution , represented by information technology , biotechnology , and nanometer technology , is now profoundly changing the traditional economic structure , production organization , and operational modes and is bringing about a leap in the quality of the development of productive forces .  
The party and state 's ample rewards to scientific and technological personnel and the hard working and enterprising spirit of the awarded scientists will certainly and utterly inspire the national pride and self-confidence of numerous scientific and technological workers as well as the people throughout the country .  This will also encourage the vast numbers of scientific and technological workers to blaze new trials , initiate undertakings , scale the scientific heights of the world , overcome new challenges , and win a new victory .  
Practice has proved that the series of major decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core are correct ; all localities and departments have been effective in implementing the line , principles , and policies of the central authorities ; and the vast numbers of scientific and technological personnel , educational workers , as well as people from all social circles on the united front have made remarkable contribution to the country 's economic development .  
The responsible persons of relevant departments under central and state organs ; the responsible persons of the national committees of all democratic parties , as well as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce ; non-party personages ; and all the representatives attending the national Science and Technology Award-giving rally as well as the representatives of the capital 's scientific and technological circles , totaling more than 3,000 people , attended the report meeting .  
While increasing their traditional commodity trade , the enterprises will also gradually expand economic and technological cooperation and reciprocal investments , and will especially advance their joint-venture cooperation in the high-tech field .  This will not only enhance the level of economic and trade cooperation and enrich the contents of cooperation , but will also bring about greater economic benefits to both sides .  This time , a batch of Chinese entrepreneurs with substantive economic strength joined the visit , and this won good comments from the five host countries .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
" To take a look at the possible change of a country 's industrial structure , it is necessary mainly to see the speed of its technological changes . "  Lin Yifu commented that the secret of Japan and Asia 's " four small dragons " in making rapid development in the 20th century was to introduce advanced technology .  As for China , it has a tremendous potential in promoting economic growth by making full use of its comparative advantages to introduce advanced technology .  
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
He said that in order to achieve agricultural modernization , it is necessary to increase the technological content of agriculture , make positive efforts to readjust the structure of farm production with the optimization of species , the improvement of quality and the achievement of better performance as the central tasks , energetically foster leading enterprises , and boost the successive performance of agriculture and increase peasants ' income through the promotion of " integration of companies and peasant households , " " farming on order " and other forms .  
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
This will require the enterprises to form , as soon as possible , flexible and effective mechanisms for stimulating their initiative and motivation to develop new technologies and make technological innovations that will win them a favorable position in the competition .  First of all , a breakthrough should be made in the distribution system and the employment system .  Effective incentive mechanisms should be set up to attract talented people to the state-owned enterprises for making technological innovations .  
Fifth , we should more effectively promote and spread major practicable farming techniques , enhance the quality of farm produce and the comprehensive agricultural efficiency , thus providing technological support for restructuring . 
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
We should use the information net and other advanced technological means to enhance the level of market management and take further advantage of the competitive strong points of commodity markets , while focusing on cultivating and developing markets for key elements such as capital , technology , and labor , so as to promote the rational flow of the key elements of production .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
The department concerned said that the incident broke out after some staff and workers found it impossible to adapt to new production requirements introduced in the wake of the factory 's technological transformation , and learned that the factory had decided to lay them off or divert them to other posts .  
" Independent intellectual property rights must be concentrated on high-tech fields with strategic significance .  We must endeavor to make breakthroughs in some crucial technological fields that have a bearing on the economic lifeline and national security . "  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
The 10th Five-Year Plan proposes that overseas investment capable of exploiting China 's comparative advantages should be encouraged and the domains , channels , and modes of international economic and technological cooperation should be expanded .  
Two years ago , Shen visited the United States as an authoritative Chinese expert in space technology .  In light of the mighty uproar caused by the " Cox Report , " he refuted the report as sheer nonsense from a technological perspective .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .  
We will further popularize advanced and applicable technologies , step up the development of human , scientific , and technological resources , and solve outstanding problems in economic and social development through scientific and technological innovation .  
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries . "  
unswervingly put into practice the strategy of rejuvenating the country with science and technology , give vigorous impetus to scientific and technological innovation and advancement , and earnestly do a good job of the building of the personnel rank to provide powerful driving force for economic development and social progress ;  
The two sides are satisfied with the way their bilateral relations are developing and wish to propel their countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural arenas to develop to a still higher level .  
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region protects the right to own private property in accordance with law and may , on its own , formulate its economic , trade , monetary , financial , educational , scientific and technological , cultural and sports policies in accordance with law .  It will have independent finances , practise an independent taxation system and be a separate customs territory .  
" By bringing together companies from other economies , researchers in our tertiary institutions and local enterprises with scientific and technological competence , the science park will provide a major impetus for the development of indigenous science and technology-based companies in Hong Kong , " he said , adding that it would also promote technology transfer by attracting overseas investment and enhance regional co-operation in this area .  
This is because we have already found a right road of development suited to China 's national conditions , secured a stable social and political situation , acquired quite a solid material and technological base , and possessed a large market and rich resources , and finally we have 1.2 billion industrious and talented people .  
Proceeding from their actual situation at home and in light of their needs and possibilities , the developing countries should work out effective domestic policies and actively conduct economic restructuring in response to shifting economic and technological trends in the world .  
" China 's technological development dated back to early history , " Mr Tung said .  " Its extensiveness and far-reaching influences are unrivalled , " he said .  Mr Tung believed that this exhibition provided a splendid opportunity for the people of Hong Kong to have a better understanding of the scientific and technological achievements , as well as the diligence , wisdom and creativity of the great scientists and fine craftsmen of ancient China .  
The proposed Film Development Fund would promote innovation by supporting projects aimed at enhancing the industry 's professional and technological capabilities ; stimulating the growth of creative productions ; facilitating the use of advanced special effects techniques ; and improving the skills of employees .  
In addition , the Government will establish an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to provide " mid-stream " research , which is pivotal in linking basic scientific research to its commercial applications ; set up a $ 5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading in the manufacturing and service industries ; establish a $ 5 billion Quality Education Fund for grants to raise school standards through innovation ; and facilitate technology collaboration between academic institutions and the business community .  
These included Japan 's economic recovery packages , financial and corporate sector restructuring , providing a catalyst for private capital flows , economic and technical co-operation , electronic commerce and ways to strengthen human resource development , economic infrastructure and the science and technological base .  
With continued globalisation , infrastructure development will have to be geared towards international economic activities .  Such projects will need to be developed in anticipation of long-term demand to provide the necessary support for sustained growth , as well as the tremendous technological change we expect in the new millennium .  
To strengthen the capability of our private sector in developing innovative ideas for commercial use , I have accepted two key recommendations of the Commission on Innovation and Technology . Firstly , the establishment of an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to support and stimulate mid-stream research .  Secondly , the setting up of an Innovation and Technology Fund of HK $ 5 billion to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading of our manufacturing and service industries .  
This common law rule , which forbids the conviction of a person for homicide if the victim does not die within a year-and-a-day after receiving injury , is now considered to be inappropriate , unnecessary and undesirable , in light of the medical and technological advances in treatment and life support made since the rule was first established . 
I am confident that Hong Kong will remain a most vibrant international city in the 21st century , with advance technological development and a versatile , resilient workforce .  Like this MTR train , we will forge our way ahead with speed and vigour ; and like the Dragon , we will maintain our agility and drive to capture new opportunities that emerge in the new millennium .  Thank you .  
In the ensuing decades , based on the system laid down by the United Nations ( UN ) Economic and Social Council 's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , international codes have been developed and published .  These codes have been revised regularly to catch up with the technological developments and requirements of global trade .  
I am confident that with an active financial market , a thriving tourist industry , enhanced foreign trade , the gathering momentum of technological developments as well as the momentous development of China 's forthcoming accession to the World Trade Organisation , we can be cautiously optimistic about the medium and long-term economic prospects of Hong Kong .  
The vigorous economic growth of China , the successful launch of the " Shenzhou " spacecraft and the initialling of the Sino-American agreement on China 's accession to WTO all reflected very favourably on the growing stature of the country , the progress it has been making in technological developments as well as its rising status in the international arena .  
The people of Hong Kong have always strived for self-improvement .  We attach great importance to education , respect the elderly , care for the children , and are always ready to help in a worthy cause .  These qualities are often displayed in various aspects of our community .  Our international outlook and prompt response to new technological and scientific advances are the major factors of Hong Kong 's continued success .

The Programme helps enhance the students ' self-understanding and develop their leadership .  The students also learn to care about and understand the changes taking place at the social , economic , cultural and technological fronts .  Besides , the " Mentorship Programme " offers a precious opportunity for the students to learn from the experience of their outstanding alumni .  In addition , the special topic research group strengthens the students ' understanding of our country and enhances their analytical and problem-solving abilities .  
In the ensuing decades , based on the system laid down by the United Nations ( UN ) Economic and Social Council 's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods , international codes have been developed and published .  These codes have been revised regularly to catch up with the technological developments and requirements of global trade .  
Six categories of S &amp; amp ; T statistics , which followed closely the recommendation of the OECD and with particular reference to the specific circumstances in Hong Kong , would be compiled .  They were statistics on ( i ) research and development inputs ; ( ii ) S &amp; amp ; T human resources ; ( iii ) patents ; ( iv ) external technology flows ; ( v ) S &amp; amp ; T publications ; ad ( vi ) technological innovation .  
As for promoting technological entrepreneurship , the Small Entrepreneurship Research Assistance Programme under the ITF provides pre-venture capital funding on a matching basis to small , technology-based and entrepreneurship driven companies to undertake projects with innovative and technology content , thereby increasing their chance of successful development of new products , new processes or new services .  
The LCSD has been committed to providing quality leisure and cultural services for the public since its establishment on January 1 this year .  In view of the rapid technological development and growing popularity of the use of electronic money these days , the Department has actively studied the use of electronic money for payment of fees to provide greater convenience to the public in using our recreational and sports facilities .  
( a ) actively formulating a policy on the development of renewable energy resources , and making use of Hong Kong 's advantages on various fronts , including its natural environment , availability of the relevant scientific and technological research talents , free flow of information , advanced communication equipment , sound financing services and close co-operation with the Mainland in scientific and technological research and development , so that Hong Kong will become a leader rather than just a follower in the development and utilization of renewable energy resources ; and  
Hong Kong is developing into a major regional hub of electronic commerce , with liberalized and well-established telecommunications infrastructure , a culture embracing information technology and new innovations , close relationship with the Mainland , and successful cooperation between the public and private sector in driving infrastructural and technological developments .  
" They have brought their enormous creativity into full play , centering around optimization of living space and building efficiency , integration of technological and environmental concepts , and harmonization with physical environment , " Dr Cheng said , adding that the innovative ideas had rightly set a new direction for public housing development and were extremely valuable for future reference .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
The blueprint has already been drawn for the development in the next five years .  According to the program , continued efforts will be made to promote economic growth and social progress , with development as the main theme , restructuring the key link , reform , opening-up and technological advancement the driving force , and higher living standards the ultimate goal .  
In this era of innovation and technology , both the government and the public have recognized that the advancement of scientific and technological knowledge and its practical application are key factors in economic growth and social progress .  
At the Meeting , Ministers acknowledged the importance of helping SMEs enhance technological innovation through co-operation , and sharing of information and resources ; access finance through enhancing SMEs ' financial transparency and identifying new financing channels ; and creating a favourable business environment conducive to starting and developing businesses .  
" The Science and Technology subject is an initiative to provide students with a broad and balanced curriculum .  It is particularly valuable to non-science students , providing them with additional learning experiences on modern scientific and technological developments , " he explained .  
It has been reported that as electronic and innovative technological toys have been considered by most toy manufacturers to be the mainstream orders in the coming three years , the Toys Manufacturers ' Association of Hong Kong proposes that the Government set up an " Innovative Toy Design Centre " to upgrade the quality of local toy products .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
We will focus on the development of these niches .  Harnessing our sophisticated infrastructure , robust legal system and intellectual property protection framework , established international business experience and network , and a thriving capital market with high capital raising capability , we will continue to promote the industrialization of research findings and create an enabling environment for further technological advancement .  
" Due to our ageing population , rapid technological advances and increasing community aspiration , our public health care system is suffering from an intensive financial pressure as the cost to maintain it has been increasing swiftly and there is concern on whether the system 's long-term financial sustainability can be maintained . 
Given the department 's proven ability to adapt and manage changes , a good technological base , and highly motivated and hardworking staff in the office , Mr Jones is confident that the CR could achieve its vision by establishing , by early 2005 , a fully computerized " world-class " Companies Registry which provides a significantly enhanced level of facilities and services , both quantitatively and qualitatively , to its customers .  
Accordingly , we started an internal review in 2001 and , in the light of operating experience , international e-business development and technological advancement , drew up a set of preliminary proposals for public consultation in early 2002 .  
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
The National Science Council , under the Executive Yuan , has established a " Scientific and Technological Information Center " in Taipei , to meet the needs of national economic construction and to serve better the industrial and academic worlds . The main tasks of the center include providing information service , collection of documents , coordination and communication and technological evaluation .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
Doctors rarely engage in basic research work , it was pointed out . Furthermore , while there is a great deal of advanced technological equipment , there is a lack of people qualified to use it . The Republic of China 's standing in medical organizations was threatened a few years ago by political factors .  
It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair . Many companies feel they are the victims says one official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , but the real damage is done to the country as a whole . The goal of economic upgrading and technological progress will be thwarted if this belief persists .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
To each his strengths : Before economic reforms were implemented on the mainland , emphasis was placed on " standing on one 's own feet . " Hence , scientists were cut off from information about foreign technology and were forced to grope around in the dark . Yet in this way we gained some technological development experience , especially in a few specialized areas .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
While warfare provided partial impetus for the invention of ingenious new weaponry , " the emergence of the wooden ox was no historical accident , " asserts Wang Jian , conveying his enthusiasm for the history of Chinese mechanical science . " It was just one among a series of technological inventions . " During the Spring and Autumn period the brilliant craftsman Lu Ban created an unusual carriage for his mother , driven by a wooden figure .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Following technological advances in the fishing industry , the worldwide consumption of seafood rose and then peaked at 100 million tons in 1990 . The UN 's Food and Agriculture Organization has stated that one-fourth of the sea creatures that constitute the world 's top 20 sources of seafood are already suffering from severe overfishing , requiring cuts in total yearly hauls of 30% .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
From the 1950s , after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan , Li served in such posts as chairman of the Industrial Development Commission , economic affairs minister and minister of finance , charting Taiwan 's economic , financial and technological development policies with bold vision . His emphasis on creating a favorable investment environment and cultivating new talent brought to Taiwan an unending flow of development projects , and earned him respect as Taiwan 's " Father of Technological Development " and " Architect of the Economic Miracle . "  
Over the past 50 years , no other individual has been appointed to ministerial posts overseeing all three areas of economic , financial and technological development affairs . During his long tenure guiding economic and financial policy , he nearly single-handedly planted the seeds for the development of Taiwan 's information industry .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers . " Technological developments in Taiwan 's agriculture have never ceased to move forward , " says Lee . With its myriad technological breakthroughs , agricultural testing institutions , experimental farms , fishery testing institutions , and private enterprises , Taiwan is one of the best in the research and development of new agricultural strains .  
It 's not a listed company and its founders are n't well known members of Taiwan 's technological aristocracy . Nevertheless , it has won the Ministry of Economic Affair 's " Symbol of Excellence Award " for seven years running by pursuing its own strategy of integrating the up - , mid - , and downstream segments of the sensor industry and establishing a firm market base .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .

Peng , vice chairperson of the Chinese National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , said China and Norway have witnessed growing cooperation in economic , cultural , scientific and technological and environmental protection affairs since the forging of their diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago  
due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
As for science and education in construction , China has achieved 124 scientific and technological research results , which are up to advanced international level And a total of nearly 480,000 personnel have received education in the construction departments of various colleges and schools nationwide  
In his written statement upon arrival at Jakarta Airport , Wang Hanbin expressed his satisfaction over the development of bilateral relations , especially the exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the economic , scientific , technological and cultural fields since the resumption of diplomatic ties seven years ago  
Ma also expressed sincere solicitude to the relatives of the deceased , saying that Pfrang Jurgen Hermann was highly appreciated by relevant Chinese departments because of his positive efforts and major contributions to Sino German economic and technological cooperation over the years  
he added that local border trade with the former soviet union also developed rapidly last year , the province achieved 1-07-billion swiss francs in border trade with the former soviet union , a 48 percent increased over 1990 in addition , the province 's economic and technological cooperation and labor export increased by a big margin  
However , it was observed that developing countries were facing exceptional difficulties in reaching compatible levels of technological development , without which effective and widespread regional science and technology cooperation could not occur .  
In order to achieve the required level of services , enhanced coordination and technological innovation were indispensable , but equally essential was the provision of adequate human and material resources .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
These may be times of vertiginous political and technological change , but we sometimes feel discouraged at the persistence of tenacious negative aspects of the human condition rooted in selfishness and in the darkest chapters of our history .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
In a growing number of countries , the private sector has or is fast developing the financial , managerial and technological capacity to carry out a vast array of such activities in an effective and costefficient manner .  
As emphasized particularly by industrial organization explanations of FDI , TNCs generally enjoy specific competitive advantages based on their superior proprietary technological and organizational capacities .  
A decentralized , regionbyregion approach to international cooperation in pursuing science and technology for sustainable development is sometimes warranted by regional differences in local conditions and patterns of economic and technological activities .  
However , it was pointed out that as a result of the increased demand for " cartographic products " , governmentfunded national surveys had a bright future , subject to good leadership , adaptation to technological advances and increased financial selfreliance .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
In yet another move to keep pace with the latest technological developments , the Department will make the time-consuming process of audio / visual editing as simple as word processing and will develop a future tapeless archival system that is fully networked and capable of almost instantaneous delivery of the Department 's products world wide .  
At the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium , in a world characterized by a globalization of the economy and the dynamics of international relations , our reality is conditioned by factors such as the substantial progress of science , the transcendence of the technological revolution , the decisive influence of communications and information , the expansion of trade and the consequences of cultural and religious interaction .  
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
As rightly observed and recognized , young people in all countries are both a major human resource for development and key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .  
Ukraine considers that one of the possible ways to obtain an objective analysis of and to solve the problems connected with the Chernobyl accident would be to set up an international technological research centre which would deal with issues related to the elimination of the consequences of nuclear radiological accidents and in whose work leading experts from various countries in the world could participate .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
In this context , our delegation notes with satisfaction the significant activity of major donor countries and of the international financial organizations , primarily the World Bank , to provide scientific , expert and technological assistance to the Palestinian people to tackle tasks related to the need to improve their social and economic conditions rapidly , strengthen institutions of self-government , establish a financial and banking system , and train highly qualified national personnel .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on environmental and developmental ethics , in order to develop a common value framework between the scientific and technological community and society as a whole , and promote continuous dialogue ;  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
Criticisms of the concept of carrying capacity have pointed out that it does not adequately account for the potential impact of technological change , aspirations for higher standards of living , possibilities for and effects of international trade , and institutional , social , economic and political constraints on land use and production . 
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
Encouraging the production of relevant studies / research to assess the consequences of global and technological changes on social integration and the production of evaluations of the policies and programmes put in place to achieve the various components of social integration ; and encouraging national and international exchanges and dissemination of information on innovative models and successful practices ;  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such technical advisory panel ( s ) as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
Future decision-makers must be trained to take an interdisciplinary approach that spans the environmental , social , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological advance .  
This is based on the need to train future decision-makers to take an interdisciplinary approach to the promotion of technology by evaluating the environmental , sociological , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological innovation and implementation .  
Poverty is a multidimensional , complex situation that has economic , educational , social , political , cultural and technological dimensions .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
Major constraints being experienced by the countries include , in particular , a drastic decline in financial resources to adequately maintain the various valuable scientific and technological infrastructures and , of increasing concern , the critical reduction in the scientific workforce in bioscience and biotechnology .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
Efforts will also be directed to incorporating the secretariat into a regional network linking the main national research centres on industrial restructuring and competitiveness to conduct comparative and overall analyses on the experiences in designing industrial and technological development strategies .  
The resource growth is attributable to ( a ) acquisition of the specialized automation equipment required for development of local area network in the Department under the responsibility of the Information Support Unit ( $ 55,000 ) , and ( b ) additional requirements for replacement of existing equipment of the Department under the global programme of technological innovations ( $ 113,900 ) .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
The main objectives of the association are to further economic integration , develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea and strengthen functional cooperation in the political , cultural , scientific , social and technological areas .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
The unique character of the Congress , in which the participants combined political leverage and expertise , and which served as a forum for the world-wide sharing of knowledge , exchange of experience and transfer of technological know-how , has been widely recognized , and its productive results were emphasized both at the Congress and at the Commission 's subsequent session . 
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;  
Croatia 's views stem from its geo-strategic position and its political , economic , technological and cultural features , and are thus closely linked to its long-term strategic interests , including a political settlement to the crisis in the region as a precondition for democratic and independent development .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
Achieving technological dynamism is therefore a major objective and challenge facing all countries .  To this end , parallel to individual country efforts , inter-country or cross-country initiatives are taking shape in the interest of efficiency and dynamic complementarities that achieve economies of scale and broaden the scope of innovative activities , particularly where the critical level of resources is not readily available .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
On a strategic and policy level , the Union 's supreme organ , the Plenipotentiary Conference , meeting at Kyoto in October 1994 , set out its strategic plan for 1995-1999 in resolution 1 of which it considers the subject in the context of the rapidly changing telecommunication environment under three broad headings : restructuring of the telecommunication sector , technological convergence , and globalization .  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
There is much potential for further sweeping changes and geographical shifts in the loci of production , as the developing countries adapt to technological advances , especially large countries with a latent export potential , and as the economies in transition begin to expand , especially those situated in proximity to major world markets .  
Within the framework of ECLAC / UNDP regional project RLA / 88 / 039 , entitled " Design of policies to strengthen the capacity for technological innovation and enhance international competitiveness in the Latin American entrepreneurial environment " , ECLAC and SELA officials held meetings to analyse the possibilities for cooperation in identifying and describing the current status of industrial policy in various countries in the region .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
It is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .  
NULLIt is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .  
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
NULLIn the light of those findings , the Working Group , in its general conclusions , confirmed that efforts towards promoting technology transfer and technological capability-building in developing countries and countries in transition need to be coupled with market-based trade and investment policy and pricing systems , and with a stable macroeconomic environment for business activity conducive to overall economic growth and employment . 
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
In parallel , UNIDO is preparing a manual for self-diagnosis of critical technological needs for sustained competitiveness at the plant level , the core of which could be applied to all developing countries .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
There is danger that , due to scientific / technological backwardness , the Federal Republic may experience a period of " ecologic blockade " after the sanctions are lifted , because its economy will not be ready to meet the demands of the markets of developed countries who are the Republic 's main trade partners .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
At the time of this reorganization , the head of the First Group had expressed his conviction that , although considerable promise of success was evident in the production of diffusion barriers , the technological content of the entire gaseous diffusion process was likely to be beyond Iraq 's short-term capabilities and had suggested that the gas centrifuge enrichment process was worthy of attention .  
stressed the need for strengthened international cooperation which should be reflected in appropriate financial and technological resources to enable developing countries to implement their national plans .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
This reorganization of the international system on the basis of strategic economic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific and technological revolution , a revolution of knowledge that spread across the planet and brought about the most profound change ever experienced in the history of humankind , turning the world into one large neighbourhood .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network ( comprising telecommunications and television , the Mir manned orbital station , space research and technological development , navigational safety , tracking of vessels in distress , topographic geodesy and cartography , and remote sensing of the Earth ) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability , further developing science and technology , improving the country 's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Although there was a growing interest in mobile communications , their development would depend on the evolution of important factors , such as technological progress , the availability of orbital positions ( for geostationary satellites ) , spectral bandwidths , costs and performance to satisfy a wide range of applications and the capability to provide truly global services .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
Parties to the Protocol on Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) , not yet in force , are also expected , as a second step , to negotiate further measures to reduce VOC emissions or their transboundary fluxes and their resulting secondary photochemical oxidant products , taking into account , inter alia , the best available scientific and technological developments , scientifically determined critical levels and internationally accepted target levels , as well as the role of nitrogen oxides in the formation of photochemical oxidants .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .  
Concerning the definition of an aerospace object , while we agree generally with question 1 , which considers the twofold capacity to travel and to fly into orbit as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object , we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology , and therefore we advise , in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution , to thoroughly examine the aerospace object requisites . 
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
Conduct research on the effects of the internationalization and globalization of economies , including technological change , on men 's and women 's employment , including changing international work patterns , and publish the findings for use in policy formulation and advocacy ; continue research on occupational segregation and on unequal pay for men and women ; assess the gender dimension of structural adjustment through country studies ; document the impact of policy reforms on women , based on household surveys ; conduct case-studies on the role and contribution of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .  
Finally , a sixth objective is to respond to the expressed need of the international community for the annual consideration , review and evaluation of continuing developments related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs in the General Assembly through the monitoring and analysis of and reporting on developments relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs , including legal , political , economic , technological and scientific developments .  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
To ensure that the proper mix of permanent , temporary and contractual staff and adequate technological resources are available so that documentation produced in all six official languages is of high quality and is issued in a timely fashion , in strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the various bodies and organs of the United Nations ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Industry remains a vital instrument for economic and social progress , facilitating employment generation , contributing fundamentally to productivity growth and technological change , enabling the creation of dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors , and contributing to foreign-exchange earnings .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
The commonly accepted definition of a standard is the result of well-reasoned collective choice designed to serve as the basis of understanding for the solution of recurring problems ; a standard represents a balance between the requirements of users and workers and between the technological and social possibilities of these two groups and the public interest which the authorities must safeguard .  
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) role and implications of macroeconomic policies for promotion of regional economic cooperation ; ( viii ) one issue on new and innovative ways to develop and strengthen industrial and technological skills : and ( x ) one issue on technology indicators and directories of selected research and development institutions , experts and technologies .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
To achieve its goals in this area , UNCTAD uses to its maximum extent the leverage of the information technology paradox : contrary to previous technological revolutions , which have largely concentrated economic power and competitiveness in a handful of capital-rich and technology-intensive national economies , the information revolution has made strategic technologies and information much more affordable , even for the smaller players . 
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;

In this regard , I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian people can count on the support of Ukraine which , with its considerable scientific and technological potential , stands ready to develop dynamic Ukrainian-Palestinian cooperation in the economic sphere , in particular in the sectors of housing and capital construction , water supply , education and training . 
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
The Trade and Development Report had gone beyond the traditional argument put forward by the World Bank in various respects : first , by emphasizing the need to establish a dynamic interaction between exports and investment ; secondly , by showing the importance of mobilizing and making full use of natural resources and abundant , unskilled labour and of continuously upgrading industries and moving up the technological ladder ; and thirdly , by pointing to the challenges for government policies involving new forms of intervention to support a dynamic process of development .  
Among other things , the committee is endeavouring to lay down the main principles for reconciling technological progress in these fields with ethical and legal standards , human values , human rights and social , economic and cultural realities .  
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies , financial and other resources and an enabling environment .  
Despite the economic and technological difficulties it faced , Colombia had introduced sweeping legislative , institutional and administrative reforms for environmental protection .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
This involves improving competitiveness in telecommunications , continuing with the technological development of Earth observation , developing advanced scientific instrumentation , carrying out work in orbital infrastructures and acquiring techniques for future launchers .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
At its fifty _ third session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1997 / 71 , entitled Human rights and bioethics , requested the Sub _ Commission , under the agenda item Human rights and scientific and technological developments , to consider ways of ensuring that the life sciences develop in a manner respectful of human rights and beneficial to humanity as a whole and to make recommendations to that effect .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The Conference has been recognized as a forum for technical cooperation , technology transfer and programme coordination for the countries of the Americas region , providing government officials , planners , scientists and experts from the Americas and elsewhere with an opportunity to address common needs , problems and experiences in the field of surveying and mapping , cartography , hydrography , remote sensing , and land and geographical information systems , including educational and training aspects , scientific and technological requirements , implementation issues and benefits . 
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
The Parties shall promote the maintenance and development , on a mutually advantageous basis , of productive and scientific and technological cooperation between economic agents , particularly in the development and production of modern goods employing advanced technology , including items for defence needs , through , inter alia , the formulation of comprehensive inter-State and intersectoral cooperation programmes .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
However , these improvements would remain transitory and frail unless accompanied by policies at both the national and the international levels favourable to strong institutional and technological capacity-building .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
With regard to migration , that extremely complex phenomenon was linked to many demographic , social , ecological , psychological , historical and technological factors .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
The secretariat convened five international expert working groups to study aspects of early-warning as they relate to geological hazards , hydrometeorlogical hazards including drought , technological hazards , the use and transfer of modern technology , and national and local capabilities pertinent to early-warning .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
We are seeking to build a modern society capable of accompanying the world on its march forward and of assimilating scientific and technological information ; a society aware of the challenges of our time and working to meet those challenges .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Takes note of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ;  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
A solid legal and contractual basis is being established for Russian-Ukrainian interaction in the political , economic , scientific and technological and humanitarian fields .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
COPUOS should play a greater role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , strengthening the international legal order in space , stimulating scientific and technological progress in the developing countries and helping them to share in the spin-off benefits of space technology .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the full , open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific , technological , technical , socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change , and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies , including through the establishment of relevant mechanisms for this purpose in the subsidiary bodies of the Convention .  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
He said that an understanding of the basic underlying technology of the Internet was essential , as the technological limitations and the possibilities of the Internet shaped potential public policy options .  
The overall technological capabilities required to develop in the ultraviolet domain an orbital telescope 2 metres in size , with image quality in the range of 0.5 arcsec , could be envisioned as a project of limited costs ;  
The project focuses on the nature of the private investment decisions of southern European manufacturing firms required to incorporate technological change in the transition to sustained and competitive growth in the single European market .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
Developing the capability to understand and predict the social and economic impact of existing practices ( technological , social , economic and cultural ) that might be detrimental to future generations and national economic / social systems ;  
Natural hazards have thus been defined as extreme geophysical events , biological processes and major technological accidents , characterized by concentrated releases of energy or materials that pose a largely unexpected threat to humans .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
With the combined technological advances in molecular biology and rapid sequence reading by computers , scientists are able to identify unique genetic data in human DNA from the collection of hair , blood , tissue , mucous membrane and saliva samples .  
The Board recognized the threat posed by rapid technological innovation in future warfare and was keen on pursuing some of the consequent policy implications for the United Nations system .  
A comprehensive , integrated yet flexible approach is required in order to explore the developmental opportunities of ageing , as they combine with the technological and cultural transitions of our time .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
Member States in eastern Europe should be encouraged to actively cooperate and participate in the international scientific and technological research programmes on the International Space Station , as their involvement could provide major economic and social benefits for the region .  
Under this Act , the State supports international scientific and technological cooperation , creates legal and economic conditions for it and fosters scientific and technological activities carried out on free and equal terms with international scientific associations , provided such terms do not contravene national law . 
Small businesses had the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and scientific and technological expertise and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and economic and social development .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
During the biennium 20002001 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In this connection , UNIDO has combined its unique technical and sectoral expertise with technical cooperation provided by other multilateral and bilateral agencies to enhance technological upgrading of industry and facilitate the adoption of production processes consistent with new global standards for quality , cleaner production and energy efficiency in small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) .  
This will reinforce existing South / South networks and create opportunities for experts to learn from rapid substantive and technological changes in the field of statistics ; strengthen regional capability to produce analytical reports ; improve the ability of national institutions to produce relevant statistics ; and ensure capability to share information and results .  
In reviewing items 8 ( a ) - ( c ) , special attention will be paid to the scientific and technological developments that have taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular developing countries , with regard to global , regional and national issues .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
In many developing countries , low levels of technological accumulation point to a need for an overhaul of the educational system in order to incorporate basic technical and business education which will serve as a basis for either on-the-job training by firms or formal industry-wide education .  
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .  
This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
In late 1998 , the firm Veng S.A . was set up with the aim of developing new-generation space vehicles through unconventional mechanisms of financing by the private sector and scientific and technological bodies .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
In the field of natural gas , two projects technological and ecological norms , required for the design and operation of the gas distribution networks , and existing standards and regulations on permissible concentrations of harmful components in gaseous fuels and gaseous fuels combustion products have been launched .  
Countries today , especially developing countries , need to be capable of assimilating technological progress through an understanding of the present and its projection into the future , by formulating appropriate strategies to close the technology gap with the more advanced nations and thus avoid being overtaken by events .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
Mexico thus considers that the promotion of knowledge of outer space and its technological applications should be encouraged both nationally and internationally , as part of the cultural heritage of present and future generations , fostering a comprehensive and integrated vision of the environment and a greater awareness of the potential uses of this resource and the need to preserve it .  
In order to prepare the country technologically for the expected information explosion of the twenty-first century , South Africa will align its regulatory framework to make use of all the technological advantages offered by wireless local loop and by fixed and mobile satellite services .  
A primary output of the follow-up to the Potsdam conference will be a specific action plan and guidelines towards an integrated process approach , interdisciplinary and multisectoral , thereby comprising sociological , economical , political , organizational , scientific and technological components .  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
We shall adopt and implement policy measures at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels aimed at reducing the vulnerability of our societies to both natural and technological hazards through proactive rather than reactive approaches .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
Special attention needs to be given to improving the understanding of the interdependence of foreign direct investment , domestic investment , technological change and technology flows , the policies and practices of multinational firms and the evolution of corporate governance .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .  
His countrys scientific and technological potential and its understanding of the need for coordination with similar activities in Western Europe made it an excellent base for the setting up of a mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of institutions in Central and Eastern Europe in formulating programmes and projects geared to achieving environmentally sustainable development .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communication , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity , for promoting racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred , as well as the collection of funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world , Having considered the report submitted by the Secretary-General7 within the framework of the implementation of the Programme of Action ,  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
In a context of economic , political and social globalization and an unprecedented technological revolution , half a century after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , it was inconceivable that some countries should be unwilling to fulfil their commitments in that connection .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The United Nations must provide some direction in the debate on the complex issues surrounding royalties for genetic material , and should help to fashion an international technological architecture that encouraged technological advances , but not at the cost of marginalizing the poorest and most vulnerable .  
In the modern world , the development of national scientific and technological capacities was essential for increasing the competitiveness of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition and ensuring their real integration into the world economic system .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Mr . Sharma ( India ) said , in reviewing the world economic situation , that in the late 1980s and early 1990s globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change had seemingly held out to humanity the promise of historic change , a promise of fresh opportunities , as the developing countries increasingly participated in the growth of the world economy , to improve living standards and secure a brighter future for millions mired in poverty and underdevelopment .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
It had been assigned the task of promoting various space-related activities in Israel , including the building of an infrastructure geared towards achieving optimal economic and commercial results by making use of the countrys technological advances in selected niches , notably in the use of small satellites and remote sensing .  
Central imperative planning based on physical targets , that allowed fast initial structural change , soon came to be viewed as engendering critical rigidities and obstacles to endogenous technological and organizational change .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
From the judicial perspective of The Hague , the century that is about to close is a century of great achievement and profound loss , of extraordinary scientific and technological advance and of atavistic reversion to barbarism .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
This aspect of the struggle to eradicate the scourge of anti-personnel mines deserves our attention for two major reasons : technological progress , which is the indispensable key to decisive progress in the field regarding weapons disseminated in huge numbers over vast areas , in 60 countries ; and promising scientific progress which we see today here and there .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts will certainly be of great practical importance , ensuring the speedy rescue of astronauts in case of breakdowns , accidents or forced landings , for , as scientific and technological advance continues , manned space flights will become longer and more complex every year . . . .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
The interdependence in which SMEs were supposed to live was fraught with increased complexity and risks of instability and marginalization.For many African SMEs , the opportunities created by technological advances , the increased mobility of production factors and regional trading arrangements were either still nominal or not fully accessible . 
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
Scientific and technological breakthroughs , growing interdependence , impressive development of standards of behaviour at the international level , and the emergence of a global consensus to prevent war and curb the perils of armaments and , particularly , weapons of mass destruction are indeed significant achievements of the twentieth century .  
The guidelines also lay emphasis on a number of principles , including the principle that effective verification can be undertaken without necessarily compromising national secrets , that it is important to protect sensitive national installations and information , that care should be taken to prevent the abuse of verification , and that the economic , technological and social development of States should not be jeopardized .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .  
In its resolution 37-90 of 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly decided that , in accordance with the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , 1 the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be directed towards , among other things , stimulating the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in developing countries .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
Here is a country relatively small in size , but in terms of social , economic , financial , cultural , technological and scientific achievements , the Republic of China on Taiwan is indeed a force to be reckoned with , a formidable powerhouse .  
It should be emphasized that such cooperative activities implemented through effective programmes would contribute significantly to improving the scientific , technological and regulatory capabilities of the developing countries .  
This global agenda is not restrictive , and can be achieved through the political , cultural , educational , social , economic , information and even technological domains .  
It is inspired by a vision of the enormous potential for human development created by the end of the cold war , the accelerated pace of technological development and the deepening interdependence of nations .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
The phenomenal technological advances of the twentieth century had brought about strong industrial growth in the developed world but had left the developing countries far behind .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
There is a consensus that without democratic and topquality education it is impossible to the secure economic , social , scientific , technological , cultural or political changes to which the Panamanian State and society aspire .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
That would create an excellent opportunity for promoting dialogue directed towards the formulation of a general , comprehensive set of rules for combating terrorism on the political , economic , technological and legal fronts .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
In the current environment of intensifying globalization , rapid technological advance and a knowledgeintensive economy , creative and innovative activity plays a key role in all aspects of development . 
On the technological level , new weapons research and development has continued unabated , with the emergence of more accurate nuclear ballistic missile systems and the deployment of highly accurate nuclear armed cruise missiles .  
A challenge to the established order , which may sometimes be painful , is to be expected when scientific and technological progress brings about sudden and profound changes in human societies .  
Although scientific and technological progress is being made and material wealth is being accumulated , technological symposiums and other activities reaching broad sectors of the population are needed if the desired level of development is to be attained .  
But its main task was to promote technical cooperation and implement integrated programmes , always bearing in mind the current technological revolution and the profound changes taking place in industrial organizations , especially transnational corporations .  
Liberalization is not possible in LDCs since indigenous human and technological capacities have to be developed first , supported by the gradual removal of protectionist measures and progressive application of international standards .  
It was stated that , in Argentina , at the universities in Crdoba and Neuqun , privately supported projects involving small and inexpensive satellites devoted to scientific and technological experiments were being undertaken as an effective means of promoting good education in space engineering and technology and of attracting talented young people to the subject .  
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
For ethical and practical reasons , the vicious circle of poverty and lack of access to modern technological resources must be broken , and a virtuous circle established in which such technology made it possible to achieve better standards of living .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
Since it could be argued that , with better visual information , the health impact perhaps would have been less significant , a major recommendation derived from the first experiment was that , in future experiments , technological solutions had to be sought that might bring the physical environment of remote interpretation as close as possible to normal on-site conditions .  
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
In 43 countries , integrated programmes address poverty alleviation through industrial development by improving industrial governance and institutional infrastructure , strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises , upgrading technological capacities , skills and access to modern technology , export and trade capabilities , and adopting energy efficient and cleaner productive measures .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
In this context , the importance of access to scientific and technological information and databases and the threat posed by the ongoing privatization and commodification of such information on the one hand , and of stimulating local innovation without creating exclusive property rights on the other , was stressed .  
In particular , Parties have raised specific concerns regarding : ( i ) the competence of participants in the CST , ( ii ) the political nature of discussions within the CST , rather than a focus on scientific and technological issues , ( iii ) the lack of continuity of representatives to the CST , and ( iv ) inadequate time within the agenda of the CST to allow for in-depth analysis and debate of the issues .  
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
The options for determining the level and timing of emissions reductions and limitations include international agreement on emissions and / or concentration levels and on how the effort will be equitably shared , programmes for technological development , national policies to affect the energy mix and associated investments , market-based and regulatory policy instruments , and voluntary action .  
The problems created by globalization could provoke a genuine crisis of confidence among the worlds people as they saw poverty worsening , income unequally distributed within and among countries and international financial and commercial markets prey to instability at a time when the international community had never had such economic and technological means at its disposal .  
Success in the fight against transnational organized crime depended largely on the ability of States to achieve equitable growth , integrate themselves into the global economy in a manner consistent with their economic and social policy objectives and ensure that their populations benefited equitably from new opportunities for empowerment and technological advancement .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
The interlinkages between international migration and development were complex in the sense that they brought into play a multiplicity of factors economic , technological , demographic , social , ecological , historical and cultural depending on regional characteristics .  
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
After the shock and sincere sorrow felt by all peoples throughout the world for the atrocious and insane terrorist attack against the people of the United States , the most extremist ideologues and most belligerent hawks , already established in their privileged positions of power , have taken command of the most powerful country in the world , whose military and technological capabilities seem infinite .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and complexity and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Stresses the importance of facilitating access to and transfer of knowledge and technology on concessional , preferential and favourable terms to the developing countries , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights and the special needs of developing countries , with the objective of enhancing their technological capacities , capabilities , productivity and competitiveness in the world market ;  
Recognize that scientific research , technological innovation , and new information and communications technologies can be instrumental in the formulation of economic , social and environmental policies , and should therefore be promoted and facilitated through regional and international cooperation .  
To develop local , national and regional capacities through a lasting strategic alliance among all development actors so that advantage can be taken at the local level of the potential of globalization through an exchange of experiences and best practices within and between countries , the promotion of formal and informal education for national and local leaders , and support for applied research and technological innovation at all levels .

A significant response to this challenge has emerged from various global and regional programmes of environmental research , assessments and capacity-building mainly sponsored by the international organizations that make up the scientific and technological community , including the worlds scientific academies and professional bodies and independent networks of scholars , scientists and engineers .  
Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .  
Participants in the World Conference of Scientific Academies , Tokyo , process are encouraged to examine these documents , as they provide a very valuable and detailed picture of the scientific and technological communitys views and commitments on a wide range of issues critical to sustainable development .  
The scientific and technological community is convinced that there is already a very wide range of relevant , accessible and often inexpensive technologies and processes available to meet the basic needs of the poor and socially excluded .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Over the next five years , the scientific and technological community is committed to significantly enhancing the active participation of scientists and engineers within : national sustainable development commissions ; all levels of government , as advisers to heads of State , heads of international agencies , parliaments etc . ; and private sector boards of directors . 
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
The review shall be open and transparent , inclusive , flexible and facilitative , as well as effective in terms of the use of financial , technological and human resources .  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
This has been achieved by making the relevant amendments to the Access to space action area by the appropriate means and mechanisms , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by Argentina in that connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
Space activities in Ukraine in the year 2000 were directed at meeting the countrys obligations under international programmes and projects , implementing the priority projects of the national space programme for 1998 to 2002 , improving the effectiveness of the work of the national space sector through restructuring and marketing , introducing advanced space technologies to an increasing extent , enhancing competitiveness and the conditions for private initiative , and collaborating with international financial , scientific , technological and other organizations on a large scale .

Through financial , technical and / or other assistance , supporting LDCs efforts to achieve levels of investment in infrastructure for education and training that are consistent with building local technological capabilities , including through innovative private partnerships ;  
Strengthening the institutional and technological capacity to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development by increasing the ability of policy makers to formulate and implement relevant legislation and environmental management plans ;  
Developed countries and international institutions should provide increasing support , especially in terms of resources for technical assistance in capacity-building , to developing countries and those in economic transition that strive to simplify tax laws and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration and enhance enforcement through the strengthening of institutional , technical and technological capacities , including the development of a transparent , accountable and corruption-free system ;  
98% of enterprises in Jiangsu Province are small and medium sized with a relatively weak capability for proprietary technological innovation .  They are also restricted by various factors such as their management expertise and composition of talent .  Their current competitive edge mainly relies on the advantage of imported equipment from abroad and cheap cost of labor .  
The expert evaluation panel , including Professor Chen Huanchun from Huazhong Agricultural University who was also a member of the Academy of Engineering , said research of these key technologies had reached an advanced level domestically and some were leading the world level , which offered firm technological backing to the ecological environment as well as the social and economic development of the Three Gorges Dam area .  
In the past few years , scientific and technological achievements that have come out of researching , manufacturing and developing have mainly been new crystalline material , digital color TV with picture-in-picture function , UPS series products , bank POS systems , nationwide computer-controlled cement composite bag bagging machines , medium voltage switches , etc .  
The Anbo company is a key project in China 's nationalization of the production of color TVs , which China built up during the " seventh five-year plan " period ( 1986-1990 ) with wholesale introduction of foreign advanced technology and implementation of general technological contracts from outside .  
He said that Henan Province possessed not only the hardware required for foreign investment , but also integrated the reality of this province to formulate a preferential policy to encourage foreign investors to invest and develop foreign economic , trade and technological cooperation on the basis of national policies .  
This year , China 's economically strong province , Jiangsu Province , has further expanded opening up to the outside world and vigorously improved the investment environment , resulting in its open economy having realized overall rapid development .  Its foreign trade , utilizing foreign investment , and foreign economic and technological cooperation have all shown substantial growth .  
Bangguo Wu pointed out that China 's land-based petroleum industry achieved great success last year , and oil and gas production volume increased by 1.81-million tons and 730-million cubic meters respectively compared with the previous year ; with nearly 1-million tons of shared oil from overseas , its growth rate was the highest since the " seventh five-year plan " period ( 1986-1990 ) ; its economic benefits were considerable , turning over 25.8-billion yuan of taxes , achieving profits of 10-billion yuan ; making great achievements in scientific and technological progress .  
Additionally , the Weihai economic and technological development zone also cooperates with relevant regions in Korea , and has established so far Shandong 's largest exclusive Korean investment industrial park - the Qingnan syndicate .  At present , the Qingnan syndicate has approved 12 entering projects , with a total project investment of 73.1-million US dollars and has preliminarily formed three large industries , taking automobile and automobile parts and components processing as the focus .  
Lilan Zhu , vice-chairman of National Science and Technology Committee , said today at the fair 's opening ceremony that with China 's economic prosperity and rapid technological progress , people 's living standard continuously improving and purchasing capability continuously strengthening , China 's book import market has great potential .  
This meeting is named " the Urumchi external economy and trade negotiation meeting " , while the two previous meetings were called " Urumchi border local region negotiation meeting " .  Its merchant invitation scope extends from neighboring countries to nearly 100 countries and regions such as Europe and America , southeast Asia , western Asia , the Middle East , etc .  Negotiation content include not only barter trade , but have also added items such as cash trading , economic and technological co-operation and capital and technology introduction , etc .  
According to what was revealed in the meeting , as far as investment direction is concerned , Tianjin encourages Taiwanese investors to invest in infrastructure , base industries , funded technology concentrated industries , and high-technology projects , and to participate in the technological reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , to invest in third industry experimental projects .  Taiwanese financial capital and industrial capital institutions are welcome to come to Tianjin to build up financial organizations .  
Relying on scientific innovation and technological innovation , we have developed China 's first transistor line-relay protective device , the first digital tele-control equipment , and first digital line protective device for 32-bit computers over the past few decades .  So far we have won 198 scientific and technological achievement awards at the national , provincial , or ministry levels .  Our dominant products are among the best in the country and are up to international advanced standards .  
At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .  
These investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness .  These projects have enhanced Shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .  
We should extensively engage in cooperation and exchanges with other countries , fully capitalize on the favorable conditions stemming from our contacts with relevant organizations in foreign countries and our understanding of the latest developments abroad , and take the initiative in helping enterprises improve their production techniques , technological standards , and product quality .  
The detachment also made use of the technological advantages of colleges , and launched several special firing experiments under the guidance of college experts , including antitank missile cross-water firing , pitch angle firing , and firing in nuclear and chemical warfare .  They obtained a huge amount of first-hand information , and accumulated precious experiences .  Based on their training results , they compiled the " training outlines , " which were promulgated and implemented by the whole army .  
He spoke highly of the remarkable achievements scored by Shaanxi Province in recent years through the exploitation of its own advantages in such fields as the reform of tertiary educational management structure , the improvement in the teachers ' living conditions , the promotion of socialized logistic service in schools , and the acceleration of the transformation and industrialization of scientific and technological achievements .  He hopes that Shaanxi will display its advantages as a major province in education and science and technology to make still greater contributions to the large-scale development in West China .  
Cao Gangchuan noted : Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee , the State Council , and the Central Military Commission , China 's scientific and technological undertaking for national defense has realized a historic leap of growing out of nothing and expanding from weak to strong and from small to large ;  
Ever since the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , in particular , all the comrades working on the scientific and technological front for national defense and weaponry development have firmly implemented the strategy established by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on strengthening the army through science and technology , successfully adapted themselves to the world 's development trend of high technologies and changes in the world 's military field , gone all out to make the country strong , and have attained new achievements of world interest .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
Cao Gangchuan indicated : Such a large-span development in the scientific and technological undertaking for national defense and weaponry development has also brought along the progress of the entire country in the field of high technologies ; given a great impetus to the industrialization of such high-tech sectors as nuclear power , aviation , space flight , shipbuilding , machinery , and electronics ; and has made considerable contribution to promoting the economic construction and enhancing the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
Some domestic non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises were also quite dynamic .  " We do not set employment quotas .  No matter how many they are , all the talents will be employed , as long as they are outstanding and are needed by our corporation , " said a pertinent responsible person of Shenzhen Huawei Technology Corporation .  
He said : " China 's forthcoming accession to the WTO , a new situation , has made the outstanding professionals , middle - and high-class specialized professionals in particular , more important and popular than never before .  Meanwhile , foreign-invested enterprises and non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises are very keen in market changes and try to seize the commanding height on market with talented people .  
It is necessary to properly handle the direction and intensity of macro regulation and control , combine internal demand expansion , structural readjustment , scientific and technological progress , and opening up to the outside work , accelerate the fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic growth modes , and strive to uplift the development of the national economy to a new stage .  
9.8 billion yuan for the establishment of science and technology development fund , a knowledge innovation project , and increased investment in basic science research and key scientific and technological projects , increasing by 14.6 percent as compared with the previous year ;  
Judging from the actual needs of the current national economic growth , Xiang Huaicheng said , the proactive fiscal policy still requires the necessary policy efforts in order to achieve the goals of ultimately expanding internal demand and promoting steady economic growth and to provide guarantee for quality and efficient development in national economic restructuring and scientific and technological advancement .  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
He said : The important speech delivered by Comrade Jiang Zemin recently on educational issues was not directed at any specific chance occurrences .  It was an exposition of great foresight made in consideration of the destiny of our country , national rejuvenation , the implementation of the strategy for rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and the development of socialist modernization .  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
The provincial government offered rich rewards to outstanding scientists and technologists who made major contributions , gave better benefits to more than 40 academics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineers in Sichuan , established foundations for scientific research project leaders , set up state-level high technology and new technology zones and economic and technological development zones in Chengdu and Mianyang , and attracted a large number of experts and entrepreneurs inside and outside China to start and develop businesses .  
Qinghai is rich in petroleum , natural gas , salt , and nonferrous metal deposits , and it has special climatic conditions for the development of special agriculture and animal husbandry .  There are prospects for attaining development in a leaping-forward way [ kua yue shi de fa zhan 6421-6390-1709-4104-4099-1455 ] in a relatively short period of time , provided that we seize the opportunity , accelerate the progress of reform and opening up , enhance our concept of the market , and pay attention to the scientific and technological content in the exploitation and utilization of resources .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
NPC deputies and members of the CPPCC National Committee believed that the increasing economic and technological exchanges between various fraternal nationalities have promoted national economic development , brought about brisk markets , and improved the nation 's international competitiveness .  
With the approval of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee , the central budget was adjusted ; discount interests on state treasury bonds for increasing investment in infrastructure construction and enterprises ' technological transformation were increased ; extra budgetary revenues were used to increase wages of staff members and workers of administrative units and institutions and to increase social insurance revenues ;  
Third , the work of economic and social development in 2000 should comprehensively implement all policies and measures set forth by the central leadership ; correctly handle the relationship between reform , development , and stability ; give prominence to the proper handling of reforms and development in state-owned enterprises , the economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and expansion of domestic demand ;  
Enterprise management should be improved .  Scientific and technological factors should be enhanced .  A good job should be done in upgrading technology , updating equipment , lowering energy consumption and costs , increasing the variety of products , enhancing product quality , increasing enterprises ' competitive power , raising their economic efficiency .  
Beginning in the 14th century , Europe saw the Renaissance , broke away from the confines of theocratic power , achieved unprecedented emancipation of the mind , and produced rapid scientific and technological development .  By the 18th century , Europe achieved the industrial revolution , marked by the steam engine , and completed the transition to capitalist industrial society .  
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
4 .  Article Nine of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall organize and mobilize their members to study Marxism , Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory ( of building socialism with Chinese characteristics ) ; study current political affairs ; learn and exchange professional , scientific , and technological knowledge ; and enhance their abilities of serving the motherland .  
Deputy Huang Ju said : Our country is comparatively short of natural resources in terms of per capita quantities .  After economic development reaches a certain level , when facing the rapid scientific and technological progress in the world and the accelerating process of economic globalization , we may take the initiative in moving out of our national boundary and participate in international economic division of work and cooperation at a higher level .  
correctly handle relationships among reform , development , and stability ; place emphasis on the reform and development of state enterprises , economic restructuring , scientific and technological advancement , and the expansion of domestic demand ; and promote sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth .  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
Zeng Peiyan said : We must control population growth , protect and develop the ecological environment , and save and effectively utilize resources to truly base economic and social development on constant scientific and technological advancement , the sustained utilization of resources , an ecological balance , and a clean environment .  
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
In recent years , China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense has attained achievements of world interest , and a great headway has been registered in the development and production quality of key weapons models .  Particularly , the successful launching of satellites , the successful completion of the National Day parade , and the successful launching of the " Shenzhou " experimental spacecraft have greatly inspired the spirit of the nation , and have enhanced the prestige of our country and our army .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Our country has signed government-to-government agreements on peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 16 countries , including Britain , France , Russia , and Japan , and established economic , technological , and trade relations with more than 40 countries and regions , thus playing a positive role in promoting international cooperation in peaceful utilization of nuclear energy .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , especially since the Democratic Reform , the people of all ethnic groups on this snow plateau have been living in harmony and sharing weal and woe with one another .  They have gradually formed a socialist ethnic relationship marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance .  Reform and opening-up have increased economic and technological exchanges between the Tibetans and the people of other ethnic groups , thereby enhancing their solidarity .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
Rich in natural resources , China 's northwestern region enjoys a considerably high manufacturing and technological level , as well as a fairly strong ability in scientific research and development ; and some of the region 's products have proved fairly competitive in the international market .  All these advantages should be brought into better play through reform and readjustment .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
The one-man camouflage smoke launcher and assembled false target that they developed and improved won a third-class prize for military scientific and technological progress .  
To promote the application of patented technologies , the exhibition also displays all the patented items that won gold medals and outstanding awards in China in the past , the projects that were selected by the State Intellectual Property Office as showcases for application of patented technologies to industrial production , and some selected patented technology projects that have attained high technological standards and generated good economic returns .  
Both positive and negative experiences show : Under the same material and technological conditions , whether there is a mental force and whether the mental force is strong or weak will have a major bearing on success or failure of a person or a unit 's work .  The impact of this factor must never be underestimated .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .  
Development of command automation is not only a technological issue .  If we lack a clear understanding of tactical ideas , operations methods , the basic form of high-tech warfare , and what the future warfare will be , command automation will be developed without a clear purpose , and " advanced technology will be used to do backward work . "  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
Jiang Zemin indicated : The cooperation between our two countries has also proved satisfactory in the educational , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  Last year , in particular , China successfully held a watercolor painting exhibition and a Chinese Film Week in Greece ; while the Greek National Opera successful staged the ancient Greek tragedy " ( Maidyr ) " in Beijing , which was warmly received by the Chinese audience .  
Relying on its super economic and technological strength while possessing a huge nuclear arsenal , an individual military power has vigorously developed the national missile defense system in an attempt to seek absolute security of its own .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
On the one hand , the ideological and political construction should push forward military academies and universities to further emancipate their thinking , change their perceptions , face modernization , face the world , face the future , catch up with the world trend of scientific and technological advances , of military revolution and of educational advances , create famous brands and struggle to be first class .  
As in-depth changes in the military fields in the world are caused by the development of modern science and technology , especially high technology , the scientific and technological content of army building and modern warfare has been increased to an unprecedentedly high level .  This has put ever higher demands on the scientific and cultural qualities of our officers and men .  
The proliferation of information technology and the trend toward global economic and technological unification have further heightened the speed of technological propagation .  This has moved forward our starting point , skipping certain developmental stages , and providing innumerable opportunities for realizing generation crossing developments in military construction .  
At present , the most pressing is to cultivate a unified military and technological database to develop talent , and timely extension of investigation of military strong points and survey of large military areas , constructing precise military-use digital mapping .  Thus we will lay a fine foundation for network troop training and operational simulation .  
There is a surplus supply of products of low technological level and low added value , and the productive capacity for such products is also excessive .  As for high-tech and high-added-value products , both their supply and productive capacity are inadequate .  Some of these products have to be imported .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
We have taken the complementary paths of pre-study and modeling , import and self-development , scientific research and production , military products and civil products , and scientific and technological development and nurturing of human talent for scientific research units being brought into the marketplace in order to implement high starting points for development and a name brand strategy and advance into the " open " market seeking new points for profit increase .  
In the current world , developed countries of the West occupy principal and controlling positions in international division of labor .  They have obvious economic and scientific and technological advantages , and occupy beneficial positions in international competition .  
The party and Government of the DPRK have attached extremely great importance to the scientific and technological investment in agricultural production and have organized the National Academy of Sciences , the Academy of Agricultural Sciences , the " shock team " composed of outstanding scientific and technological personnel selected from universities of agriculture , and some other scientific research institutes to cultivate improved varieties of crops and tackle the key problems in agricultural production .  
In today 's world , where economic globalization is making rapid development , scientific and technological progress is changing everyday , and countries are intensifying their competition to raise comprehensive national strength , it is particularly important to stir up and encourage the national innovative spirit .  
In order to overcome several limitations of their combat vehicles , including a long and wide body , a limited field of vision , and so on , the regiment organized its vehicle crew to drive the " Dongfeng " Type-145 truck for a week first in order to find out and feel all sorts of functions and parameters of their extra-long and extra-wide heavy-duty vehicles and this laid a psychological and technological basis for them to drive or operate their light armored vehicles .  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
The entire army turned righteous indignation into the concrete action of undergoing scientific and technological military training in protest of the flagrant use of guided missile by the US-led Nato to attack our embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
We must strengthen our efforts to cut off the supply of illegal drugs in Yunnan , Guangxi , and other border areas in China 's southwest , northwest , and northeast regions as well as in the southeast coastal region by increasing the use of scientific and technological equipment , intensifying investigation and arrests , firmly stopping the influx of illegal drugs , and strictly preventing the flow of precursor chemicals out of the restricted areas .  
It was pointed out in the " decision " of the all-army political work conference on the need to , with regard to the army 's political work reform , pay attention to " employing advanced scientific methods " , to " aggressively absorbing results of modern scientific and technological development and to giving play to the roles of modern information technology like computer networks and the mass media in the areas of information gathering , situation handling , knowledge dissemination , and ideological education " .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
In line with the special features that reconnaissance means should be applied to the future operational space - - air , sea , and ground - - in all weathers , this battalion launched a massive scientific and technological trailblazing campaign .  In accordance with the ways and means suggested by the officers and men , it worked out more than 30 new methods of operation to defend modern air raids , high-tech reconnaissance , and electronic welfare ; and transformed 108 camouflage devices .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
At 10:20 , the command center received from higher levels " an order of recruiting specialized technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment to support the front " .  It immediately started the plan for recruiting technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment from the national defense mobilization database and transmitted the plan to the various command sub-centers for scientific and technological mobilization .  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
The units involved have summed up and popularized the achievements that the army has made in scientific and technological troops training in recent years .  Through repeated attempts for improvement , innovation , and development , they have eventually solved knotty problems that have puzzled the army for a long time regarding operations under future hi-tech conditions .  
The general drilling site commander , with a sun-tanned face , declared : This combat drill indicates that , as a number of effective methods of scientific and technological troops training have been converted into combat strength , our army has made substantial progress in rapid barrier-breaking landing , operations to hit strongly built enemy targets , operations to counter precision strikes , camouflage of important military facilities , electronic countermeasure , and computer network protection .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
In today 's world , the scientific and technological revolution is advancing by leaps and bounds , a knowledge economy is rising rapidly , economic globalization is currently undergoing an increasingly accelerated process , and competition in comprehensive national strength is becoming more and more acute .  
The surging trend of new technological revolution and the knowledge economy in the world will not only provide a more advanced scientific and technological foundation for the development of socialism , but will also bring about a hidden risk of further widening the gap between the socialist countries with comparatively backward economic and cultural conditions and the developed capitalists countries .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
The Torpedo Examination and Repair Station successfully developed a " intelligent rapid charging technology " which cuts down submarine 's battery charging time by one half and has won the Navy 's scientific and technological progress award .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
clearly defined the relevant study tasks and targets ; organized officers and men to study electronics science , microelectronics science , photoelectron science and other modern scientific and technological know-how ; and laid a solid knowledge foundation for mastering new equipment , and conducting exercises on new subjects .  
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle , but its nature has changed a great deal " .  " The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army " .  
Anyone with the least understanding of international affairs knows that , given the level of economic and technological power possessed by Korea and Iran , in the foreseeable future , these nations have absolutely no ability to develop or deploy missiles which could strike the United States . And the idea that Iraq , which is under long-term United Nations supervision and embargo , could pose a missile threat to the US is even more a fantasy from the Arabian Nights .  
Supervision and management should be strengthened and landmark projects for technological transformation should be accomplished as scheduled .  Technological transformation must center on variety , quality , efficiency , and expansion of export .  High and new technology and advanced , applicable technology should be used to transform a batch of key enterprises in the important industries to develop products that enjoy competitive advantages and to stem redundant development in an effective way .  
During the exercise , this group army employed most of its new weapons , on the basis of a rational disposition and a flexible marshaling ; and by making a simultaneous use of technological means and tactical means and by integrating new and high technological means with traditional means , they successfully gave shape to a fairly complete electronic warfare system .  
The US strategy of human rights and values that we are talking about here is not simply a " soft " power , because it actually interacts with the strong superiority of the United States in the scientific and technological as well as economic fields , and also interacts with the active military presence of the United States in regions concerned .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
The party 's central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core not only consistently upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory and holds high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , but has also enriched and developed Deng Xiaoping Theory in combination with the new conditions and new experience in the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnical policy , military , diplomatic , united front , and party building fields , and added new contents to scientific system of Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
In order to promote economic structural adjustment and enhance international competitiveness as quickly as possible , it is imperative for China to strengthen its ability in scientific and technological innovation , positively adopt advanced technology to transform the traditional industries , give vigorous support to the development of new high-tech industry , and heighten the overall level of the equipment industry .  
His subjective dynamic role is subject to the restriction of his own scientific and cultural level as well as scientific and technological content . 
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
We should learn from his innovative spirit of " winning the war " and boldly scaling new heights , with which he has developed a strong awareness for guarding against future mishaps , for promoting the country 's scientific and technological development , and for making innovations ; strived to seize commanding heights in the fields of military theories as well as scientific and technological development ; and has achieved tangible results in comprehensively enhancing the ability of our army to " win the war " .  
Over the last two years , the scientific and technological military training has brought about profound changes in the guiding principle , contents , means and methods of military training , as well as in military tactics ; and has played an important role in enhancing the troops ' ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
" Let 's see who has won the most awards of reform success and who has scored the highest mark in scientific and technological knowledge contest " .  This was the earlier criterion of some units for appraising and selected advanced units and individuals in scientific and technological military training .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training .  It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops , actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness , stability and reliability of an achievement , the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
A military simulation system of the current advanced international level in the form of an online exercise technological platform has been manufactured after six years of development jointly carried out by dozens of the whole army 's academies and schools and scientific research units .  
These heroic units have demonstrated their new graceful bearing in operating new equipment and applying new technology in scientific and technological military training .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
The PLA 's success in carrying out the activities of exchanging successful experience of scientific and technological military training will yield an important effect on furthering the scientific and technological military training .  The participants in the activities included the leaders in charge of training and education of major participating units ; the leaders of the air force , naval fleets and second artillery bases under various military regions ;  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Therefore , the two sides will continue maintaining the momentum of high-level intercourse and contacts , deepening the mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological realms , strengthening the omni-directional exchange and cooperation in all realms , and improve the communication and coordination in international and regional affairs .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
At the current ASEM , Premier Zhu Rongji once again gave an important speech , also through extensive contacts and exchanges with Asian and European leaders , he enunciated China 's standpoints and opinions on Asian-European exchange and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , scientific , and technological fields , thus forcefully promoting the further expansion of consensus between Asia and Europe and the establishment of the cooperative partnership in the new century .  
Today , the tidal waves of a new scientific and technological revolution marked by the universal application of information technologies are sweeping across the globe with great momentum , and the trend of accelerated reorganization of the world economic structure is increasingly prominent .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
Only by comprehensively improving the tactical technological performance of the network of fire according to the needs of operation so that it will remain in perfect shape under various complicated circumstances of the battlefield before it can give full play to its potential in an actual operation and can it really become an " unbeatable rival " of missiles .  
and so on , and should devote more efforts to changing structure of qualified network personnel and training qualified military personnel for fighting a battle on an information network , including qualified command and control personnel at both intermediate and senior levels , qualified personnel who can operate , organize , or manage an information network system , and qualified scientific and technological personnel or groups of personnel who can operate an information network at a higher level so as to bring about such transformation as qualified military personnel operating a network .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .  A modern anti-chemical warfare system being capable of observation , detection , cleanup , diffusing smoke and burning has been formed .  The main battle outfit is capable of defense against the three kinds of attacks .  
Upon receiving orders , the anti-chemical warfare battalion of a group army under the Lanzhou Military Region immediately took part in rescue work .  Through 34 hours of hard efforts , the battalion successfully completed its task without harm to a single soldier .  It has demonstrated the high technological and tactical level of anti-chemical warfare troops and their indomitable style and fearless spirit .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
Such infiltration is not limited to the ideological and cultural fields , but has also be extended to the economic , political , military , scientific , and technological fields .  In their exchanges with us , they also brought ideological things along with them .  
Although many things in Western economic theories reflect the common regularity in mass production and market operation in an era of scientific and technological revolution , being the reflection of the basic economic relations in capitalist society , in essence , such theories just embody the requirements of the capitalist economic system in its contemporary development .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
These leaders and institutions should make full use of every modern news media to propagate the grand prospects of our military modernization project in an effort to attract more outstanding scientific and technological specialists who must be patriotic and determined to strengthen the motherland so that these talented individuals can achieve merit in their military careers .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
In order to implement Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong army with science and technology and to fully mobilize enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technological cadres , with the approval of the Central Military Commission , the four general departments have jointly issued a circular on raising relevant treatment for some senior experts in our army as of this year .  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
As a vice president and the chief designer of China 's Research Institute of Air-to-Air Missiles , he took charge of and gave direct leadership to scientific and technological personnel designing and finalizing many types of air-to-air missiles , thus making the our country 's research and development of air-to-air missiles climb onto one new stage after another from starting from scratch to copying and self-designing and until reaching the international advanced level .  
On the basis of analyzing these broken fragments , Dong Bingyin led the scientific and technological personnel in dissecting the generator laden with explosives at the risk of their life for a year .  Through conducting nearly 100 major and minor tests and obtaining up to 1,000 data entries , he finally proved that it was the interference of the missile holder which caused the incident , thus paving the way for resuming the range test .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
According to what has been disclosed by a relevant department today , ever since the state started its " 863 Program " 15 years ago , nearly 10,000 scientific and technological personnel from the army have successively plunged themselves into the research work .  Displaying their outstanding ability and talents to the fullest in high technological fields , they have attained a series of major scientific and technological achievements .  
Groups of scientific and technological personnel , consisting mainly of the academicians of the two academies of sciences , experts , and professors , have successively completed some 1,500 research topics ; made breakthroughs on more than 100 major and key technologies ; won 397 Awards for Scientific and Technological Progress at both the national level and the ministerial-commission level , as well as 137 state patents for invention ;  
During the process of completing the " 863 " research topics , the scientific and technological personnel throughout the army as well as scientific research administrations at all levels have also carried out bold practices in the field of high-tech management .  Today , they have opened up a new path for high-tech research and development which requires less input but can yield a higher economic efficiency , and have laid a solid foundation for a sustainable development in the future .  
It was with the spirit of facing the gap , being unwilling to lag behind , striving to catch up with developed countries , being independent and innovative and consistently assailing scientific heights which is upheld by the majority of scientific and technological workers that enabled us to gain our precious foothold in the extraordinarily fierce high-tech competition .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
At the same time , with rapid scientific and technological development , the growing dominance of the knowledge economy and network economy in social and economic development , and continual acceleration of economic globalization , the contests of scientific and technological , economic , and comprehensive national capabilities are becoming increasingly fierce .  
" Small , remote , scattered and directly administered " military units work in such posts as telecom , piloting , scientific and technological studies and logistics supply , and carry out such tasks as fighting , training , military duties and logistics supply .  Most of these units call for high technological levels , shouldering important responsibilities , work in crucial posts , and play a vital role in grassroots construction .  These units are also a difficult issue to handle in grassroots construction .  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
After the cold war , when the balance of power tipped toward the West , the United States went one step farther in politicizing the above-mentioned concept of human rights , using military , economic and technological power as a shield and scheming to put respect for human dignity in an unassailable position , making it the starting point and final resting place of peace and development .  The United States imposed her own standard of human rights on all the nations of the world , and changed the human rights question into a political tool for hegemony .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that as innovation is an inexhaustible driving force of a nation , we should be bold in making innovation , inclusive of theoretical innovation , structural innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and the innovation in other fields .  
The vast number of theoretical workers should take pains to undertake the lofty mission of theoretical innovation which has been entrusted to them by the age , persistently emancipate their minds , make courageous exploration , observe and take hold of the trends of economic , political , scientific and technological , and cultural development in the contemporary world as well as the great changes in China today , and strive to make new progress and new contributions in theoretical innovation .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
" Substantial Increase " in Three Areas ; Solid Foundation for Rejuvenating the Country Through Science and TechnologyThe Outline sets forth the main anticipated targets for scientific and technological and educational development as follows : By 2005 , the proportion of research and development funds of entire society held in the GDP will be raised to 1.5 percent or more ; the achievements in basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education will be further consolidated ; 
During a major contest organized by their fleet to review scientific and technological training , Zhang and his crew won first place in 14 single categories and became the champion of the whole contest .  
In the 1990s , he organized the military units to successfully fulfill the tasks of foreign friendly exchanges , equipment and technology imports , academic and technological exchanges , multilateral military diplomatic activity , and maritime military safety negotiations .  
We shall takedevelopment as a main theme , take restructuring as a main line , take reform , opening-up , scientific and technological innovations as driving forces , andtake the enhancement of the people 's living standards as a fundamental startingpoint , continue to promote comprehensive economic and social development .  
Over the past 100 years , the world underwent untold tribulations caused bywars , diseases , hunger , crises , and disasters ; but more importantly , the peopleof various countries carried out momentous social and natural struggles on amagnificent scale , and thus made unprecedented progress in the political , economic , ideological , cultural , scientific , technological , education , military , and medical aspects .  
In his speech on a special subject , Professor Chen Ting-kuo from Taiwan Tanchiang University said that Taiwan boasts relative advantages in production management , global marketing management , and the management of scientific and technological research and development , while mainland 's advantages lie in the vast territory , large population , and other aspects , so the two sides should pay attention to combining each other 's advantages for economic development .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
He noted that for many years China and France have engaged in effective cooperation in economic , scientific , technological , cultural , and other areas .  He expressed the hope that the two countries and the people of China and France would continue to cooperate in cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields and jointly contribute to the building of a beautiful future in the new century .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
We are happy to see that since the normalization of the two countries ' relations , high-level leaders of the two parties and two countries have conducted frequent mutual visits , and both sides ' exchanges and cooperation have expanded and developed in a more in-depth manner in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
For instance , our per-capita natural resources are lower than the average global level , insufficient education among our people contrasts with the rapid growth of economic and social management and scientific and technological knowledge , and these kinds of restrictions deny China either a resource advantage or a technological advantage for international economic cooperation .  
It may promote economic and social progress , narrow the gap between the rich and the poor , and break down geographical barriers to the market and to prosperity .  But it also may exclude or leave behind those countries that lag in technological innovation and drive them to a even lower level of development . "  
Top level leaders have frequently exchanged visits , while contacts and cooperation are increasingly expanded and deepened in the political , economic , military , scientific , technological , and cultural fields .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
Over the last 20 years , the intellectual property system has become a basic legal system and major policy means of various countries to give impetus to technological innovation , and has played a significant role in invigorating economy and enhancing international competitiveness .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .  
We are willing to strive hard , together with all countries in the world , for the institution of a fair and rational intellectual property system favorable to promoting scientific and technological as well as economic development in various countries , and for the creation of a fine environment of respecting knowledge , advocating science , and protecting intellectual property rights for all humanity .  
In recent years , China and Austria increasingly enhanced their exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , cultural , and environmental protection fields and also increased friendly exchanges at the provincial and city level .  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
The standard attained by a country 's universities reflects from one aspect the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and is also a major expression of the country 's all-round national strength .  
The exhibition reflected Tsinghua 's major scientific and technological innovations as well as the achievements attained in the tackling of major technological hurdles , basic research , and technological research for national defense .  The fields involved information , nuclear energy and technology , life science and technology , new materials , energy and environment , and advanced manufacturing .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The level attained by the universities of a country actually reflects the level of scientific , technological , and cultural development attained by the whole country , and this is also a major embodiment of this country 's comprehensive national strength .  The building of first-class universities attaining the world 's advanced level in our country will require great support from the party , the government , and all social circles ;  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
At times of war , it is necessary to include counter-rescue operations into the entire process of anti-air raid operations , plan carefully , and organize in particular a keen-witted and capable counter-rescue squad equipped with the capacity of making swift responses and a strong maneuverable power , or a relevant squad which has undergone certain technological and tactical training can be designated to assume the anti-rescue task .  
Social development , especially in the modern era , has enmeshed military action more closely into the political , economic , diplomatic , and scientific and technological arenas .  More military means are now available for achieving specific politic goals , and the range of activities covered by military struggles is gradually widening .  
Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .  They are mature and stable in terms of their technological standard , and capable of independently handling more complicated situations .  Moreover , since they are the ones who give demonstrations and guidance to novices , they are considered the " high production units " in the operation .  
At the Guangdong Trade Show , there was one point of view which received general assent : The leap from a large foreign trade country to a foreign trade power rests on transformation of China 's entire economic structure and expansion methods , and within that transformation there must be strong promotion of new high technology export products in addition to the use of new high technology to refurbish traditional industries and raise the overall technological content and value added of export products .  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
For example , we can make use of advanced scientific and technological means to establish an appraisal and evaluation system composed of different quality indexes , which can integrate qualitative assessment with quantitative analysis and can link the appraisal made by party organizations with the evaluation conducted by the masses ; enhance the accuracy and rationality of our selection and our use of cadres ; and minimize the adverse influences that may be produced by man-made factors .  
With the scientific and technological progress and the development of modern education , peasants can master better work skills and richer scientific and general knowledge .  This will provide a major driving force for changing the structure of agriculture and the rural economy .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
It is present in political , economic , military , scientific and technological , and cultural education ; its core values are patriotism , revolutionary heroism , and the spirit of dedication ; and its ultimate objectives are to boost all citizens ' will , skills , and physical capabilities in loving , developing , and defending their motherland , so that they can firmly adopt the idea of " being prepared for danger in times of peace " and " joining hands to resist foreign aggression . "  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Major projects manifest the first principle of national goals on a high level , taking their point of departure from solving problems related to the demands of national economic construction and sustainable social development , with a focus on surmounting major technological problems .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
Over the past few years , in particular , under the conditions of a large base figure of population , limited per capita resources , and relatively backward economic and scientific and technological levels , our rapid economic development has brought enormous pressures to the originally weak ecological environment , so that the situation in environment is even grimmer .  
In May , 2000 , the PLA demonstrated in the Nanjing Military Region a series of single-soldier training topics by stressing a reform in the following two aspects : As for training contents , the PLA for the first time prioritized training in comprehensive quality by taking training in modern military technology as the mainstay and training in " three capabilities ( intellectual capability , technological capability , and physical capability ) " as the vital ingredients ;  
As market competition gets increasingly sharp , state-owned enterprises , especially state-owned large companies and enterprise groups must strive to become international advanced enterprises , have an accurate grasp of the changes in domestic and international markets and the development direction of leading technology , find out the gap with international advanced enterprises , formulate a scientific and rational development strategy and a technological innovation plan , and clearly define what they endeavor to catch up with and surpass and where they should develop themselves .  
Over the last half a century , mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries have developed in an all-round way in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and scientific and technological fields .  The two governments and peoples have always understood , trusted , and supported each other .  
The northwest region of Shaanxi , Gansu , Ningxia , Qinghai , and Xinjiang has a vast territory , a large number of high scientific and technological personnel , and economic characteristics , and the combination of Hong Kong 's funds with the achievements in high science and technology in these areas will turn out to be a big fortune .  What is more , the rich resources there are buried treasures pending development .  
We must provide scientific , safe , convenient and effective birth control services to the wide masses of child-bearing age , thoroughly set up technological service networks for family planning , pay close attention to strengthening the construction of technological service networks in farming and animal husbandry zones , and make efforts to enhance service capacity .  
and expand the scale of exports .  Meanwhile , they should also strive to attract foreign investment by various means ; particularly , they are urged to pay close attention to the building of the soft environment , adopt earnest steps to protect the interests of foreign investors , and devote great efforts to running well existing national-level economic and technological development zones as well as foreign-invested enterprises .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
Asia and Europe are also known for superior economic , scientific , and technological strength , rich human resources , and vast markets which can not be found elsewhere , and this has provided a sound basis for the two sides to strengthen bilateral cooperation .  
We should work out long-term plans for cooperation in accordance with the principle of ensuring mutual benefit and drawing upon each other 's strong points , explore effective concrete measures to this end , and deepen in an all-round way bilateral cooperation and exchanges in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , educational , environmental , and other fields in order to constantly widen the road of Asian-European cooperation and make fresh headway in this direction . 
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Their arduous efforts have brought about a great change in the look of poor areas : Their production means and living conditions have been markedly improved ; their production level raised by a big margin ; and great progress has been made in the scientific and technological , educational , cultural , and public health fields .  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .

Bian Jiagui , deputy director of the Beijing Garrison Command 's Political Department , said that extraordinarily rapid scientific and technological development throughout the world is embodied not only in economic fields but also in military fields .  Military cadres should devote greater efforts to delving into science and technology and continuously improve their abilities in every field .  Only in this way can military cadres set up a solid foundation for being competitive in the non-military sectors after their demobilization .  
Hu Jintao pointed out : Since the beginning of this year , the whole party and the whole nation have been conscientiously implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee and the party Central Committee 's major policy decisions and vigorously advancing the drive for socialist modernization by persistently taking development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic goal .  
In ancient times , because the level of social productive forces was low and the technological equipment of armed forces was backward , with a lack of variety in arms and services and relatively simple operational methodology , the main format of operations was uniformly infantry engagement on the ground .  
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .  
He said : The meeting also stressed the importance of economic and technological cooperation to ensuring sustained and healthy development of the Asia-Pacific economy , and decided to endeavor to narrow the gaps between the economic bodies in order to realize common prosperity .  
They won 8 medals for achievements in special military skills competition and in " " revolutionization , modernization , regularization " , meritorious service reward for 51 man-times , and two distinguished honors of winning the titles of " advanced regiment in scientific and technological training " and " advanced regiment in overall construction " .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
The brigade 's new equipment is technology intensive and requires complicated operations .  In connection with this reality , the brigade made the training of a contingent of personnel capable of tackling key scientific and technological problems a core issue in resolving training problems and the improvement of quality and performance an important way to shortening the cycle for transforming new equipment into combat strength .  
To this end , while making efforts to build the command , operation , and technical contingents and in connection with its efforts to tackle key scientific and technological problems in equipment development and training reform , it actively encouraged cadres having development potentials to attend academic symposiums and research results reviewing conferences sponsored by the superior organs , research units , and colleges and schools in an effort to broaden their vision and enable them to have unclogged access to information .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
It is necessary to fully explore scientific and technological strengths on the basis of accommodating characteristics of information society and to build the military 's internal network of information on political education and make such a network operational as soon as possible , so as to reduce the number of levels and simplify procedures to ensure that education can keep up on a timely basis , respond rapidly , work effectively , and produce real results .  
The fact that radar antenna occupies huge space , radar includes many parts , and radar equipment has limited functions will bring problems to the task of mobilization and transfer .  In order to overcome the problems , the unit has organized a small group for technological innovation , and fully applied more than 20 innovation achievements to this model of radar .  As a result , the unit has resolved such problems as below-standard transmitting power of the radar launcher and weak signals received by the receiver .  
Besides such advantages as having a reasonable design , exhaustive functions , and being easy to operate and safe and reliable , this type of power distribution equipment can save more than 200,000 yuan of the yearly equipment expense for the unit .  The equipment has won the third prize of national patent and scientific and technological advancement in the whole army .  
Meanwhile , a number of transportation projects were completed one after another , including the Dalian-Qinhuangdao railway , China 's first electrified coal-transporting railroad , and the Changyuan Dongming railroad bridge , the longest such bridge in Asia . The completion of a number of large cutting-edge scientific research projects which meet advanced international standards , such as the positive-negative electronic collider , heavy ion accelerator , and national radiation laboratory , has demonstrated China 's scientific and technological ( S &amp; T ) prowess .

At the same time , they were pleased and satisfied with the fine relations existing between the two countries as well as with the development of those  
Scientists and technologists are the valuable wealth of the Party and the state .  In the world today , the core of competition for comprehensive national strength is competition in science and technology , and the core of competition in science and technology is a contest for scientific and technological talents .  Implementation of the strategy for reinvigorating the country through science and education has set up a wide stage for China 's scientific and technological workers to serve the motherland and has created an unprecedented , favorable environment .  
He stressed China must sensitively keep pace with the general trend of the current scientific-technological development , fully assess the great significance of future scientific-technological development to human society , heighten their sense of urgency and , taking into consideration of the actual needs of China 's development , act immediately to catch up with the world 's advanced scientific and technological research and press forward to create a new situation for China 's thriving scientific-technological development .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
Wen Jiabao required that the sixth national committee of the association continue to deepen reforms and expand the new scope of work on the basis of previous achievements , further the efforts of making the association a main channel for academic exchanges and scientific knowledge popularization , make the association a main representative of China in international non-official scientific and technological exchanges , build up the image as the " home of scientists and technologists , " and promote the development of its work in all fields .  
Cadres of naval and air forces have organized for party members and cadres , in light of the six-point requirements proposed by the General Department of Politics on maintaining the advanced nature of party members , to identify their weaknesses in ideological and political qualities and scientific , technological and cultural abilities , and strengthen the military 's sense of the urgency and responsibilities for advancing the military construction .  
second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
We must further liberate thinking , renew ideas , persist in regarding development as the theme , structural readjustment as the base line , liberalized reforms and scientific and technological progress as the driving force , and improvement of the people 's standard of living as the fundamental starting point , use creative thinking to resolve the prominent issues arising in the process of economic and social development in Tibet , and put into place good cycles in Tibet work .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
In keeping with the economic , political and cultural requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , all comrades in the party and all people in the country should strive to achieve the development goals set for the Tenth Five-Year Plan . We should focus on development through economic restructuring and by relying on reform , opening up and scientific and technological progress with a view to improving people 's living standards and constantly pushing for economic growth and social progress .  
Through development of more than 50 years , especially in the development of reform and opening up during the past two decades , China has established important ideological and political foundation and possessed a material , technological and human resource foundation for achieving the main modernization by the middle of this century .  
While importing and absorbing internationally advanced technologies , on their own they also research , developed , and set up a technological platform and machinery production base for advanced explosion suppressing materials .  With this as the foundation , China 's largest explosion suppression materials production base has begun to be established in Shantou City , Guangdong Province . When phase one goes into production , it will have a yearly production capacity of 10,000 tons of explosion suppressing material .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
It is a rather complete system of science in the aspects of philosophy , political economy , and scientific socialism and covers the economic , political , scientific and technological , educational , cultural , ethnic , military , foreign affairs , united front , and party building aspects .  It is also a system of science to be further enriched and developed in all aspects .  
An expert working on a certain base of the General Armament Department said that faced with new situations and tasks , scientific researchers must strive to realize the important ideology of the " Three Represents , " to occupy the main battle position of the world 's advanced military scientific and technological development , and to become the advanced representatives for the modernization construction and development of the weapons and equipment of the Chinese Army .  
The circular requires that all military units provide more technological , educational , cultural , and medical support to the people in poor areas , thus helping them develop the ability to shake off poverty and get rich .

Since China and Ukraine established diplomatic relations 10 years ago , exchanges and cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , educational , cultural , sports , and other fields between our two countries have continued to broaden , and encouraging results have been achieved .  
Both sides are continuously expanding and deepening cooperation and exchange in the political , economic and trade , scientific and technological , educational , cultural fields , and maintain the fine tradition of positive consultation and close cooperation in international affairs .  Satisfactory results have been achieved .  
Now , although the profits of those big companies that prop up the US economy have declined , their overall performance is not bad and they remain very competitive internationally .  The potential for higher labor productivity driven by technological revolution will not be reversed .  This is why the performance of the " Dow Jones index , " dominated by traditional industries , betters that of the " Nasdaq index . "  
to try hard to bring about sustainable development .  We must vigorously enhance the quality of workers and promote economic development by relying on the deepening of the reform and on scientific and technological advancement and paying particular attention to making a good job of reforming state-owned enterprises and enhancing their vitality .  
At present , the international situation is complex and dynamic , our reform and construction are at a crucial moment of development and our Party 's self-construction is in a new stage of development .  Proposing the important thinking of the " three represents " will greatly accelerate theory innovation , system innovation and scientific and technological innovation in our Party and our country .  The PLA is an important force to embody the Party 's and the national political advantages .  
It was an important material foundation for economic growth , technological progress , and social stability in the developed countries after World War II , where lay the crucial reason for the economic backwardness and social poverty of developing countries .  
The speech expounded in an all-round way the important guiding principles put forward by the fifth plenary session on comprehensively pushing forward economic development and social progress by making development the theme ; structural adjustment the main line ; reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force ;  
Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
Third , take scientific and technological progress as a driving force , use high and new technology and advanced technologies to transform traditional industries and change the mode of industrial production growth according to the actual conditions in Tianjin , promote industrialization by means of adopting advanced information technology , continuously enhance the overall quality and market competition power of the enterprises .  
As has been learned from relevant departments in mid-August , the Second Artillery Corps has achieved fruitful results in its personnel construction thanks to ceaseless efforts in implementing the " human resources relay " project .

Both sides have seen continuous high-level exchanges , rapid development in trade relations , ever expanding economic and technological cooperation , and productive exchanges in cultural , sports , and other areas .  The forum plans to officially set up a trade representative office in China this year .  
Wu Hailong said that this year the APEC meeting discussed in depth trade and investment liberalization , strengthening of a multilateral trade structure , economic and technological cooperation , exploitation of human resources , and new economies , among other issues .  The results achieved in the meeting laid a sound foundation for the October informal APEC leaders ' meeting and ministerial meeting to be held in Shanghai .  
In view of this , we should make a full use of abundant local animal and plant resources , act in line with the requirement of seeking a unity between economic efficiency and ecological efficiency , and gear ourselves to the needs of the market and rely on scientific and technological advances .  We should intensify the structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy ; vigorously develop a highly efficient production of fine-quality medicinal materials , special foodstuffs , and green foodstuffs ;  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
Li Lanqing pointed out : Although the objectives of the state-owned enterprises ' ridding themselves of difficulties within three years have been basically achieved yet , taken as a whole , a considerable gap still exists in such areas as changing concept , carrying out reform and innovation , making technological progress , protecting environment , intensifying management , raising quality , and catching up with and surpassing the world 's advanced levels .  
Li Lanqing stressed : All enterprises must , on the one hand , have their eyes on the outside world , keeping abreast of the development trend of the advanced enterprises at home and abroad , and on the other hands , have their eyes on our own country , finding out the gaps , getting to know our deficiencies , and expediting institutional innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and management innovation around the enhancement of enterprises ' quality and competitiveness .  
The great majority of people in these new social classes are playing an important role in promoting the scientific and technological progress of the country , activating our urban and rural markets , optimizing the allocation of resources , creating more jobs , meeting the diversified demands of our people , and boosting the development of the national economy .  
4 .  The two sides agreed that the two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , cultural , educational , public health , and scientific and technological fields had brought tangible benefits to both countries and their people .  
Ministers and their representatives from member economies reached a common understanding on a wide range of issues , such as cooperation in advancing technological innovation , facilitating financing , improving the environment for SME development , strengthening SME human capacity building and interacting with the business sector , put forward many proposals for future growth , and adopted the Joint Ministerial Statement of the Eighth APEC SME Ministerial Meeting .  
As the Chinese have more and more profoundly realized the decisive effect of the ever-advancing science and technology on the economy , it can be predicted that the SOEs will pay greater attention , either in an active or passive attitude , to the import , assimilation , and development of the new high technology , and a new technological innovative system with enterprises as its center will be established in China too .  
The State Economic and Trade Commission has proposed to set up technological development centers in over 500 key enterprises , and more than two-thirds of the large and medium enterprises will strive to set up similar organizations within two to three years .  In the meantime , the technological innovative supporting systems geared to the needs of the medium and small enterprises will be set up in 30 central cities .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .  
With General Secretary Jiang 's caring and support , Shenzhen will work hard to catch up with advanced currents of scientific and technological development of the world by vigorously relying on scientific and technological innovation and system innovation ; Shenzhen will , according to the spirit of the instruction of " creating new strong points and moving to a higher level , " seek to be the first to achieve socialist modernization , so as to make greater contributions to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
How to make plans for technological renovation , the strategic development of high technology , and the realization of the industrialization of higher technology are of extremely great significance to promoting the revitalization of the country with science and education , increasing China 's comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness , and promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
Minister Zhu said that the reason for prominently emphasizing further strengthening technological renovation and regarding technological renovation , developing high technology , and realizing the industrialization of high technology as work that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the country is closely related to the changes in the general international economic environment and the fact that China 's economy and technology have developed to a considerable stage .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
and eventually enable its government revenue to pick up and rise .  Insofar as international experiences are concerned , the United States began to reduce spending , enhance efficiency , increase scientific and technological investment , and consolidate its foundation and reinforce its internal strength in the 1990s and has attained excellent results .  However , Japan has chosen to raise taxes without reducing public spending with the result that the Japanese economy has stagnated .  
The continuous access of international environmental protection enterprises to China will bring along equipment with high technological contents and fine quality , which is of positive significance to enhancing the overall level of China 's environmental protection sector .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .  The new military means and modes of warfare are still governed by traditional rules of war , including the restrictions of international laws ; there is no legal vacuum .  
In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
Female senior engineer Su Longxu , aged 37 , has developed over 40 scientific and technological accomplishments over the past 10 years .  Out of the total , seven were first-class and second-class awards for military scientific and technological progress , and eight items were awarded national patents .  Ninety percent of the scientific and technological accomplishments have been promoted and applied extensively .  
Along with scientific and technological progress and structural readjustment , the economy 's dependence on and demand for traditional industries and departments have fallen and this has become the fundamental factor that has resulted in a fall in the production speed of coal , metallurgical materials , and other building materials known for consuming a large quantity of energy or materials or relying heavily on the transportation trade or products . 
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .  
The main content of the program is as follows : emphasizing the conducting of high-tech development in concentrated manner , with the technologies to be developed capable of resulting in the locating and triggering the most effective economic growth points , so as to lay a foundation for fundamentally changing the economic structure , to make exports oriented toward final products with high technology contents , and to satisfy the demand of domestic markets with domestic products of high technological standards ;  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .  
The sustained and rapid growth of the past 20 years has laid down a comparatively solid material and technological foundation for the giant advance of infrastructure construction , particularly in the fields of communications , telecommunications , energy , and so on , and has augmented the reserved strength of economic development .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
Experts say that faced with a new development trend in the world auto industry marked by concentration , development of high and technologies , globalization of management , and by sophisticated production methods , China 's auto industry must develop a modern enterprise system that is adapted to that of foreign developed countries .  Reform , restructuring , and technological innovation are the fundamental way out to raise enterprises ' competitiveness .  
Li Xu'e , vice chairman of the NPC Science , Education , Cultural , and Public Health Committee ; Li Guoguang , vice president of the Supreme People 's Court ; as well as the representatives of the intellectual property rights circles and the enterprise circles have aired their respective views at the symposium on a number of special subjects , such as giving full rein to the patent system and extending support for the growth of those new and high technological products which enjoy both independent intellectual property rights and a sound market prospect .  
The spokesman for the Great Hall Industrial Company pointed out : We have noticed that recently the US media have devoted lots of space to carrying reports which state that the US State Department claimed that in the course of developing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological assistance from the Lockheed Martin Company .  
On 6 April , the " Washington Post " " New York Times " and other media in the United States devoted a large space to the report that the US State Department claimed that in the process of developing and manufacturing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological aid from the Lockheed Martin Company , and this has aroused the concerns of the Chinese and US space technology circles .  
The main method to be used for this task is adopt sound environmental protection standards and technical norms and , based on these standards and norms , build a protective wall to ensure environmental protection and technological quality .  
During his visits , President Jiang exchanged with the heads of state , heads of government , and parliamentary leaders of the six nations in-depth views on bilateral relations and the current international situation .  He also made extensive contacts with personalities of the economic and trade , business , science and technological , educational , and cultural circles of the six nations ; and visited and investigated factories , farming villages , and some representative cultural facilities .  
As the Chinese have more and more profoundly realized the decisive effect of the ever-advancing science and technology on the economy , it can be predicted that the SOEs will pay greater attention , either in an active or passive attitude , to the import , assimilation , and development of the new high technology , and a new technological innovative system with enterprises as its center will be established in China too .

He also made extensive contacts with personalities of the economic and trade , business , science and technological , educational , and cultural circles of the six nations ; and visited and investigated factories , farming villages , and some representative cultural facilities .  
In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
The Ministry is adopting economic , technological and legal means , as well as the necessary administrative means , to control the total domestic transport capacity .  It supports and encourages the use of standardized , serialized and modern vessels on inland rivers .  Through relevant legislation , it will gradually take compulsory measures to eliminate cement vessels , wooden vessels , motor row boats , technological backward vessels , old vessels , and barges towed in tandem .  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
He pointed out : In the new stage , the major tasks for China 's comprehensive agricultural development are to continue strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction , support and promote agricultural structural readjustment , actively push forward agricultural scientific and technological advancement , and protect and improve the ecological environment .  
In order to suit the changes in the domestic and international markets and meet with the challenges of the WTO entry , various localities must act according to the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important instructions on quickening technological advancement , conscientiously put into effect the guidelines of the fourth plenary session of the 15th party 's central committee , and carry out the work of technical innovation in a thoroughgoing way to promote the adjustment , optimization , and upgrading of the economic structure as a whole .  
Relations of cooperation between the two countries have been constantly reinforced in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural fields ; there have been constant high-level contacts between the two armies ; and exchanges are being carried out in multiple fields and at multiple levels .  
The party 's leading organs or grassroots organizations , the party 's organizations in both the enterprises and the rural areas , and our work in economic , scientific , technological , education , ideological , or political fields should embody in an all-round way the requirement of " three represents . "  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
China 's political stability and economic development provide a solid , substantive technological foundation with the complete conditions and capability to catch up with the advanced tide of global science and technology .  
If we do not speed up development of China 's economic and scientific and technological undertakings and work hard to narrow the gap with advanced global levels , we will have a difficult time taking hold of initiative in the fierce international competition .  
Development of economic construction and scientific and technological undertakings requires the Party and the country to formulate proper policies , the strong support of all levels of Party administration and government , the unrelenting hard work of the numerous science and technology workers , and the common participation of all the people across the country .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
Attention should be paid to increasing the proportion of the third industry , and greatly strengthening the economic vitality of the entire city , while at the same time putting a great effort behind promoting technological updates .  Enterprises developing new high technologies should be put in a prominent position , to allow manufacturing to develop in a reasonable direction .  
Fourth , colleges , universities , scientific and technological research institutes , and hi-tech enterprises in the vicinity of the S &amp; T park should also make contributions to local development , converting scientific and technological achievements , fostering professional personnel , promoting education , paying taxes according to law , building a civilized community , and promoting socialist spiritual civilization .  
Science and technology constitute a primary productive force , and scientific and technological progress is a decisive factor impacting economic development .  To represent the development demand of China 's advanced productive forces , our party must actively develop science and technology , facilitate economic construction by shifting our reliance onto scientific and technological progress and raising the workers ' qualities , and continually enhance China 's economic and comprehensive strength .  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
In this era , knowledge and capable personnel are the greatest capital for economic development and the competition of comprehensive national strength , and the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements has become a power force promoting the development of the productive forces .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .  
the multi-polarization trend in the world pattern is irreversible ; and the competition of comprehensive national strength with the economic , scientific , technological , and military strength as well as national cohesion as the main content is tending to become more acute .  Judging from the general situation , peace and development remain the theme of the times .  
In particular , in the past 10 years , top-level leaders of the two countries have frequently exchanged mutual visits , and bilateral exchange and cooperation in political , economic , trade , scientific and technological , and cultural fields have developed comprehensively .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
At the conference , Fu Quanyou , member of the Central Military Commission [ CMC ] and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] , stressed : Deepening military training by scientific and technological means is implementing the important ideology of President Jiang Zemin 's " three represents , " and a major measure and basic practical activity for solid and effective preparations for military struggle .  
The army at all levels must follow the principles for military strategy in the new period and consider military training by scientific and technological means as the most direct and most effective preparations for military struggle .  It is necessary to educate officers and men about the arduous situation of military struggle , raise the army 's morale by stressing the importance of the people 's army 's fundamental functions , and use the revolutionary spirit of fighting for victory to arouse the fighting spirit and comprehensively raise the army 's capability to win wars .  
Military training by scientific and technological means is a comprehensive and profound change , which will have a fundamental , complete , and deep influence on military training , military struggle , and army-building .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
Taken internationally , science and technology are advancing rapidly with each passing day in the world at present , the process of globalization is gathering pace , the trend toward a multi-polar world pattern is irreversible , and the competition in comprehensive national strength taking the economic , scientific and technological , and military strength and national cohesion as principal contents is increasingly vehement .  
Since the founding of the People 's Republic of China , Chinese scientists and engineers have exhibited their wisdom and talents and creatively resolved many major scientific and technological problems , swiftly narrowing the gap with advanced world levels in some important fields and effectively bringing forward China 's economic and social development .  
I am convinced , positive scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation among countries of different social systems , economic modes , cultural traditions , and development levels are beneficial to the relevant parties and the entire world 's development .  
It became the first book which introduced China to the West . On 6 November 1970 , China and Italy formally established diplomatic ties , thereby opening up a new chapter of friendship and cooperation .  Both countries have made comprehensive progress in facilitating political , economic , trade , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological cooperation .  
In view of this and in consideration of the current regional and surrounding geopolitical circumstances , all sides have determined to deepen cooperation in the political , diplomatic , economic and trade , military , military technological , and other fields to consolidate regional peace and stability .

Today , it is especially important to pay attention to developing material circulation and allocation and delivery and use modern management methods and service techniques to transform traditional commerce and increase the technological content and raise service standard to promote the rise in the overall standard of the circulation industry .  
Since China decided to launch a manned satellite in 1992 , the spaceflight scientific research department has solved many key technological problems and mustered many technologies .  The department successfully fired China 's first " Shenzhou " spaceship in November 1999 .  
Hu Jintao noted : Youths are the most active and dynamic force in the entire society .  In the face of a rapid scientific and technological development in today 's world and under China 's current conditions of reform , opening up , and socialist market economic development , in particular , young people are playing an increasingly important role in our economic and social lives .  
Against this backdrop , China 's foreign affairs work in the fields of science and technology will be carried out closely around the science and technology development strategy , and will aim at cutting-edge science and technology in the international arena .  China will conduct international science and technology cooperation of a higher level on the basis of equality , mutual benefit , and shared achievements , enhance the country 's scientific and technological creation ability , develop advanced science and technology , and serve the industrialization of new technology .  
These are the key tasks in the development of the west now and in the foreseeable future : Accelerate infrastructural construction , step up ecological and environmental protection , consolidate the status of agriculture as the base , adjust the industrial structure , develop specialty tourism , and develop scientific , technological , education , cultural , and public health undertakings .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
Zeng : To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should be adapted to the trend of economic globalization and China 's upcoming accession to the WTO , seize the opportunity of opening up still wider to foreign and domestic investors , enlarge the spheres of investment by foreign businessmen , broaden the channel of using foreign capital , make positive use of foreign loans , vigorously develop foreign economic relations and trade , and expand economic and technological exchange and cooperation with various countries in the world including the neighboring countries .  
We should infiltrate scientific and technological progress into various links of the western development , expedite the dissemination of advanced applicable technologies , take great pains to develop a number of industrial technologies of a general character , and lay special stress on developing a number of new high technologies with special characteristics .  The state 's funds for various scientific and technological plans should further slant toward the western region so as to provide powerful support and guarantee for the western development .  
and commercial housing .  In 1999 and 2000 , the state separately issued another 110 billion yuan 's and 150 billion yuan 's worth of long-term construction bonds , and while making arrangements to continue the state bond-funded projects already under construction , some new projects were added .  They included some technological transformation projects in key trades and industries , the installation of Chinese-made equipment in major projects and the industrialization of advanced technologies , some environmental and ecological construction projects , and some educational infrastructure projects .  
As a modern mass media , broadcasting has its unique advantage , as it spreads quickly , is convenient to listen in , and has a wide coverage and a strong appeal .  It has an important influence in our economic , political , scientific and technological , educational and cultural life .  
Township and town enterprises should give prominence to the main theme of development , make effort to create a good public opinion , policy , and legal system environment , grasp the three key points of institutional innovation , structural adjustment , and technological progress , and effectively enhance their overall quality and efficiency .  
Thus , in order to achieve the strategic target for the new century , Hubei can not adopt the " strategy of following others " in its choice of development model .  Instead , it must adopt a strategy of developing by leaps and bounds .  What this means is that in the process of industrialization , it must persist in using an information-based economy to boost industrialization , fully bring into play its advantage in having a late start , and rely on technological leaps to boost leaps in social productivity from a high starting point .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must guide and organize high-tech research and development in the light of the strategic demands of national development and the demands of the market , and effectively promote scientific and technological innovation with a view to achieving our own intellectual property rights in order to develop a high-tech industry that is capable of competing in the international market and developing by leaps and bounds .  
Beijing is strong in the fields of science and technology , personnel , intelligence and information , which form a solid foundation for the development of the high-tech industry .  It must launch a number of major high-tech projects with autonomous intellectual property rights and strive to achieve real breakthroughs in the development of high-tech industry , the promotion of scientific and technological innovation and the training of personnel .  
Although the overall international situation tends to be eased up , the forces of hegemony and power politics still exist .  They rely on their economic and scientific and technological edge to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries and attempt to control the world , thereby threatening world and regional peace and stability .  
Through the implementation of the party 's rural policies and in-depth reforms , we should effectively protect , arouse , and give play to the initiative of the peasants .  This is the main driving force for increasing their income .  At the same time , the advantageous technological and intelligent conditions in the capital should be brought into full play ;  
Giving play to China 's advantage in some resources , especially labor resource , means integrating the structural readjustment with giving play to our advantages and solving our employment problems .  We must and hard on the proper grouping of labor-intensive , capital-intensive , technology-intensive , and knowledge-intensive industries .  On the one hand , we must raise the technological standard of all sectors in the national economy , and on the other hand , we must create more jobs to enable massive shift of the agricultural population to the nonagricultural sectors .  
The theme of the current meeting is to energetically push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution and accelerate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency in a bid to provide scientific and technological support to the agricultural and rural economic development in the new stage .  
A relatively perfect system of agricultural science and education and a system of technology dissemination have been initially instituted , the contingent of scientific and technological personnel has been steadily expanded , the basic research in the agricultural sphere and research on new high technologies have made rapid advances , and some research items have held a leading position in the world .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
Li Lanqing pointed out that since the first national meeting of agricultural science and technology held in 1963 , through the unremitting efforts of the agricultural scientific and technological workers and various sectors , we have basically resolved the technological problems in terms of agricultural quantitative growth at present .  
In the coming 10 to 15 years , we must strive by every possible means to resolve the scientific and technological problems in terms of optimizing agricultural structure , heightening agricultural efficiency , improving rural ecological environment , augmenting international competitive power , and so on to facilitate the fundamental change of agriculture from mainly seeking quantity to stressing quality and efficiency .  
After that , we will take another 10 to 15 years to institute a new-type agricultural scientific and technological innovative system that is suited to China 's agricultural big power status and comes up to the international advanced standards , so that China 's agricultural science and technology will be able to rise to the advanced level in the world .  
and in guiding agricultural scientific and technological development , we should lay emphasis on enhancing the academic level of scientific research , pay more attention to orienting our work to the needs of the markets , and resolve the practical problems in agricultural development .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
It means developing the production of quality farm produce , quickening the pace of developing the processing industry for farm produce , promoting agricultural industrialized operation , optimizing agricultural and rural economic structure , heightening the scientific and cultural level of the vast number of peasants , and broadening the channels to increase peasants ' income through furthering the scientific and technological advancement .  
fully release the initiative and creativity of the scientific and technological personnel , peasants , and enterprises in disseminating agricultural science and technology , adopt the forms of combining the rank of professionals with peasant organizations , combining the leading role of the government and the guiding role of the markets , and combining paid services with gratuitous services , and break a new path of scientific and technological dissemination that tallies with China 's national conditions .  
Third , we need to reform the agricultural scientific and technological management structure , set up an open , mobile , competitive , and coordinated agricultural scientific and technological operational mechanism , and gradually form a new-type management structure suited to the socialist market economic development .  
Personalities assigned to take charge of the scientific and technological work from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , personalities in charge of the departments concerned under the party 's central committee and State Council , principal leaders responsible for the departments of science and technology , agriculture , forestry , and water conservancy from various localities , the commended advanced persons , and some specially invited academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences attended the meeting .  
continually and positively play a role at the non-governmental level ; further push forward political , economic , scientific , technological , cultural , education , sports , and personnel exchanges between our two countries and exchanges or cooperation between our local governments in all fields .  The people of our two countries should push in an all-round way friendship between China and Japan onto a new stage .  
As extensive contacts and in-depth discussions have resulted in deeper understanding and mutual trust , China and India have come up with a consensus on a wide range of issues , including bilateral relations , international issues , political , economic , cultural , scientific , or technological exchanges , exchanges between governments or parliaments , exchanges between political parties and peoples , border issues , good-neighborhood , and so on .  
Wen Jiabao , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , pointed out at the close of the meeting : The Agricultural Technology Development Outline formulated by China at the beginning of the century manifests the requirements of promoting a new agricultural technological revolution put forth by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and is a comprehensive and systematic guideline document guiding China 's agricultural technological development in the future .  
We must regard nurturing of talents as a crucial measure and build an agricultural technology contingent formed by technological leaders , agricultural technology promotion experts , agricultural technology entrepreneurs , high-caliber peasants , and agricultural technology management cadres , thereby promoting independent , healthy , and sustained development of China 's agricultural technology undertakings .  
Proceeding from the internal and external circumstances confronting the country , making development the theme , making structural readjustment the principal line , making the reform and opening up to the outside world as well as scientific and technological advancement the driving forces , and taking the improvement of the people 's living standards as the fundamental starting point , this draft outline gives a magnificent blueprint for the country 's economic and social development over the next five years .  
While talking about Sino-US ties , he said : Last year , Chinese and US leaders conducted a successful meeting .  The two countries have enjoyed smooth economic and trade development .  Bilateral cooperation in scientific , technological , educational , cultural , military , and other aspects has also been continuously strengthened .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
When the issue of the regulation of supply comes up , people often mention tax cuts and accelerated depreciation .  These measures have positive significance for lowering enterprise costs , improving enterprise competitiveness , increasing effective supply , and promoting enterprise development .  Not to be overlooked are support for the enterprises ' technological transformation and other innovation and the readjustment of the supply structure .  
Four senior officials meetings will be held this year .  The upcoming meeting will discuss the economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region , globalization , the new economy , and other issues of common concern .  It also will study , while ensuring the process of APEC 's trade and investment liberalization , how to push forward economic and technological cooperation and carry out regional cooperation in capacity building and exploitation of human resources .  
With development over the years , the organization has established a five-level work mechanism - - informal meeting of APEC leaders , ministerial meeting , senior officials meeting , and the committees and work group and secretariat under senior officials meeting .  The organization 's work involves cooperation in a broad area , including trade and investment liberalization , economic and technological cooperation , and dialogue on macroeconomic policy .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
- - Comprehensively promoting the strategy of " boosting Shandong with science and education , " sticking to the principle of quality education , leading scientific and technical innovation , and industrialization of hi-tech .  Shandong should work hard to attain a new leap in science , technology , and education , and realize the shift of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers to boost economic construction .  
Mutually beneficial cooperation has been carried out and expanded gradually in the economic and trade , scientific and technological , cultural and education , and public health fields , and has achieved positive results .  
At a news conference after the end of the meeting , Wang Guangya said : the senior officials of all participating economic entities unanimously agreed that APEC should advance economic and technological cooperation in the fields of energy construction and human resources while maintaining the momentum of the process of trade and investment liberalization , and should make efforts to start a new round of multilateral trade talks as early as possible on the basis of formulating a balanced agenda .  
Wu Banguo pointed out : Through the joint efforts of large numbers of cadres and workers in the information industry , remarkable achievements were made in such fields as separating government administration from enterprise management , reorganizing telecommunications enterprises , making initial public offerings abroad , improving relevant laws , promoting the building of an information-based economy and society , setting up organizations responsible for the management of computer networks and information security , and tackling difficulty technological problems last year .  
The State Council in 1999 promulgated the " National Scientific and Technological Rewarding Provisions , " reformed the scientific and technological rewarding system , and set up the nation 's highest scientific and technological awards for the excellent and top-notch scientific and technological talents who made outstanding contributions .  
This essential move has enhanced the authority and influence of the national scientific and technological rewards and further embodied the party and the nation 's policies on respecting knowledge and professionals .  This move has also manifested the strong determination and firm confidence of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in implementing the strategy of invigorating the county through science and education and in vigorously promoting the innovations of science and technology .  Hence , this move has already produced and will continue to produce a great and far-reaching influence .  
The new technological revolution , represented by information technology , biotechnology , and nanometer technology , is now profoundly changing the traditional economic structure , production organization , and operational modes and is bringing about a leap in the quality of the development of productive forces .  
The party and state 's ample rewards to scientific and technological personnel and the hard working and enterprising spirit of the awarded scientists will certainly and utterly inspire the national pride and self-confidence of numerous scientific and technological workers as well as the people throughout the country .  This will also encourage the vast numbers of scientific and technological workers to blaze new trials , initiate undertakings , scale the scientific heights of the world , overcome new challenges , and win a new victory .  
Practice has proved that the series of major decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core are correct ; all localities and departments have been effective in implementing the line , principles , and policies of the central authorities ; and the vast numbers of scientific and technological personnel , educational workers , as well as people from all social circles on the united front have made remarkable contribution to the country 's economic development .  
The responsible persons of relevant departments under central and state organs ; the responsible persons of the national committees of all democratic parties , as well as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce ; non-party personages ; and all the representatives attending the national Science and Technology Award-giving rally as well as the representatives of the capital 's scientific and technological circles , totaling more than 3,000 people , attended the report meeting .  
While increasing their traditional commodity trade , the enterprises will also gradually expand economic and technological cooperation and reciprocal investments , and will especially advance their joint-venture cooperation in the high-tech field .  This will not only enhance the level of economic and trade cooperation and enrich the contents of cooperation , but will also bring about greater economic benefits to both sides .  This time , a batch of Chinese entrepreneurs with substantive economic strength joined the visit , and this won good comments from the five host countries .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
The proposal adopted by the CPC Central Committee for formulating the 10th Five-Year Plan disclosed this important information : In the 10th Five-Year Plan period , China will take development as the theme , structural readjustment as the principal line , reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress as a driving force , and improving the people 's living standards as the basic starting point . 
" To take a look at the possible change of a country 's industrial structure , it is necessary mainly to see the speed of its technological changes . "  Lin Yifu commented that the secret of Japan and Asia 's " four small dragons " in making rapid development in the 20th century was to introduce advanced technology .  As for China , it has a tremendous potential in promoting economic growth by making full use of its comparative advantages to introduce advanced technology .  
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
He said that in order to achieve agricultural modernization , it is necessary to increase the technological content of agriculture , make positive efforts to readjust the structure of farm production with the optimization of species , the improvement of quality and the achievement of better performance as the central tasks , energetically foster leading enterprises , and boost the successive performance of agriculture and increase peasants ' income through the promotion of " integration of companies and peasant households , " " farming on order " and other forms .  
Jiangsu must seize this opportunity to implement the strategy of relying on science and education to invigorate the country , energetically develop human resources , and promote scientific and technological progress and innovation in order to turn itself into a province with strong scientific and technological resources and provide a powerful driving force for structural readjustment and economic development .  
In the contemporary world , the new scientific and technological revolution is rapidly forging ahead with great momentum , the trend of economic globalization is also gathering momentum .  Many countries , including developed countries , are speeding up their own reforms mainly by actively promoting industrial restructuring .  They are all trying to seize a more favorable and advantageous position ahead of others by stimulating vigor , enhancing strength , and increasing their international competitive power .  
This will require the enterprises to form , as soon as possible , flexible and effective mechanisms for stimulating their initiative and motivation to develop new technologies and make technological innovations that will win them a favorable position in the competition .  First of all , a breakthrough should be made in the distribution system and the employment system .  Effective incentive mechanisms should be set up to attract talented people to the state-owned enterprises for making technological innovations .  
Fifth , we should more effectively promote and spread major practicable farming techniques , enhance the quality of farm produce and the comprehensive agricultural efficiency , thus providing technological support for restructuring . 
In the vast central and west region , the natural and human resources are abundant , the operational costs are cheap , the domestic markets are huge , and the scientific and technological development and manufacturing industry have also had considerable foundations .  
We should use the information net and other advanced technological means to enhance the level of market management and take further advantage of the competitive strong points of commodity markets , while focusing on cultivating and developing markets for key elements such as capital , technology , and labor , so as to promote the rational flow of the key elements of production .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
We should rely on scientific and technological progress to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and raise the level of sharing information on natural disasters ; we should strengthen agricultural capital construction , with the stress on the building of water conservancy projects in order to effectively increase our ability to prevent and combat flooding ; and we should pay close attention to preventing and fighting drought .  
The department concerned said that the incident broke out after some staff and workers found it impossible to adapt to new production requirements introduced in the wake of the factory 's technological transformation , and learned that the factory had decided to lay them off or divert them to other posts .  
" Independent intellectual property rights must be concentrated on high-tech fields with strategic significance .  We must endeavor to make breakthroughs in some crucial technological fields that have a bearing on the economic lifeline and national security . "  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
The 10th Five-Year Plan proposes that overseas investment capable of exploiting China 's comparative advantages should be encouraged and the domains , channels , and modes of international economic and technological cooperation should be expanded .  
Two years ago , Shen visited the United States as an authoritative Chinese expert in space technology .  In light of the mighty uproar caused by the " Cox Report , " he refuted the report as sheer nonsense from a technological perspective .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .  
We will further popularize advanced and applicable technologies , step up the development of human , scientific , and technological resources , and solve outstanding problems in economic and social development through scientific and technological innovation .  
10 .  In chapter 10 of " promoting scientific and technological progress and renovation and raising sustainable development capabilities , " " provide technical support for industrial structure readjustment " was revised to " provide technical support for industrial structural readjustment , particularly for the upgrading of traditional industries . "  
unswervingly put into practice the strategy of rejuvenating the country with science and technology , give vigorous impetus to scientific and technological innovation and advancement , and earnestly do a good job of the building of the personnel rank to provide powerful driving force for economic development and social progress ;  
The two sides are satisfied with the way their bilateral relations are developing and wish to propel their countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , and cultural arenas to develop to a still higher level .  
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region protects the right to own private property in accordance with law and may , on its own , formulate its economic , trade , monetary , financial , educational , scientific and technological , cultural and sports policies in accordance with law .  It will have independent finances , practise an independent taxation system and be a separate customs territory .  
" By bringing together companies from other economies , researchers in our tertiary institutions and local enterprises with scientific and technological competence , the science park will provide a major impetus for the development of indigenous science and technology-based companies in Hong Kong , " he said , adding that it would also promote technology transfer by attracting overseas investment and enhance regional co-operation in this area .  
This is because we have already found a right road of development suited to China 's national conditions , secured a stable social and political situation , acquired quite a solid material and technological base , and possessed a large market and rich resources , and finally we have 1.2 billion industrious and talented people .  
Proceeding from their actual situation at home and in light of their needs and possibilities , the developing countries should work out effective domestic policies and actively conduct economic restructuring in response to shifting economic and technological trends in the world .  
" China 's technological development dated back to early history , " Mr Tung said .  " Its extensiveness and far-reaching influences are unrivalled , " he said .  Mr Tung believed that this exhibition provided a splendid opportunity for the people of Hong Kong to have a better understanding of the scientific and technological achievements , as well as the diligence , wisdom and creativity of the great scientists and fine craftsmen of ancient China .  
The proposed Film Development Fund would promote innovation by supporting projects aimed at enhancing the industry 's professional and technological capabilities ; stimulating the growth of creative productions ; facilitating the use of advanced special effects techniques ; and improving the skills of employees .  
In addition , the Government will establish an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to provide " mid-stream " research , which is pivotal in linking basic scientific research to its commercial applications ; set up a $ 5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading in the manufacturing and service industries ; establish a $ 5 billion Quality Education Fund for grants to raise school standards through innovation ; and facilitate technology collaboration between academic institutions and the business community .  
These included Japan 's economic recovery packages , financial and corporate sector restructuring , providing a catalyst for private capital flows , economic and technical co-operation , electronic commerce and ways to strengthen human resource development , economic infrastructure and the science and technological base .  
With continued globalisation , infrastructure development will have to be geared towards international economic activities .  Such projects will need to be developed in anticipation of long-term demand to provide the necessary support for sustained growth , as well as the tremendous technological change we expect in the new millennium .  
To strengthen the capability of our private sector in developing innovative ideas for commercial use , I have accepted two key recommendations of the Commission on Innovation and Technology . Firstly , the establishment of an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to support and stimulate mid-stream research .  Secondly , the setting up of an Innovation and Technology Fund of HK $ 5 billion to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading of our manufacturing and service industries .  
This common law rule , which forbids the conviction of a person for homicide if the victim does not die within a year-and-a-day after receiving injury , is now considered to be inappropriate , unnecessary and undesirable , in light of the medical and technological advances in treatment and life support made since the rule was first established . 
I am confident that Hong Kong will remain a most vibrant international city in the 21st century , with advance technological development and a versatile , resilient workforce .  Like this MTR train , we will forge our way ahead with speed and vigour ; and like the Dragon , we will maintain our agility and drive to capture new opportunities that emerge in the new millennium .  Thank you .

At the Meeting , Ministers acknowledged the importance of helping SMEs enhance technological innovation through co-operation , and sharing of information and resources ; access finance through enhancing SMEs ' financial transparency and identifying new financing channels ; and creating a favourable business environment conducive to starting and developing businesses .  
" The Science and Technology subject is an initiative to provide students with a broad and balanced curriculum .  It is particularly valuable to non-science students , providing them with additional learning experiences on modern scientific and technological developments , " he explained .  
It has been reported that as electronic and innovative technological toys have been considered by most toy manufacturers to be the mainstream orders in the coming three years , the Toys Manufacturers ' Association of Hong Kong proposes that the Government set up an " Innovative Toy Design Centre " to upgrade the quality of local toy products .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
We will focus on the development of these niches .  Harnessing our sophisticated infrastructure , robust legal system and intellectual property protection framework , established international business experience and network , and a thriving capital market with high capital raising capability , we will continue to promote the industrialization of research findings and create an enabling environment for further technological advancement .  
" Due to our ageing population , rapid technological advances and increasing community aspiration , our public health care system is suffering from an intensive financial pressure as the cost to maintain it has been increasing swiftly and there is concern on whether the system 's long-term financial sustainability can be maintained . 
Given the department 's proven ability to adapt and manage changes , a good technological base , and highly motivated and hardworking staff in the office , Mr Jones is confident that the CR could achieve its vision by establishing , by early 2005 , a fully computerized " world-class " Companies Registry which provides a significantly enhanced level of facilities and services , both quantitatively and qualitatively , to its customers .  
Accordingly , we started an internal review in 2001 and , in the light of operating experience , international e-business development and technological advancement , drew up a set of preliminary proposals for public consultation in early 2002 .  
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
The National Science Council , under the Executive Yuan , has established a " Scientific and Technological Information Center " in Taipei , to meet the needs of national economic construction and to serve better the industrial and academic worlds . The main tasks of the center include providing information service , collection of documents , coordination and communication and technological evaluation .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
Doctors rarely engage in basic research work , it was pointed out . Furthermore , while there is a great deal of advanced technological equipment , there is a lack of people qualified to use it . The Republic of China 's standing in medical organizations was threatened a few years ago by political factors .  
It involves many complicated factors and to single out one country as the culprit is unfair . Many companies feel they are the victims says one official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs , but the real damage is done to the country as a whole . The goal of economic upgrading and technological progress will be thwarted if this belief persists .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Through this method the level of industrial technology increased and a large sum of capital accumulated which was necessary for research . At the same time it also served to nurture technological talent laying down the foundation for the rapid economic growth of the sixties .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
This has received attention because : ( a ) The proportion of the elderly in the population has increased ; they hope to continue to study and fill out their lives . ( b ) People demand satisfaction in their spiritual lives as the standard of living rises . ( c ) Constant technological change requires opportunities for continuing education .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
Something worth mentioning is that with new military equipment largely automated and technological , future manpower needs will be reduced , which eases the problem that has been caused for the navy by the shortened term of naval conscription .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
To each his strengths : Before economic reforms were implemented on the mainland , emphasis was placed on " standing on one 's own feet . " Hence , scientists were cut off from information about foreign technology and were forced to grope around in the dark . Yet in this way we gained some technological development experience , especially in a few specialized areas .  
I personally believe that what scientific and technological development in Taiwan lacks is precisely the kind of planning in which national policy is based on multifaceted considerations . Here it mostly seems to be that a professor or school puts forward a goal that suits his or its particular strengths . For example , the recent relatively major plans to develop satellites , aerospace and astronomy , seem to have been embarked upon after hearing just a few people 's suggestions .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Broadly speaking , the work of the ITRI can be divided into two main areas . The first is that of accepting commissions from government units ( especially the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) which directs industrial technological development ) . This includes taking on topical special technology development projects , along with generalities such as assisting in upgrading plans for traditional industries .  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
While warfare provided partial impetus for the invention of ingenious new weaponry , " the emergence of the wooden ox was no historical accident , " asserts Wang Jian , conveying his enthusiasm for the history of Chinese mechanical science . " It was just one among a series of technological inventions . " During the Spring and Autumn period the brilliant craftsman Lu Ban created an unusual carriage for his mother , driven by a wooden figure .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
Whether or not legislation is passed , perhaps in the end it will still be a matter for individual choice and conscience , and the new issues created by modern technological " solutions " by which humans seek to " overcome nature , " such as human cloning , cryogenics and so on , will continue to constantly force mankind to search for still more comprehensive and precisely formulated social rules , and will forever push " evolution " to new heights .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
According to First International Computers ' Jeff Hsue , who has also traveled to the States himself to interview applicants , Taiwan 's ability to design and produce products is hard to beat . But he says that few Taiwanese firms are involved in taking product design to a higher level , whether it be through technological developments , preliminary research or even fundamental academic research , because of the difficulties and risks involved .  
Following technological advances in the fishing industry , the worldwide consumption of seafood rose and then peaked at 100 million tons in 1990 . The UN 's Food and Agriculture Organization has stated that one-fourth of the sea creatures that constitute the world 's top 20 sources of seafood are already suffering from severe overfishing , requiring cuts in total yearly hauls of 30% .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
In defiance of the stereotypes that many have about those who are hard of hearing , the " Beyond the Summit Leadership Camp for the Hearing-Impaired " was developed and planned by people who are hearing-impaired themselves . Emphasizing scientific and technological training , it employs simultaneous interpretation as well as the virtual technologies of the Internet to help the hearing-impaired create a realm where there are no obstacles to communication .  
From the 1950s , after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan , Li served in such posts as chairman of the Industrial Development Commission , economic affairs minister and minister of finance , charting Taiwan 's economic , financial and technological development policies with bold vision . His emphasis on creating a favorable investment environment and cultivating new talent brought to Taiwan an unending flow of development projects , and earned him respect as Taiwan 's " Father of Technological Development " and " Architect of the Economic Miracle . "  
Over the past 50 years , no other individual has been appointed to ministerial posts overseeing all three areas of economic , financial and technological development affairs . During his long tenure guiding economic and financial policy , he nearly single-handedly planted the seeds for the development of Taiwan 's information industry .  
While he dedicated his life 's work to economic and technological development , he did not forget the importance of raising educational standards , narrowing the gap between urban and rural citizens and controlling population growth , and these were not overlooked in the promotion of his new ideas .  
Lee Shan-ren of the Taiwan Agriculture Strategy Coalition , remembers a ' 70s television program entitled Provisional Government Mailbox which specialized in answering problems encountered by farmers . " Technological developments in Taiwan 's agriculture have never ceased to move forward , " says Lee . With its myriad technological breakthroughs , agricultural testing institutions , experimental farms , fishery testing institutions , and private enterprises , Taiwan is one of the best in the research and development of new agricultural strains .  
It 's not a listed company and its founders are n't well known members of Taiwan 's technological aristocracy . Nevertheless , it has won the Ministry of Economic Affair 's " Symbol of Excellence Award " for seven years running by pursuing its own strategy of integrating the up - , mid - , and downstream segments of the sensor industry and establishing a firm market base .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
The mainland is a massive country , and the distance between urban areas is huge . Profits from distribution and retailing of books and magazines are small , even though the ' planned economy ' is gradually being dismantled , and soon it will be far too difficult to set up a wide-ranging logistics and shipping network . Because of this , some publishers are choosing not to sell through bookstores , instead looking for an alternative way , facing their own technological difficulties on the way .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
head of the chinese delegation told xinhua that " the exhibition is a window aiming at promoting the mutual understanding between china and indonesia , increasing the exchange between scientific and technological as well as industrial circles of our two countries , and seeking channels of cooperation to achieve common development "  
he said that china is willing to + expand the sino australian cooperation in political , economic , scientific and technological and cultural fields + in line with the principle of mutual respect , equality and mutual benefit , opening up to each other and common prosperity  
China EU relations have shown good momentum in recent years thanks to joint efforts , he said Leaders of the two sides have had frequent contacts , and political dialog and consultation have been fruitful , and cooperation in economic , trade , scientific , technological and other areas has expanded  
China 's abundant resources , cheap labor , sound industrial and technological foundation , advancing legal system , and the rapidly growing economy , make itself an ideal investment spot , and a broad market for the Belgian enterprises , the Vice Premier pointed out  
finally , kohl stressed that enhanced relations with asia will " serve germany 's basic political and economic interests " he called on the economic , scientific and technological circles to take an active part in the asia plan  
He noted that the maintaining of a long term and in depth exchange of contacts between the two countries is conducive to the promotion of bilateral educational , scientific and technological development , and beneficial to the advancement of bilateral friendly relations oriented towards the 21st century  
Shen said that protecting IPR and rigorously cracking down on IPR infringements are the requirement of China 's own reform and opening up , its economic growth and scientific and technological advancement The tremendous efforts and remarkable achievement China has made in this regard are universally acknowledged  
" We stand ready to work with the Pakistani side to vigorously carry out economic and technological cooperation and people to people exchanges in various forms so as to lay a more solid foundation for a long term , steady and all round development of our bilateral ties , " he said  
on specific projects in bilateral economic and technological cooperation , li expressed his hope that departments concerned of the two sides will , on the basis of equality and mutual benefits , continue their negotiations and try to reach agreements on some projects with ripe conditions  
Peng , vice chairperson of the Chinese National People 's Congress ( NPC ) Standing Committee , said China and Norway have witnessed growing cooperation in economic , cultural , scientific and technological and environmental protection affairs since the forging of their diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago  
due to the international sanctions , yugoslavia 's cross border transportation , trade , and inflows of foreign capital and technology have all been cut off , forcing a large number of researchers to go abroad and paralyzing the country 's scientific and technological research system  
As for science and education in construction , China has achieved 124 scientific and technological research results , which are up to advanced international level And a total of nearly 480,000 personnel have received education in the construction departments of various colleges and schools nationwide  
In his written statement upon arrival at Jakarta Airport , Wang Hanbin expressed his satisfaction over the development of bilateral relations , especially the exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the economic , scientific , technological and cultural fields since the resumption of diplomatic ties seven years ago  
Ma also expressed sincere solicitude to the relatives of the deceased , saying that Pfrang Jurgen Hermann was highly appreciated by relevant Chinese departments because of his positive efforts and major contributions to Sino German economic and technological cooperation over the years  
he added that local border trade with the former soviet union also developed rapidly last year , the province achieved 1-07-billion swiss francs in border trade with the former soviet union , a 48 percent increased over 1990 in addition , the province 's economic and technological cooperation and labor export increased by a big margin  
However , it was observed that developing countries were facing exceptional difficulties in reaching compatible levels of technological development , without which effective and widespread regional science and technology cooperation could not occur .  
In order to achieve the required level of services , enhanced coordination and technological innovation were indispensable , but equally essential was the provision of adequate human and material resources .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .  
Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
These may be times of vertiginous political and technological change , but we sometimes feel discouraged at the persistence of tenacious negative aspects of the human condition rooted in selfishness and in the darkest chapters of our history .  
Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
In a growing number of countries , the private sector has or is fast developing the financial , managerial and technological capacity to carry out a vast array of such activities in an effective and costefficient manner .  
As emphasized particularly by industrial organization explanations of FDI , TNCs generally enjoy specific competitive advantages based on their superior proprietary technological and organizational capacities .  
A decentralized , regionbyregion approach to international cooperation in pursuing science and technology for sustainable development is sometimes warranted by regional differences in local conditions and patterns of economic and technological activities .  
However , it was pointed out that as a result of the increased demand for " cartographic products " , governmentfunded national surveys had a bright future , subject to good leadership , adaptation to technological advances and increased financial selfreliance .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
At the international level , the required actions go well beyond the socalled technological fix , although new technologies based on the latest scientific understanding will be vitally important , as will the revival or upgrading of indigenous technologies .  
With a downward trend in global military spending and an increased reliance upon lighter arms in situations of actual conflict , the technological base for more sophisticated weapon systems is getting narrower .  
The concept of security in the postcoldwar period was becoming more complex ; in addition to political security , it also included economic , environmental , social and scientific and technological security .  
In yet another move to keep pace with the latest technological developments , the Department will make the time-consuming process of audio / visual editing as simple as word processing and will develop a future tapeless archival system that is fully networked and capable of almost instantaneous delivery of the Department 's products world wide .  
At the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium , in a world characterized by a globalization of the economy and the dynamics of international relations , our reality is conditioned by factors such as the substantial progress of science , the transcendence of the technological revolution , the decisive influence of communications and information , the expansion of trade and the consequences of cultural and religious interaction .  
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
As rightly observed and recognized , young people in all countries are both a major human resource for development and key agents for social change , economic development and technological innovation .  
Ukraine considers that one of the possible ways to obtain an objective analysis of and to solve the problems connected with the Chernobyl accident would be to set up an international technological research centre which would deal with issues related to the elimination of the consequences of nuclear radiological accidents and in whose work leading experts from various countries in the world could participate .  
The principles enshrined in the declaration , and developed and refined in the course of three ministerial meetings of countries from the zone , have been maintained unchanged : a pacifist spirit that corresponds to the aspirations of the States that compose the zone ; the quest for the best forms of cooperation in the different areas and , in particular , in the scientific , technological , political and cultural spheres ; and a commitment to democracy and the promotion of fundamental human rights .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
In this context , our delegation notes with satisfaction the significant activity of major donor countries and of the international financial organizations , primarily the World Bank , to provide scientific , expert and technological assistance to the Palestinian people to tackle tasks related to the need to improve their social and economic conditions rapidly , strengthen institutions of self-government , establish a financial and banking system , and train highly qualified national personnel .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Strengthening and establishing national advisory groups on environmental and developmental ethics , in order to develop a common value framework between the scientific and technological community and society as a whole , and promote continuous dialogue ;  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
Criticisms of the concept of carrying capacity have pointed out that it does not adequately account for the potential impact of technological change , aspirations for higher standards of living , possibilities for and effects of international trade , and institutional , social , economic and political constraints on land use and production . 
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
Encouraging the production of relevant studies / research to assess the consequences of global and technological changes on social integration and the production of evaluations of the policies and programmes put in place to achieve the various components of social integration ; and encouraging national and international exchanges and dissemination of information on innovative models and successful practices ;  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such technical advisory panel ( s ) as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
Future decision-makers must be trained to take an interdisciplinary approach that spans the environmental , social , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological advance .  
This is based on the need to train future decision-makers to take an interdisciplinary approach to the promotion of technology by evaluating the environmental , sociological , cultural , economic and ethical implications of technological innovation and implementation .  
Poverty is a multidimensional , complex situation that has economic , educational , social , political , cultural and technological dimensions .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
Major constraints being experienced by the countries include , in particular , a drastic decline in financial resources to adequately maintain the various valuable scientific and technological infrastructures and , of increasing concern , the critical reduction in the scientific workforce in bioscience and biotechnology .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
In the fifth subparagraph , after the words " an effective commitment to global , coordinated action " , add the words : " on mitigating and overcoming the consequences of natural disasters and major technological and anthropogenic catastrophes , such as that at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and their like , as well as on . . . " ;  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
Efforts will also be directed to incorporating the secretariat into a regional network linking the main national research centres on industrial restructuring and competitiveness to conduct comparative and overall analyses on the experiences in designing industrial and technological development strategies .  
The resource growth is attributable to ( a ) acquisition of the specialized automation equipment required for development of local area network in the Department under the responsibility of the Information Support Unit ( $ 55,000 ) , and ( b ) additional requirements for replacement of existing equipment of the Department under the global programme of technological innovations ( $ 113,900 ) .  
In addition , ongoing technological innovations over the years have imposed an extraordinary burden on the mechanical and electrical support systems , which are now operating at full capacity , making them inadequate and inefficient and resulting in higher energy consumption and increased utility costs .  
The main objectives of the association are to further economic integration , develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea and strengthen functional cooperation in the political , cultural , scientific , social and technological areas .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
A strategy for transformation of education and training institutions is proposed , which reduces their isolation from the cutting edges of scientific and technological change , improves articulation between the supply of and demand for human resources through better understanding of systems of production , and acknowledges the crucial intersectoral links between the economy and society at both individual and collective levels .  
The unique character of the Congress , in which the participants combined political leverage and expertise , and which served as a forum for the world-wide sharing of knowledge , exchange of experience and transfer of technological know-how , has been widely recognized , and its productive results were emphasized both at the Congress and at the Commission 's subsequent session . 
We are firmly committed to initiating a new era in the Caribbean region characterized by the strengthening of integration , concerted action and consultation in order to ensure greater cultural , economic , political , scientific , social and technological cooperation among our peoples , Governments and countries ;  
Croatia 's views stem from its geo-strategic position and its political , economic , technological and cultural features , and are thus closely linked to its long-term strategic interests , including a political settlement to the crisis in the region as a precondition for democratic and independent development .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
Achieving technological dynamism is therefore a major objective and challenge facing all countries .  To this end , parallel to individual country efforts , inter-country or cross-country initiatives are taking shape in the interest of efficiency and dynamic complementarities that achieve economies of scale and broaden the scope of innovative activities , particularly where the critical level of resources is not readily available .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
On a strategic and policy level , the Union 's supreme organ , the Plenipotentiary Conference , meeting at Kyoto in October 1994 , set out its strategic plan for 1995-1999 in resolution 1 of which it considers the subject in the context of the rapidly changing telecommunication environment under three broad headings : restructuring of the telecommunication sector , technological convergence , and globalization .  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
There is much potential for further sweeping changes and geographical shifts in the loci of production , as the developing countries adapt to technological advances , especially large countries with a latent export potential , and as the economies in transition begin to expand , especially those situated in proximity to major world markets .  
Within the framework of ECLAC / UNDP regional project RLA / 88 / 039 , entitled " Design of policies to strengthen the capacity for technological innovation and enhance international competitiveness in the Latin American entrepreneurial environment " , ECLAC and SELA officials held meetings to analyse the possibilities for cooperation in identifying and describing the current status of industrial policy in various countries in the region .  
Major pharmaceutical firms and suppliers of medical equipment and medical equipment spare parts , which had historically maintained trade links with Cuba , recently informed the Cuban authorities officially that since their products either contained United States components or were manufactured under United States technological licences which were affected by the ban imposed by the United States federal authorities , it was impossible to proceed with the deliveries .  
It is increasingly apparent that the world Organization finds itself working in a new communications age defined by rapidly changing political environments , equally swift technological developments , unprecedented budget pressures on major contributing countries , and the rising power and world-wide reach of the media .

Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
NULLIn the light of those findings , the Working Group , in its general conclusions , confirmed that efforts towards promoting technology transfer and technological capability-building in developing countries and countries in transition need to be coupled with market-based trade and investment policy and pricing systems , and with a stable macroeconomic environment for business activity conducive to overall economic growth and employment . 
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
The Division is responsible for establishing policies for environmentally sound and sustainable multi-sectoral development plans , the integration of environmental imperatives into the development process , the development of energy and natural resources and the reduction of natural disasters , taking into account technological and economic and demographic development .  
NULLIn recent years , the frequency and magnitude of major disasters , whether of a natural , technological or ecological origin , have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
In parallel , UNIDO is preparing a manual for self-diagnosis of critical technological needs for sustained competitiveness at the plant level , the core of which could be applied to all developing countries .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
There is danger that , due to scientific / technological backwardness , the Federal Republic may experience a period of " ecologic blockade " after the sanctions are lifted , because its economy will not be ready to meet the demands of the markets of developed countries who are the Republic 's main trade partners .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In keeping with Iraq 's former position that the political decision had not been made to proceed to the design , development and production of nuclear weapons , the purpose of this work had previously been explained as technological development with the long-term possibility of converting to metal the depleted uranium , expected to result from Iraq 's indigenous enrichment processes , as part of a waste management strategy .  
At the time of this reorganization , the head of the First Group had expressed his conviction that , although considerable promise of success was evident in the production of diffusion barriers , the technological content of the entire gaseous diffusion process was likely to be beyond Iraq 's short-term capabilities and had suggested that the gas centrifuge enrichment process was worthy of attention .  
stressed the need for strengthened international cooperation which should be reflected in appropriate financial and technological resources to enable developing countries to implement their national plans .  
Mr . RUDENSKY ( Russian Federation ) said that the problem of human settlements , which encompassed social , economic , industrial , technological , administrative and environmental aspects , had taken on a global dimension .  
With regard to the subprogrammes on food and agriculture , economic and social planning , industrial , scientific and technological development , international trade and development finance , natural resources and energy , and social development , it would be misleading to state that any of them duplicated work done by other bodies and that ECLAC should not be involved in such activities .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Secondly , at the policy level there is a systematic programme to make public administrators aware of the profound economic and technological changes sweeping the world , and of their implications for the country 's development .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and its safety can no longer be assured in a world characterized by abject poverty , external debt burdens , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , increasing violence and discrimination , crimes and drug use .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
This reorganization of the international system on the basis of strategic economic objectives has been accompanied by a scientific and technological revolution , a revolution of knowledge that spread across the planet and brought about the most profound change ever experienced in the history of humankind , turning the world into one large neighbourhood .  
Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network ( comprising telecommunications and television , the Mir manned orbital station , space research and technological development , navigational safety , tracking of vessels in distress , topographic geodesy and cartography , and remote sensing of the Earth ) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability , further developing science and technology , improving the country 's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Conscious of the forthcoming tenth anniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which became the largest technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
Although there was a growing interest in mobile communications , their development would depend on the evolution of important factors , such as technological progress , the availability of orbital positions ( for geostationary satellites ) , spectral bandwidths , costs and performance to satisfy a wide range of applications and the capability to provide truly global services .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
Parties to the Protocol on Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) , not yet in force , are also expected , as a second step , to negotiate further measures to reduce VOC emissions or their transboundary fluxes and their resulting secondary photochemical oxidant products , taking into account , inter alia , the best available scientific and technological developments , scientifically determined critical levels and internationally accepted target levels , as well as the role of nitrogen oxides in the formation of photochemical oxidants .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .  
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .  
Concerning the definition of an aerospace object , while we agree generally with question 1 , which considers the twofold capacity to travel and to fly into orbit as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object , we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology , and therefore we advise , in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution , to thoroughly examine the aerospace object requisites . 
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
Recent rapid developments in telecommunication services had brought an increasing demand for spectrum / orbit usage , raising the possibility of substantial changes in allocation practices , due among other things to technological progress and the increasing use of space techniques in radio communications and to political , social and structural changes and the resulting liberalization of telecommunication services .  
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
Conduct research on the effects of the internationalization and globalization of economies , including technological change , on men 's and women 's employment , including changing international work patterns , and publish the findings for use in policy formulation and advocacy ; continue research on occupational segregation and on unequal pay for men and women ; assess the gender dimension of structural adjustment through country studies ; document the impact of policy reforms on women , based on household surveys ; conduct case-studies on the role and contribution of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Create awareness among policy makers of women 's role in the conservation and regeneration of natural resources , including access to the required legal , scientific and technological means , and of their participation in environmental research by documenting and promoting women 's indigenous knowledge base ; advocate the increase of women 's participation and their perspectives in environment , science and technology research , policy and programmes , and more ethical science and technology ( UNIFEM , DAW / DPCSD , UNEP , Division for Science and Technology / UNCTAD , ECE , UNICEF ) .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .  
Finally , a sixth objective is to respond to the expressed need of the international community for the annual consideration , review and evaluation of continuing developments related to the law of the sea and ocean affairs in the General Assembly through the monitoring and analysis of and reporting on developments relating to the law of the sea and ocean affairs , including legal , political , economic , technological and scientific developments .  
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
Developments in public administration have been influenced in recent years by fundamental changes , including technological advances , global economic interdependence , aggravation of social problems and the growing importance of the private sector .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
The organization shall be concerned with matters falling within the competence of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies with respect to international economic , social , environmental , cultural , educational , health , scientific , technological and related matters and to humanitarian and human rights questions .  
To ensure that the proper mix of permanent , temporary and contractual staff and adequate technological resources are available so that documentation produced in all six official languages is of high quality and is issued in a timely fashion , in strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the various bodies and organs of the United Nations ;  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Industry remains a vital instrument for economic and social progress , facilitating employment generation , contributing fundamentally to productivity growth and technological change , enabling the creation of dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors , and contributing to foreign-exchange earnings .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
The commonly accepted definition of a standard is the result of well-reasoned collective choice designed to serve as the basis of understanding for the solution of recurring problems ; a standard represents a balance between the requirements of users and workers and between the technological and social possibilities of these two groups and the public interest which the authorities must safeguard .  
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
Cancelled : ( ii ) role and implications of macroeconomic policies for promotion of regional economic cooperation ; ( viii ) one issue on new and innovative ways to develop and strengthen industrial and technological skills : and ( x ) one issue on technology indicators and directories of selected research and development institutions , experts and technologies .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Given the many areas where there is a mutual interest in government-private sector cooperation , including , for example , skills , technological and infrastructure development , environmental protection and the promotion of inter-firm backward and forward linkages , the ability of the Government and the private sector to build up a confident and effective working relationship with each other assumes a particular importance .  
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
To achieve its goals in this area , UNCTAD uses to its maximum extent the leverage of the information technology paradox : contrary to previous technological revolutions , which have largely concentrated economic power and competitiveness in a handful of capital-rich and technology-intensive national economies , the information revolution has made strategic technologies and information much more affordable , even for the smaller players . 
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;

In this regard , I would like to emphasize that the Palestinian people can count on the support of Ukraine which , with its considerable scientific and technological potential , stands ready to develop dynamic Ukrainian-Palestinian cooperation in the economic sphere , in particular in the sectors of housing and capital construction , water supply , education and training . 
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
The Trade and Development Report had gone beyond the traditional argument put forward by the World Bank in various respects : first , by emphasizing the need to establish a dynamic interaction between exports and investment ; secondly , by showing the importance of mobilizing and making full use of natural resources and abundant , unskilled labour and of continuously upgrading industries and moving up the technological ladder ; and thirdly , by pointing to the challenges for government policies involving new forms of intervention to support a dynamic process of development .  
Among other things , the committee is endeavouring to lay down the main principles for reconciling technological progress in these fields with ethical and legal standards , human values , human rights and social , economic and cultural realities .  
However , since special arrangements regulating the diversity of such objects do not exist in the applicable international law and considering probable future technological developments in this area , a single and unified regime does not seem legally necessary at this stage .  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

During that event , more than 140 leading media figures from around the globe , representing more than 50 countries , had discussed the growing significance of television in the changing contemporary world , the opportunities offered by the current technological revolution in communications , which vastly increased the possibilities of cultural exchange , the role of both private and public broadcasters in providing information on global events and the strengthening of the partnership between the United Nations system and the international media .  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies , financial and other resources and an enabling environment .  
Despite the economic and technological difficulties it faced , Colombia had introduced sweeping legislative , institutional and administrative reforms for environmental protection .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
The scope for female employment has been rapidly expanded by technological change , increasing concentration of employment in service industries , increased flexibility of work times and availability of part-time work , changing social attitudes towards female employment , and improved provision of childcare .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
They also expressed their concern that technological developments in the field of communication , including computer networks such as Internet , can potentially be used for the dissemination of racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic propaganda , the main victims of which are , inter alia , racial , ethnic , national , linguistic and religious minorities .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
Overall , the growing political awareness of the importance of information , the globalization of information content and accessibility , technological changes in the areas both of telecommunications and of information technologies , social trends such as public participation and popular demand for information , and support from major groups , the United Nations system , and other intergovernmental and international organizations have all had an impact on the phenomenal progress made in the area of the accessibility of information through electronic means .  
This involves improving competitiveness in telecommunications , continuing with the technological development of Earth observation , developing advanced scientific instrumentation , carrying out work in orbital infrastructures and acquiring techniques for future launchers .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
It will comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention .  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
At its fifty _ third session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1997 / 71 , entitled Human rights and bioethics , requested the Sub _ Commission , under the agenda item Human rights and scientific and technological developments , to consider ways of ensuring that the life sciences develop in a manner respectful of human rights and beneficial to humanity as a whole and to make recommendations to that effect .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The Conference has been recognized as a forum for technical cooperation , technology transfer and programme coordination for the countries of the Americas region , providing government officials , planners , scientists and experts from the Americas and elsewhere with an opportunity to address common needs , problems and experiences in the field of surveying and mapping , cartography , hydrography , remote sensing , and land and geographical information systems , including educational and training aspects , scientific and technological requirements , implementation issues and benefits . 
While contemporary terrorism does seem a particularly novel and dangerous threat , for it possesses attributes which set it apart from its historical forebears and make it more effective as a result of the confluence of new political circumstances and modern technological advances , it still remains an imitative mode of behaviour with a limited tactical repertoire 9 / and deplorable , as ever , effects on human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Many of the structural constraints that have frustrated the response of the economy to the new policy initiatives , such as weak technological capacity , lack of entrepreneurial and managerial skills and inadequate physical infrastructure , have to be tackled systematically .  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
The Parties shall promote the maintenance and development , on a mutually advantageous basis , of productive and scientific and technological cooperation between economic agents , particularly in the development and production of modern goods employing advanced technology , including items for defence needs , through , inter alia , the formulation of comprehensive inter-State and intersectoral cooperation programmes .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
As the economic basis of security , all countries and regions should , on the basis of equality and mutual benefit , promote trade , economic and technological cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges among themselves , with a view to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and achieving common prosperity and development .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
However , these improvements would remain transitory and frail unless accompanied by policies at both the national and the international levels favourable to strong institutional and technological capacity-building .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
With regard to migration , that extremely complex phenomenon was linked to many demographic , social , ecological , psychological , historical and technological factors .  
Prevention and preparedness strategies , based on scientific and technological applications as well as on social equity , and including the full involvement of civil society , must be put in place to protect national assets and property and especially to reduce human suffering , the loss of life , and the disruption of livelihoods .  
The secretariat convened five international expert working groups to study aspects of early-warning as they relate to geological hazards , hydrometeorlogical hazards including drought , technological hazards , the use and transfer of modern technology , and national and local capabilities pertinent to early-warning .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
We are seeking to build a modern society capable of accompanying the world on its march forward and of assimilating scientific and technological information ; a society aware of the challenges of our time and working to meet those challenges .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
The peaceful advance of humankind and its secure livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , an external debt burden , a growing technological and economic gap between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases , and so on .  
The profound and rapid changes we are witnessing at the international level prompt us to think collectively about the future of our peoples and the importance that should be given to dialogue and consultation in a world that , thanks to technological progress and massive international exchanges , has become a true global village .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
Sustained capital inflows and long-term growth , however , also require continuous upgrading of domestic technological and productive capabilities , for comparative advantage shifts within and between countries and can not be maintained based simply on static comparative advantage and outward-oriented liberalization policies .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Takes note of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ;  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
A solid legal and contractual basis is being established for Russian-Ukrainian interaction in the political , economic , scientific and technological and humanitarian fields .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
This paved the way to military and non _ military approaches to security : peace and security seen not only from a military standpoint but also from that of various disciplines , i.e . technological , legal , economic , political , psychological , religious and environmental .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
Striking a balance of information priorities continued to be a problem in the work of the United Nations : there was too much emphasis on the technological aspects of the consequences of the accident , the question of nuclear power plant safety and concern for the future of the nuclear power industry , with less attention devoted to the medical and environmental repercussions of the disaster , the main burden of which was borne by Belarus .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
COPUOS should play a greater role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , strengthening the international legal order in space , stimulating scientific and technological progress in the developing countries and helping them to share in the spin-off benefits of space technology .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
The content and application of competition law and policy , and its relationship with industrial and trade policies , have varied among different countries at different times , as countries have sought with mixed success to promote the technological capacity and international competitiveness of their industries , compensate for the effects of market failures or ease structural adjustment .  
Any balanced approach to development must take into account current economic , political and technological realities , especially the increasing influence of the private sector , which played a catalytic role in Malaysias economic growth .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the full , open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific , technological , technical , socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change , and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies , including through the establishment of relevant mechanisms for this purpose in the subsidiary bodies of the Convention .  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
He said that an understanding of the basic underlying technology of the Internet was essential , as the technological limitations and the possibilities of the Internet shaped potential public policy options .  
The overall technological capabilities required to develop in the ultraviolet domain an orbital telescope 2 metres in size , with image quality in the range of 0.5 arcsec , could be envisioned as a project of limited costs ;  
The project focuses on the nature of the private investment decisions of southern European manufacturing firms required to incorporate technological change in the transition to sustained and competitive growth in the single European market .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
Developing the capability to understand and predict the social and economic impact of existing practices ( technological , social , economic and cultural ) that might be detrimental to future generations and national economic / social systems ;  
Natural hazards have thus been defined as extreme geophysical events , biological processes and major technological accidents , characterized by concentrated releases of energy or materials that pose a largely unexpected threat to humans .  
Russia , and most of the other countries with transition economies , possessed a developed industrial , scientific and technological base , now operating under difficult transitional conditions .  
With the combined technological advances in molecular biology and rapid sequence reading by computers , scientists are able to identify unique genetic data in human DNA from the collection of hair , blood , tissue , mucous membrane and saliva samples .  
The Board recognized the threat posed by rapid technological innovation in future warfare and was keen on pursuing some of the consequent policy implications for the United Nations system .  
A comprehensive , integrated yet flexible approach is required in order to explore the developmental opportunities of ageing , as they combine with the technological and cultural transitions of our time .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
Member States in eastern Europe should be encouraged to actively cooperate and participate in the international scientific and technological research programmes on the International Space Station , as their involvement could provide major economic and social benefits for the region .

Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
During the biennium 20002001 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In this connection , UNIDO has combined its unique technical and sectoral expertise with technical cooperation provided by other multilateral and bilateral agencies to enhance technological upgrading of industry and facilitate the adoption of production processes consistent with new global standards for quality , cleaner production and energy efficiency in small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) .  
This will reinforce existing South / South networks and create opportunities for experts to learn from rapid substantive and technological changes in the field of statistics ; strengthen regional capability to produce analytical reports ; improve the ability of national institutions to produce relevant statistics ; and ensure capability to share information and results .  
In reviewing items 8 ( a ) - ( c ) , special attention will be paid to the scientific and technological developments that have taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular developing countries , with regard to global , regional and national issues .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
In many developing countries , low levels of technological accumulation point to a need for an overhaul of the educational system in order to incorporate basic technical and business education which will serve as a basis for either on-the-job training by firms or formal industry-wide education .  
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .  
This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .

Countries today , especially developing countries , need to be capable of assimilating technological progress through an understanding of the present and its projection into the future , by formulating appropriate strategies to close the technology gap with the more advanced nations and thus avoid being overtaken by events .  
In industrialized countries too , with an increasing interdependency between information , complex technological facilities , human systems and hazards , there is now the potential for catastrophic failures on a global basis , as the example of the year 2000 computer problem has demonstrated .  
On the one hand , changes in the need for disaster reduction will be determined by the changing patterns of natural hazards , their future potential for association with technological disasters or political conflicts , and shifts in the socio-economic and demographic trends .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .

Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
We shall adopt and implement policy measures at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels aimed at reducing the vulnerability of our societies to both natural and technological hazards through proactive rather than reactive approaches .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
Special attention needs to be given to improving the understanding of the interdependence of foreign direct investment , domestic investment , technological change and technology flows , the policies and practices of multinational firms and the evolution of corporate governance .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .  
His countrys scientific and technological potential and its understanding of the need for coordination with similar activities in Western Europe made it an excellent base for the setting up of a mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of institutions in Central and Eastern Europe in formulating programmes and projects geared to achieving environmentally sustainable development .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Governments are invited to intensify their efforts to create an enabling environment , including stable macroeconomic policies , a coherent and flexible regulatory framework that encourages free competition , efficient physical infrastructure and the necessary improvement in education and human resource development in order to promote SME upgrading and business and technological capability development .  
The interaction between population ageing and development is a complex fusion of global patterns in labour and capital markets , government pensions , services , and traditional support systems , which are further shaped by technological change and cultural transformations .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
Considerable advances have been achieved in the last five decades in social and economic development , including disease eradication , massive immunization programmes , improved agricultural productivity , increased adult literacy rates , improved sanitation and water systems , and technological advances for production and communication .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .  
Questions have arisen as to whether such exclusive arrangements with limited membership have been truly effective in achieving their stated purpose of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime , especially with regard to scientific and technological applications connected with advanced weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Those constraints included , inter alia , the lack of linkages within and between productive , service and infrastructural sectors , insufficiently developed human resources , shortcomings in production related to technological capability and adaptive research , deficiencies in physical infrastructure and support services , and the inability of LDCs to generate adequate resources to alleviate those constraints .  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communication , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity , for promoting racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred , as well as the collection of funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world , Having considered the report submitted by the Secretary-General7 within the framework of the implementation of the Programme of Action ,  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
In a context of economic , political and social globalization and an unprecedented technological revolution , half a century after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , it was inconceivable that some countries should be unwilling to fulfil their commitments in that connection .  
Conscious of the long-term nature of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , which was a major technological catastrophe in terms of its scope and created humanitarian , environmental , social , economic and health consequences and problems of common concern , requiring for their solution wide and active international cooperation and coordination of efforts in this field at the international and national levels ,

The United Nations must provide some direction in the debate on the complex issues surrounding royalties for genetic material , and should help to fashion an international technological architecture that encouraged technological advances , but not at the cost of marginalizing the poorest and most vulnerable .  
In the modern world , the development of national scientific and technological capacities was essential for increasing the competitiveness of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition and ensuring their real integration into the world economic system .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Mr . Sharma ( India ) said , in reviewing the world economic situation , that in the late 1980s and early 1990s globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change had seemingly held out to humanity the promise of historic change , a promise of fresh opportunities , as the developing countries increasingly participated in the growth of the world economy , to improve living standards and secure a brighter future for millions mired in poverty and underdevelopment .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
It had been assigned the task of promoting various space-related activities in Israel , including the building of an infrastructure geared towards achieving optimal economic and commercial results by making use of the countrys technological advances in selected niches , notably in the use of small satellites and remote sensing .  
Central imperative planning based on physical targets , that allowed fast initial structural change , soon came to be viewed as engendering critical rigidities and obstacles to endogenous technological and organizational change .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
This has produced a disturbing split , caused by the fact that the technological explosion is taking place in the developed countries , where a lesser portion of the world ' s population lives , while elsewhere a demographic explosion is accompanied by an acute technological deficit .  
We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
The peaceful advancement of the human family and the security of its livelihood can no longer be sustained in a world impregnated by abject poverty , external debt burden , growing technological and economic gaps between the rich and the poor , widespread hunger and malnutrition , violence and discrimination , drugs and infectious diseases .  
From the judicial perspective of The Hague , the century that is about to close is a century of great achievement and profound loss , of extraordinary scientific and technological advance and of atavistic reversion to barbarism .  
In the context of nuclear energy development , Russia considers the reduction and disposal of nuclear armaments to be connected with the peaceful use of the tremendous scientific and technological potential that used to be the exclusive domain of military programmes .  
Can we really imagine modern international political and economic relations , trade , satellites , the Internet , aviation , technological and scientific activity , cultural exchanges , environmental protection , travel , the use of natural resources , exploration of outer space and other vital human activities without a solid international legal foundation ? 
This aspect of the struggle to eradicate the scourge of anti-personnel mines deserves our attention for two major reasons : technological progress , which is the indispensable key to decisive progress in the field regarding weapons disseminated in huge numbers over vast areas , in 60 countries ; and promising scientific progress which we see today here and there .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts will certainly be of great practical importance , ensuring the speedy rescue of astronauts in case of breakdowns , accidents or forced landings , for , as scientific and technological advance continues , manned space flights will become longer and more complex every year . . . .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
The interdependence in which SMEs were supposed to live was fraught with increased complexity and risks of instability and marginalization.For many African SMEs , the opportunities created by technological advances , the increased mobility of production factors and regional trading arrangements were either still nominal or not fully accessible . 
The basic premise is to encourage bilateral and multilateral dialogue so as to promote international understanding and cooperation on the basis of the concepts identified in the preambular paragraphs of this draft : that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress and science and technology for civilian applications need to be maintained and encouraged.There are two operational components to this draft resolution . 
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
Scientific and technological breakthroughs , growing interdependence , impressive development of standards of behaviour at the international level , and the emergence of a global consensus to prevent war and curb the perils of armaments and , particularly , weapons of mass destruction are indeed significant achievements of the twentieth century .  
The guidelines also lay emphasis on a number of principles , including the principle that effective verification can be undertaken without necessarily compromising national secrets , that it is important to protect sensitive national installations and information , that care should be taken to prevent the abuse of verification , and that the economic , technological and social development of States should not be jeopardized .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .  
In its resolution 37-90 of 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly decided that , in accordance with the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , 1 the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be directed towards , among other things , stimulating the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in developing countries .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
Here is a country relatively small in size , but in terms of social , economic , financial , cultural , technological and scientific achievements , the Republic of China on Taiwan is indeed a force to be reckoned with , a formidable powerhouse .  
It should be emphasized that such cooperative activities implemented through effective programmes would contribute significantly to improving the scientific , technological and regulatory capabilities of the developing countries .  
This global agenda is not restrictive , and can be achieved through the political , cultural , educational , social , economic , information and even technological domains .  
It is inspired by a vision of the enormous potential for human development created by the end of the cold war , the accelerated pace of technological development and the deepening interdependence of nations .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
The phenomenal technological advances of the twentieth century had brought about strong industrial growth in the developed world but had left the developing countries far behind .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
There is a consensus that without democratic and topquality education it is impossible to the secure economic , social , scientific , technological , cultural or political changes to which the Panamanian State and society aspire .

That would create an excellent opportunity for promoting dialogue directed towards the formulation of a general , comprehensive set of rules for combating terrorism on the political , economic , technological and legal fronts .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
In the current environment of intensifying globalization , rapid technological advance and a knowledgeintensive economy , creative and innovative activity plays a key role in all aspects of development . 
On the technological level , new weapons research and development has continued unabated , with the emergence of more accurate nuclear ballistic missile systems and the deployment of highly accurate nuclear armed cruise missiles .  
A challenge to the established order , which may sometimes be painful , is to be expected when scientific and technological progress brings about sudden and profound changes in human societies .  
Although scientific and technological progress is being made and material wealth is being accumulated , technological symposiums and other activities reaching broad sectors of the population are needed if the desired level of development is to be attained .  
But its main task was to promote technical cooperation and implement integrated programmes , always bearing in mind the current technological revolution and the profound changes taking place in industrial organizations , especially transnational corporations .  
Liberalization is not possible in LDCs since indigenous human and technological capacities have to be developed first , supported by the gradual removal of protectionist measures and progressive application of international standards .  
It was stated that , in Argentina , at the universities in Crdoba and Neuqun , privately supported projects involving small and inexpensive satellites devoted to scientific and technological experiments were being undertaken as an effective means of promoting good education in space engineering and technology and of attracting talented young people to the subject .  
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
For ethical and practical reasons , the vicious circle of poverty and lack of access to modern technological resources must be broken , and a virtuous circle established in which such technology made it possible to achieve better standards of living .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications , including the Internet , continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world ,  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
Since it could be argued that , with better visual information , the health impact perhaps would have been less significant , a major recommendation derived from the first experiment was that , in future experiments , technological solutions had to be sought that might bring the physical environment of remote interpretation as close as possible to normal on-site conditions .  
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
In 43 countries , integrated programmes address poverty alleviation through industrial development by improving industrial governance and institutional infrastructure , strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises , upgrading technological capacities , skills and access to modern technology , export and trade capabilities , and adopting energy efficient and cleaner productive measures .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
In this context , the importance of access to scientific and technological information and databases and the threat posed by the ongoing privatization and commodification of such information on the one hand , and of stimulating local innovation without creating exclusive property rights on the other , was stressed .  
In particular , Parties have raised specific concerns regarding : ( i ) the competence of participants in the CST , ( ii ) the political nature of discussions within the CST , rather than a focus on scientific and technological issues , ( iii ) the lack of continuity of representatives to the CST , and ( iv ) inadequate time within the agenda of the CST to allow for in-depth analysis and debate of the issues .  
Emphasizing also , as documented by the United Nations Environment Programme , that ecological crises facing humanity are deeply rooted in a complex web of political , economic , social , technological as well as inadequate societal attitudes , belief systems and perceptions ,

A significant response to this challenge has emerged from various global and regional programmes of environmental research , assessments and capacity-building mainly sponsored by the international organizations that make up the scientific and technological community , including the worlds scientific academies and professional bodies and independent networks of scholars , scientists and engineers .  
Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .  
Participants in the World Conference of Scientific Academies , Tokyo , process are encouraged to examine these documents , as they provide a very valuable and detailed picture of the scientific and technological communitys views and commitments on a wide range of issues critical to sustainable development .  
The scientific and technological community is convinced that there is already a very wide range of relevant , accessible and often inexpensive technologies and processes available to meet the basic needs of the poor and socially excluded .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Over the next five years , the scientific and technological community is committed to significantly enhancing the active participation of scientists and engineers within : national sustainable development commissions ; all levels of government , as advisers to heads of State , heads of international agencies , parliaments etc . ; and private sector boards of directors .
