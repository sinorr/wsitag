Vote counting for the May 10 presidential election in the Philippines continued today with incumbent President Arroyo taking a strong lead over chief rival Poe . A watchdog body said it saw no signs of the massive cheating alleged by the opposition .  
The taciturn Megawati , widely seen as aloof and neglectful of ordinary people , has recently worked hard to reverse the perceptions during the month-long presidential campaign .  She held occasional press conferences and visited markets and other centres to mingle with the public .  
Kerry , a Vietnam veteran with shining military exploits , is able to be selected as the Democratic presidential nominee , mainly because he is recognized as the candidate with the greatest chance to challenge Bush on the issue of national security .  
On solving the relationships between the central and local authorities , and between the Kremlin and various party factions , Putin has actively consulted with all leaders , striven to reach consensus , and successively promulgated relevant policies , so that Russia 's political situation would not sink into a chaotic situation before the election .  One after another , leaders of various parties and local leaders expressed their support for Putin 's presidential race .  
On 1 January , " The New York Times " published a New Year 's Day editorial entitled " New Controversy in New Year , " coming straight to the point : Originally , January 2001 should have been a month for festivities .  However , to the Americans , such a festival atmosphere has been replaced by a sense of uncertainty or conflicts left over from the presidential election held at the end of last year .  
Gore were already in their seats on the presidential inauguration rostrum set up on the west side of Capitol Hill . They were flanked by nearly one-thousand seats reserved for dignitaries .  The entire Congress , the justices of the Supreme Court , governors from various states , and foreign leaders and diplomatic envoys attended the ceremony .  
In the light of the United States ' attitude of clinging obstinately to its course on the NMD issue and course of action in starting the research and development of advanced military satellites and space weapons , Putin recently issued another presidential order to demand an early formation of Russia 's new " celestial army " and set this 1 July as the deadline for completing the formation .  
According to our intelligence , the Chinese communists have not yet completed the plan for " the encouragement of retired officers and men of national armed forces to cross over to serve the PLA . " The Chinese communists are expected to announce and publicize the completed plan in six months at the earliest or before the presidential elections in 2004 at the latest to break down the morale of our troops .  
It was learned that the petition came about at a social gathering for senior advisers and national policy advisers held at the presidential office on Monday , when more than 20 senior advisers and advisers expressed anxiety over the proposal by Hsu Wen-pin and the others .  After some discussion , a decision was made to include more people in the petition in order to counter the proposal of acknowledging " one China as provided in the Constitution . "  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
In the LDP presidential election held in April this year , all four candidates brought forward their respective policies and ideas , and the proposed policies and ideas raised by right-wing politicians all included paying a formal homage visit to the Yasukuni Shrine and making amendments to the Constitution .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .

During the 1992 presidential election , Clinton condemned President Bush Sr . for ingratiating himself with the " Beijing butchers . "  After taking office , Clinton , as expected , was very tough with the CPC on human rights issues and threatened to link bilateral trade relations with human rights after taking office .  Only when bilateral relations worsened dramatically did Clinton begin to revise his strategy .  
The US presidential election held on 7 November was an unprecedented fierce competition .  Due to the very close numbers of votes won by Democratic presidential candidate Gore and Republican presidential candidate Bush in Florida , where the victory will be decided , the Florida authorities decided early on the morning of 8 November to recount the votes according to the local law .  Therefore , the outcome of the presidential election will be known in that evening at the earliest ( on the morning of 9 November Beijing time ) or on 9 November .  
George W . Bush , who was leading by a razor-thin majority in Florida early this morning , announced on television networks that he had won 25 electoral votes in Florida , accumulating more than 270 votes - - the threshold to be crossed for the presidency .  No sooner had he made this announcement than a vote recount was declared because of too narrow a ballot margin .  Hence a dramatic change rare in US presidential elections .  
The uncertain outcome of the 2000 US presidential election has made investors uneasy .  The New York Stock Market went down for three consecutive days beginning 8 November . The value index of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 349.23 points .  The composite index of the NASDAQ , which is mainly composed of technology stocks , was down 386.80 points and hit the lowest level of this year .  
Under the current political stalemate arising from the difficulties in deciding which presidential candidate will win , investors not only do not know where to put their money but they also worry about the prospect for the US economy .  They worry that political instability will speed up economic downturn and the continuous decline in some companies ' economic returns and will bring an economic " hard landing " instead of a " soft landing . "  
However , with Tang Yao-ming sitting above him , Chen Chen-hsiang will have no chance of taking over as chief of the General Staff for the time being .  Moreover , after this year 's presidential election , Chen once attended " Tsao Shan Night Talk , " at which he vehemently presented his views .  Therefore , Chen is faced with only minimal pressure as regards his personal advancement or retreat .  
After Federal Associate Justice Stephens was defeated in the partisan struggle in the Federal Supreme Court , he said helplessly : " Although it is impossible for us to be one hundred percent sure who will be the real winner in this year 's presidential election , but who is the failure is very clear , that is , the people have lost their confidence in the justices ' position of being just and selfless defenders of laws and are worried about the partisan struggle . "  
At a Democratic Party meeting held in Chicago on January 10 , President Clinton broke from his circumspect attitude toward the presidential race by stating , " Our candidate won the popular vote but the Republicans won the electoral vote only after they stopped the vote recount . "  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
Having seen his friend die with his own eyes , Chiang was grief stricken , but that very afternoon he still had to fly over the presidential offices and form a perfect " 60 " in the blue sky to celebrate the country 's 60th anniversary . Parting for life is hard : Pilots understand the danger of their work and have learned to accept the misfortune of others . But it is hard for loved ones that have been left behind .  
Some people have questioned whether this position , exposed on all sides , does not have unfavorable fengshui . But Chen Cheng-shen , an advisor in the office of the presidential spokes man who is well versed in the principles of geomancy , explains that as the center of national power , the Presidential Palace can repulse any evil influence which may approach along the road , while the four streets around the building express its communication with all parts of the land .  
Into the modern eraThe Directorate-General of Telecommunications ( DGT ) is located on a street corner behind the presidential offices . The DGT building has rounded corners , lines wrapping horizontally under the window sills ( rather than vertical lines which carry one 's eye up and down the building ) , rectangular windows instead of arched ones , bright coloring , and a complete absence of decorative embellishment . All these features declare that this is an edifice composed after 1920 and linked to European " modern " architecture .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media . Based on prior experience ( 120 foreign reporters for the elections two years ago and 160 foreign reporters for the elections last year ) , Chen 's office estimated that about 250 personnel would arrive from abroad to cover the presidential race .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
Brightly burning incense is looked upon by the faithful as a sacred sign . The urn glowed brightly just after Hsu Hsin-liang , the former Democratic Progressive Party chairman who is deciding whether to pursue an independent presidential candidacy , paid his respects to the icon .  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void . This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
At first merely quantitative , change has now become qualitative . Finally , in the course of a truly competitive presidential election , we broke through the idea of " Asian values " that has been manufactured out of ignorance and to serve vested interests . We shattered the assumption that Chinese people are only suited to being ruled by authoritarian regimes and can not have democracy or rule of law .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
In 1996 , the ROC 's first direct presidential election marked the first time ever that Chinese people could select their own leader on a one-man , one-vote basis . But it was also when cross-strait relations reached their nadir , as the mainland undertook missile tests prior to the election , creating extreme tension . The resulting freeze in political relations created circumstances under which any national leader of Taiwan would have to make national security the top priority .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
The resolute stance of the international community , including the rapid response of United States and allied troops and this Council 's own unequivocal presidential statement of exactly a week ago , have led to a withdrawal of the menacing Iraqi troops .  
The European Union considers that the presidential elections scheduled for 17 December should reinforce the achievements already made and should provide an example of harmony and tolerance , so that the entire population of Haiti can attain genuine national reconciliation and lay the foundations for the political , economic and social reconstruction of their country .  
By helping to sustain a secure and stable environment , UNMIH will facilitate the Government 's conduct of free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections , culminating in the peaceful transition to a newly elected Government in February 1996 .  
Annex 7 provides that the Angolan electoral process , left incomplete because of the post-electoral crisis of 1992 , must be completed through the holding of the second round of presidential elections , which are to take place once the United Nations has declared that the requisite conditions for this have been fulfilled .  
The Angolan people , in turn , demonstrated their acceptance of the objectives of that Agreement by participating enthusiastically and in an orderly manner in the legislative and presidential elections of 29 and 30 September 1992 , considered free and fair by the international community . 
In the letter of 10 February from its President addressed to the Secretary-General ( S / 1995 / 130 ) and its presidential statement of 10 February ( S / PRST / 1995 / 7 ) , the Security Council demonstrated its continued concern and , above all , its readiness to support additional practical measures and efforts that would lead to a more peaceful and stable Rwanda .  
Modification of the " first-past-the-post " system for municipal councils has yet to be addressed by the presidential commission and the political parties , but the expectation is that it will be included , together with the identity document and residential voting , in any package of reforms that may be considered by the Legislative Assembly in the coming months .  
Expresses thanks to UNMIH and the International Civilian Mission ( MICIVIH ) , and to States contributing to these Missions , for their assistance with the municipal and legislative elections held on 25 June 1995 and looks forward to their continuing efforts as Haiti prepares for the completion of these elections and for subsequent presidential elections ;

Four months after the Mission took over from the multinational force , the Secretary-General stated in his report dated 24 July 1995-3 / that UNMIH had made significant progress towards achieving the goals adopted in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) and it was expected that it would be able to maintain a secure and stable environment throughout the current election period and the forthcoming presidential elections .  
NULLWith regard to the underlying assumptions under which the revised proposal was prepared , the Committee was informed that , taking into consideration legal requirements and the need to prepare presidential elections , it was assumed that the earliest possible date for holding presidential elections would be early December 1995 .  
The offensive in western Bosnia , whose ultimate goal is the seizure of Prijedor and Banja Luka , is continuing unabated despite the demands of the Security Council contained in the presidential statement of 12 October 1995 ( S / PRST / 1995 / 52 ) , that all parties fully comply with the provisions of the cease-fire agreement and refrain from any military activity that could seriously jeopardize the peace process . 
At a time when the transitional Government was endeavouring to improve the country 's listless and unstructured economy and to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections , the international community should do all it could to mobilize support for a pluralistic and democratic Zaire .  
According to Mr . Turneb Delp , spokesman for the Front national pour le changement et la d \ x { 5e66 } ocratie , the elections could not be free and democratic since the Provisional Electoral Council was composed mostly of members who were close supporters of President Aristide or of the parties making up the presidential coalition , and the elections were marred by massive fraud .

I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
It firmly declares the will of all political forces in Bulgaria Mr . Lukanov having been an active member of Parliament for the last seven years not to permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from the path towards economic and political reform or to infringe on the peaceful and lawful process of political and public life , including the forthcoming presidential elections at the end of this month .  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
On 25 July , at around 4.30 p.m . local time in Bujumbura , my Special Representative , Mr . Marc Faguy , was informed that the armed forces had put in power a presidential candidate of their choice , deployed heavily armed units , set up roadblocks across the city and moved into the national television station .  
Although the Special Envoy received commitments from all the parties to attend talks , the new political environment resulting from developments in March-April ( presidential and legislative elections in the Sudan ; realignment of certain southern movements with the Government ) prevented their actual resumption owing to the absence of recognized , legitimate interlocutors among the parties concerned .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
However , be they federal or unitary , presidential or parliamentary , they all embody a set of essential common values , inter alia , the freedom of citizens to express themselves through free and transparent elections , and the active development and strengthening of civil society .  
The incumbent President , associated closely with the new democratic forces , lost in fair presidential elections , and again the transfer of power was smooth , orderly and dignified .  
Within our region my country took an active part in drawing up the presidential statement on a commitment to democracy , signed by the Heads of State of the members of the Southern Cone Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , together with Chile and Bolivia , which established that the full and effective functioning of democratic institutions was an essential condition for cooperation in MERCOSUR . 
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti , as reflected in particular in the holding of five elections that culminated with the presidential elections of 17 December 1995 , which permitted the first transfer of power between two democratically elected Presidents , and takes note of the partial parliamentary elections held on 6 April 1997 ;  
The Slovak party has informed representatives of the Commission of the European Union as well as the States members of the latter on all legislative , legal and internal political aspects relating to the preparation and subsequent conduct of the referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , including the fourth question on direct presidential elections which proved to be invalid from the legislative point of view .  
Less than two weeks ago , through a presidential statement , the Security Council said that civilian police in peacekeeping operations carry our indispensable functions in monitoring and training national police forces , as well as in restoring civil order , supporting the rule of law and fostering reconciliation at the national level .

Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti , as reflected in particular in the holding of five elections that culminated with the presidential elections of 17 December 1995 , which permitted the first transfer of power between two democratically elected Presidents as well as , more recently , the partial parliamentary elections held on 6 April 1997 ;  
Taking note of the presidential statement of 30 July 1997 [ 1 ] in which the Security Council , inter alia , welcomed the successful holding of presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on 19 July 1997 , noted with satisfaction the declaration in the Joint Certification Statement by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States that the electoral process had been free , fair and credible and that the outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian people ,  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
Moreover , the Revolutionary Command Council had been dissolved , a transitional National Assembly appointed and free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections held in 1996 , and a national commission set up to prepare a constitution .

The unencumbered balance of $ 2,199,100 gross ( $ 2,153,300 net ) resulted primarily from accelerated repatriation of military personnel and reduced requirements for air operations , as well as the fact that staffing and non-staff resources earmarked for the support of the run-off presidential elections were not utilized .  
The CNR agreed ( a ) that nominations to the posts of President , members of Parliament and local governmental bodies be made by political parties or individuals , ( b ) to retain the presidential system for the executive , while proposing ( c ) a professional ( full-time ) bicameral parliament .  
He recalls that the election observer mission of the OSCE concluded that the presidential elections of 15 June 1997 may have been free but were not fair , and did not meet minimum democratic standards because the State-owned media - particularly television - showed favouritism towards the ruling party .  
The internal political climate has stabilized and the country continues to move in a peaceful and orderly fashion towards the legislative and presidential elections scheduled for 28 November 1999 .  
Since my seventh report to the Council ( S / 1999 / 788 ) , events in the Central African Republic have been dominated to a large extent by the preparations for the presidential election by the Mixed and Independent Electoral Commission ( CEMI ) , which was assisted by MINURCA and various external donors , the campaign by political parties and the first round of the election , which took place on 19 September after two consecutive postponements .  
The successful completion of the democratic presidential election in Indonesia is encouraging in this context too : it is a testimony to the continued progress of democratization in Indonesia and is in itself reassuring for the future of East Timor , which needs to develop friendly and cooperative relations with neighbouring countries , Indonesia in particular .  
In fact , since 1991 , my country has been steadfastly undertaking an irreversible process of democratization that has led to several rounds of municipal , legislative and presidential elections under conditions recognized by international observers as being calm and unbiased .  
The problem of impunity was addresses in the agreements reached between the Government and the political parties and there is a formal commitment - set forth in presidential decrees - to impose administrative and judicial penalties on those found guilty of human rights violations .  
With regard to Guinea-Bissau , which is geographically outside the Mano River Union , the prevailing precarious and unstable situation in the country resulted from a lengthy crisis that occurred in three stages the overthrow of the legal Government of President Nino , the establishment of a long period of transition dominated by the military and , finally , the organization of presidential and legislative elections to install a new regime and has left its mark on the economic and social structure of the country . 
In its presidential statement on peace-building , adopted last February , the Council also reiterated that efforts to ensure lasting solutions to conflicts and to maintain the momentum for peace in any given country or region require increased solidarity , sustained political will and timely and adequate resources on the part of the international community .  
Your endorsement hopefully through a presidential statement of the need for the United Nations to remain fully committed through a predictable and dependable source of funding for the post-independence requirements of East Timor which perhaps more than any other country will be the child of the United Nations and of this Council will send a powerful , reassuring message to the people and to the Second Transitional Government , which has a huge challenge before it in the months ahead , as well as to the Constituent Assembly of East Timor .  
The Ivorian patriots were just savouring that victory , so dearly yet so proudly won over the military regime , whose rule had been marked by numerous barbaric acts committed against civilian populations , when , to their great surprise , there rang out over foreign radio stations appeals by the Rassemblement des Rpublicains ( RDR ) , calling upon its militants to oppose the victory of candidate Laurent Gbagbo and thereby calling into question the presidential election of 22 October 2000 .

On 1 January , " The New York Times " published a New Year 's Day editorial entitled " New Controversy in New Year , " coming straight to the point : Originally , January 2001 should have been a month for festivities .  However , to the Americans , such a festival atmosphere has been replaced by a sense of uncertainty or conflicts left over from the presidential election held at the end of last year .  
Gore were already in their seats on the presidential inauguration rostrum set up on the west side of Capitol Hill . They were flanked by nearly one-thousand seats reserved for dignitaries .

It was learned that the petition came about at a social gathering for senior advisers and national policy advisers held at the presidential office on Monday , when more than 20 senior advisers and advisers expressed anxiety over the proposal by Hsu Wen-pin and the others .  After some discussion , a decision was made to include more people in the petition in order to counter the proposal of acknowledging " one China as provided in the Constitution . "  
Officials of the senior presidential office and the Executive Yuan admitted frankly that direct shipping between the two sides of the strait constitutes the most difficult part in the current plan to comprehensively open up cross-strait economic and trade exchanges , but the initial plan will still designate six domestic ports as the cargo handling ports for cross-strait shipping .  
In the LDP presidential election held in April this year , all four candidates brought forward their respective policies and ideas , and the proposed policies and ideas raised by right-wing politicians all included paying a formal homage visit to the Yasukuni Shrine and making amendments to the Constitution .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
Reportedly , after drawing from the experience of the military pressure exerted during Taiwan 's presidential elections in 1996 and also for the sake of avoiding unnecessary conjecture , the air force , navy , and missile troops along the southeast coastal areas have received orders to suspend all their military exercises one week before and after Taiwan 's current presidential elections .  The military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .

Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .

During the 1992 presidential election , Clinton condemned President Bush Sr . for ingratiating himself with the " Beijing butchers . "  After taking office , Clinton , as expected , was very tough with the CPC on human rights issues and threatened to link bilateral trade relations with human rights after taking office .  Only when bilateral relations worsened dramatically did Clinton begin to revise his strategy .  
The US presidential election held on 7 November was an unprecedented fierce competition .  Due to the very close numbers of votes won by Democratic presidential candidate Gore and Republican presidential candidate Bush in Florida , where the victory will be decided , the Florida authorities decided early on the morning of 8 November to recount the votes according to the local law .  Therefore , the outcome of the presidential election will be known in that evening at the earliest ( on the morning of 9 November Beijing time ) or on 9 November .  
George W . Bush , who was leading by a razor-thin majority in Florida early this morning , announced on television networks that he had won 25 electoral votes in Florida , accumulating more than 270 votes - - the threshold to be crossed for the presidency .  No sooner had he made this announcement than a vote recount was declared because of too narrow a ballot margin .  Hence a dramatic change rare in US presidential elections .  
The uncertain outcome of the 2000 US presidential election has made investors uneasy .  The New York Stock Market went down for three consecutive days beginning 8 November . The value index of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 349.23 points .  The composite index of the NASDAQ , which is mainly composed of technology stocks , was down 386.80 points and hit the lowest level of this year .  
Under the current political stalemate arising from the difficulties in deciding which presidential candidate will win , investors not only do not know where to put their money but they also worry about the prospect for the US economy .  They worry that political instability will speed up economic downturn and the continuous decline in some companies ' economic returns and will bring an economic " hard landing " instead of a " soft landing . "  
However , with Tang Yao-ming sitting above him , Chen Chen-hsiang will have no chance of taking over as chief of the General Staff for the time being .  Moreover , after this year 's presidential election , Chen once attended " Tsao Shan Night Talk , " at which he vehemently presented his views .  Therefore , Chen is faced with only minimal pressure as regards his personal advancement or retreat .  
After Federal Associate Justice Stephens was defeated in the partisan struggle in the Federal Supreme Court , he said helplessly : " Although it is impossible for us to be one hundred percent sure who will be the real winner in this year 's presidential election , but who is the failure is very clear , that is , the people have lost their confidence in the justices ' position of being just and selfless defenders of laws and are worried about the partisan struggle . "  
At a Democratic Party meeting held in Chicago on January 10 , President Clinton broke from his circumspect attitude toward the presidential race by stating , " Our candidate won the popular vote but the Republicans won the electoral vote only after they stopped the vote recount . "  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
Having seen his friend die with his own eyes , Chiang was grief stricken , but that very afternoon he still had to fly over the presidential offices and form a perfect " 60 " in the blue sky to celebrate the country 's 60th anniversary . Parting for life is hard : Pilots understand the danger of their work and have learned to accept the misfortune of others . But it is hard for loved ones that have been left behind .  
Some people have questioned whether this position , exposed on all sides , does not have unfavorable fengshui . But Chen Cheng-shen , an advisor in the office of the presidential spokes man who is well versed in the principles of geomancy , explains that as the center of national power , the Presidential Palace can repulse any evil influence which may approach along the road , while the four streets around the building express its communication with all parts of the land .  
Into the modern eraThe Directorate-General of Telecommunications ( DGT ) is located on a street corner behind the presidential offices . The DGT building has rounded corners , lines wrapping horizontally under the window sills ( rather than vertical lines which carry one 's eye up and down the building ) , rectangular windows instead of arched ones , bright coloring , and a complete absence of decorative embellishment . All these features declare that this is an edifice composed after 1920 and linked to European " modern " architecture .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media . Based on prior experience ( 120 foreign reporters for the elections two years ago and 160 foreign reporters for the elections last year ) , Chen 's office estimated that about 250 personnel would arrive from abroad to cover the presidential race .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
Fifty years of a common destiny forged in fortune and misfortune have united us all into a closely bound and interdependent community . The first-ever popular presidential election has reconfirmed our collective consciousness that we in Taiwan have to work together as one . How to make this land of ours more beautiful and how to make its inhabitants feel safer and live a happier and more harmonious life is the common responsibility of our 21.3 million people !  
The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides . Skeptics argued that the proposal was aimed at expanding presidential power and establishing a firm foundation for the vice-president serving concurrently as premier . Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
Brightly burning incense is looked upon by the faithful as a sacred sign . The urn glowed brightly just after Hsu Hsin-liang , the former Democratic Progressive Party chairman who is deciding whether to pursue an independent presidential candidacy , paid his respects to the icon .  
" During this final transitional year , " comments an editorial in the China Times , " Lee Teng-hui must do three things : construct a new parliamentary system , complete the nomination of the Kuomintang 's presidential candidate and assist in the election , and achieve a transition in political power that maintains a stable social structure . "  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void . This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
As the first Taiwanese president , Lee Teng-hui 's success did a lot to assuage the anger of the Taiwanese people about the discrimination they had experienced . This won him a lot of support . On top of that , once in power he implemented a policy of shifting the island 's cultural center of gravity away from mainland China and more toward Taiwan itself , and he criticized the KMT as being " a regime of outsiders . " These positions won him 54% of the vote in the first direct presidential election .  
During the months leading up to the presidential election in March , non-cable TV stations China Television Company ( CTV ) , Taiwan Television ( TTV ) , and China Television System ( CTS ) were roundly criticized for biased and unbalanced reporting . There were reports that a senior executive at one of these stations actually issued an order to go all out in support of the ruling party . He reportedly said , " For the next three months , we do n't want you paying any attention to the ratings . "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
At first merely quantitative , change has now become qualitative . Finally , in the course of a truly competitive presidential election , we broke through the idea of " Asian values " that has been manufactured out of ignorance and to serve vested interests . We shattered the assumption that Chinese people are only suited to being ruled by authoritarian regimes and can not have democracy or rule of law .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
In 1996 , the ROC 's first direct presidential election marked the first time ever that Chinese people could select their own leader on a one-man , one-vote basis . But it was also when cross-strait relations reached their nadir , as the mainland undertook missile tests prior to the election , creating extreme tension . The resulting freeze in political relations created circumstances under which any national leader of Taiwan would have to make national security the top priority .  
New legislators will be sworn in on February 1 , 2002 . Until then the political situation will remain murky . In recent days Executive Yuan secretary-general Chiou I-jen has again proposed revising the Constitution to create a presidential system , or to create a genuine " dual executive " system ( the system used in France ) , in order to once and for all resolve constitutional power struggles between the executive and legislative bodies .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
In particular , the 23 November demonstration on the streets of Taipei by 120,000 farmers and fishermen drew the attention of the whole nation . It stole much of the thunder from the first round of live TV debates between the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates , which had taken place shortly beforehand . The lack of coordination between the presidential office and the cabinet , the voices of dissent against the central government from within the ruling DPP and the continuing political fallout from the cabinet reshuffle will inevitably impact the Taipei and Kaohsiung elections .  
However , external criticism focused on how the Ministry of Finance turned the eighth seat over to representation by the Executive Yuan Development Fund . If the shares held by the Executive Yuan Development Fund are sold off under the announced privatization policy , the government will lose its board majority . If there is a change of government after the presidential elections next year , the huge operational power of Mega Holdings will revert to private shareholders and chairman Cheng Shen-chi 's position will become unassailable .  
It was a serious blow to anti-nuclear activists when the Legislative Yuan approved funding for construction of the 4NPP seven years ago . These activists and the DPP responded by becoming determined to totally revolutionize energy policy and public opinion . In the 2000 presidential election , the DPP won the office of the presidency , and to fulfill its campaign promises , conducted a reevaluation of the 4NPP and subsequently announced the suspension of its construction . This move , however , provoked a major constitutional crisis , pitting the president against the opposition-controlled legislature .  
( Laura Li / tr . by Anthony W . Sariti ) The recent referendum held in Pinglin Township favoring the opening of a Pinglin exit on the Taipei-Ilan Freeway led to the resignation of Environmental Protection Administrator Hao Lung-bin and focused public opinion on the issue of advisory referendums . The possibility that during the March presidential election next year referendums will be simultaneously held on entry into the World Health Organization , the fourth nuclear power station , and the reform of the National Assembly is also drawing close attention from observers .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
The resolute stance of the international community , including the rapid response of United States and allied troops and this Council 's own unequivocal presidential statement of exactly a week ago , have led to a withdrawal of the menacing Iraqi troops .  
The European Union considers that the presidential elections scheduled for 17 December should reinforce the achievements already made and should provide an example of harmony and tolerance , so that the entire population of Haiti can attain genuine national reconciliation and lay the foundations for the political , economic and social reconstruction of their country .  
By helping to sustain a secure and stable environment , UNMIH will facilitate the Government 's conduct of free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections , culminating in the peaceful transition to a newly elected Government in February 1996 .
