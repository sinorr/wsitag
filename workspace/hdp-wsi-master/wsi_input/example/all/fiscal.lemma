To practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing the revenues of collected administrative service fees , fines , and forfeitures is an important job to improve fiscal management and rectify fiscal and economic order .  It is also an important measure to prevent and correct corruption at the revenue source , keep government functionaries honest and industrious , ensure impartial law-enforcement , and manage government affairs in accordance with the law .  
The main responsible official and directly responsible official of a unit which has used fiscal funds , raised money , or imposed levies for the building or expansion of any commemorative facility in violation of the rules shall be dealt with sternly in accordance with the relevant provisions of party and government discipline .  
For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .  
So acting in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee and the Central Economic Work Conference , stressing the central link of state-owned enterprise [ SOE ] reform , and continuing to promote all reforms such as fiscal , financial , circulation , S &amp; T , education , housing , social security , and income distribution , will be crucial to clearing the system obstacles to promoting demand and improving supply , to establish the necessary system climate .  
Having coolly analyzed the economic situation at the time , carried out thorough investigation and study , and extensively listened to the suggestions and views of experts and scholars , the central authorities held a timely meeting , looked into and set out a policy of further strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , and readjusted the intensity and specific measures of the fiscal policy .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
For the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .  Despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .  
Judging from the actual needs of the current national economic growth , Xiang Huaicheng said , the proactive fiscal policy still requires the necessary policy efforts in order to achieve the goals of ultimately expanding internal demand and promoting steady economic growth and to provide guarantee for quality and efficient development in national economic restructuring and scientific and technological advancement .  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .  The state 's efforts to stimulate domestic demand , and gradually put the proactive fiscal policy into place , have produced a certain effect of stimulating the market for Liaoning industries .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
For the state to set aside some fiscal revenue to ensure the basic living needs and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise workers is not only the demand of implementing the party 's program of wholehearted service for the people , but is also the requirement of creating and stable social environment for the continued development of reform and construction .  
Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
Through continuing to deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , we should establish a complete and unified fiscal and taxation system , and expand the sources of government revenue ; we must also strengthen fiscal and tax management and ensure that all collectable revenue is collected , put a stop to artificial revenue loss , rationally arrange fiscal funds , pay attention to returns in the use of funds , oppose extravagance and waste , and promote thrift and economy .  
In order to increase domestic demand and stimulate economic growth , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council pursued a proactive fiscal policy for three consecutive years , thus creating a fine macroeconomic environment for the process of reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
In recent years , the Central Committee has addressed the problems of overproduction and constant lowering of prices in China . In order to curb the trend of deflation , the Central Committee authoritatively made major policy decisions that included increasing domestic demand , the implementing positive fiscal policy , and stable and healthy currency policy studies .  They decided to issue more national bonds and increase infrastructure construction .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The continual loss of resources of state authority and economic and fiscal resources supporting such authority resources makes the government 's command implementation mechanisms exist in name only , rendering the state totally incapable of fighting big entrenched benefit-distribution groups in society and criminal groups in society .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
The continuous growth of the tax revenue has contributed significantly to the increased financial strength of various levels of government , effective implementation of the proactive fiscal policy , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .

When talking about the central government 's 2000 final accounting report approved by the Standing Committee , Li Peng said : It is necessary to more effectively implement the law on budgets and the decision on intensifying the central government 's budget auditing supervision and other relevant laws , guarantee that the budget of the current fiscal year approved by the NPC session will be implemented properly , prevent the appearance of law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena in the course of implementing the budget .  
During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
financial fraud and violations of fiscal and economic discipline are widespread ; there is fraud and deception in tendering for construction projects , and the quality of some projects is inferior ; the cultural markets are chaotic ; and major and serious safety accidents occur from time to time in production operations .  Some new characteristics have recently emerged in illegal activities , such as crimes being committed by syndicates , transregional crimes , crimes committed by collusion between outside and inside , specialized crime , and intellectualized crime .  
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng pointed out at today 's fiscal work forum that China will continue to conscientiously implement a proactive fiscal policy , consolidate and standardize the economic order , promote the sustained , healthy and rapid development of the national economy , ensure a steady improvement in the people 's livelihood , maintain social stability , and promote economic restructuring in its fiscal work in the second half of the year .  
We must accord full importance to the functions and role of public finance , implement a correct fiscal policy , and readjust and optimize the composition of outlays in a timely way in order to better serve the development of advanced productive forces and the promotion of the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
Third , efforts must be made to maintain the country 's long-term peace and stability by taking further steps to ensure fiscal outlays for public security organs , procuratorial organs , people 's courts , judicial departments and other law-enforcement organs , giving positive assistance to the departments concerned in strengthening the comprehensive improvement of public order , energetically consolidating economic order in the marketplace and strictly cracking down on major crimes .  
China 's healthy and steady economic growth over many years is an expression of the state 's unswerving implementation of correct economic policies , including the active fiscal policy , reform of state enterprises , reform of the financial setup , reform of grain circulation , reform of the social security system , and economic restructuring , which is listed as the focal point in work this year .  
According to the latest statistics released by the People 's Bank of China , the country 's moderate fiscal policy has yielded desired results , and the country 's stable and healthy financial conditions during the first half of this year have proved to be strong support for both its economic restructuring and its sustained national economic growth .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
At the National Audit Working Forum held here today , Li Jinhua , auditor-general of the National Audit Office , said that since the " Audit Law " was promulgated six years ago , budget execution audit has played a positive role in safeguarding the financial and economic order , driving the reform of the fiscal system , reinforcing budget management , promoting administration by law , and strengthening the building of clean and honest administration .  
At meetings in Beidaihe , the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically discussed problems China would face after joining the WTO . The Political Bureau has decided to set up a WTO-accession financial and fiscal work leading group .  Led by Wen Jiabao , vice premier of the State Council , the leading group will call a national financial and fiscal work meeting in November . The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
It was learned that the leading group led by Wen Jiabao is drafting a report on China 's financial and fiscal structure after the WTO accession .  The report will give a comprehensive assessment of China 's financial and fiscal situations in terms of legal system , organization , operation , and personnel , and propose countermeasures for a series of problems China will face after its entry to the WTO , such as capital drain , unhealthy competition in the credit market , and risks arising from international speculative activities in the stock market .  
Discussing the proactive fiscal policy in depth is conducive to helping us unify our thought and formulate and implement the active fiscal policy more rationally and with a more scientific approach .  It is even more conducive to promoting the smooth implementation of the macro-economic policy and the sustained and healthy development of our economy .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
After 20 years of economic reform and development , a mechanism of steady growth in fiscal revenue compatible with socialist market economy has been basically established .  It has demonstrated tremendous vitality .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The implementation of the proactive fiscal policy has protected social stability , maintained the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy , and improved the people 's living standards although it has also increased deficits and debts .  
According to experts , China has an ample supply of resources and a surplus of productive capacity .  A buyers ' market is taking shape and there is substantial material guarantee .  An increase in fiscal deficits and government debts can arouse the hidden production factors and stimulate economic growth .  
The theme of the fiscal budget is " scaling new heights , " which is exactly an ardent aspiration shared by some 7 million Hong Kong residents .  After enduring the financial storm over the past two years , quite a few residents have sustained such blows as salary cuts or lay-offs .  However , they have carried forward the spirit of working hard despite hardships and accepted the challenge from a new century marked by knowledge economy .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
The national defense budget for this fiscal year will be raised by 12.7 percent ; the task of cutting 500,000 military personnel set three years ago has been completed ;  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
At the end of 1998 , Japan began implementing the proactive fiscal policy and the unbalanced budget , slashed income taxes and taxes for legal persons , and increased public investment by issuing a large amount of treasury bonds , in an effort to promote the economic recovery .

At the end of 1998 , Japan began implementing the proactive fiscal policy and the unbalanced budget , slashed income taxes and taxes for legal persons , and increased public investment by issuing a large amount of treasury bonds , in an effort to promote the economic recovery .  
US President Clinton recently submitted to Congress the national defense budget for fiscal 2001 ; the total amount of the budget is $ 305.4 billion , an increase of $ 16.5 billion - - 5.7 percent - - over that of fiscal 2000 ; the figure represents over one-third of total global military expenditure and is equivalent to the total expenditure of the eight countries ( regions ) which rank after the United States .  
The total amount for the county as a whole reached over 20 million yuan a year ; but , to make up for their respective fiscal shortfalls , the townships basically diverted all of the money .  As peasants were not able to benefit from contributing to the public accumulation fund , they naturally became unwilling to pay this " for nothing " money which , seeming clear , was a confused matter .  
In Fuyang City where township finance is mainly dependent on taxes and fees levied on peasants , the tax and fee reform reduced the county 's fiscal supply capability by a half .  Under the fiscal pressure , the townships had no way out , but could only resort to cutting personnel , operations , spending , and bureaucracy and have worked to establish rigid mechanisms constraining the size of government .  
Originally , it was believed that the Senate would pass the bill without problem .  However , all of a sudden , halfway , out rushed a " Cheng Yaojin [ a character in a Chinese story ] , " who claimed that the Senate would not act as " rubber stamp " and demanded that some bills with strong colors of the US bipartisan political struggle , such as the bill on fiscal appropriations , and so on , be deliberated and examined together with the bill on granting the PNTR status to China .  
Part of that , 191.053 billion yuan , was used to repay the principal and interest of internal and external debts ; 179.16 billion yuan was spent reducing the deficit for the year ; and the remaining 1.29 billion yuan was used to replenish the central fiscal sinking fund .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : The fiscal revenue at the central level in 1999 increased by 95.721 billion yuan over the previous year , accounting for 61 percent of the increment in the total national fiscal revenue .  It not only enabled the proportion of the national fiscal revenue in the GDP to continue on a rising curve , from 12.4 percent in 1998 to 13.9 percent in 1999 , but also increased the proportion of the central fiscal revenue in the national fiscal revenue from 49.5 percent in 1998 to 51.1 percent in 1999 .  
Regarding the arrangement for , and use of , the central fiscal expenditure , Xiang Huaicheng said : In the area of central fiscal expenditure , we have conscientiously implemented the strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision of the second session of the Ninth NPC .  It has played a positive role in such areas as promoting the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy ; helping state enterprises intensify their reforms ;  
and improving the people 's living standard and safeguarding social stability .  With a conscientious and responsible attitude , we have implemented well the positive fiscal policies and worked hard to give play to the role of the treasury in macroregulation and control ;  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Auditing Administration conducted the audit and did a tremendous amount work on the execution of the 1999 central budget and other fiscal income and expenditure as well as the management and utilization of the 1998 state bonds special funds , thereby playing an active supervisory role in safeguarding the state financial and economic order .  
Economic experts here said that the good trend of national economic operation and the smooth progress in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises are the result of the implementation of both the CPC Central Committee and State Council measure to expand domestic demand and the pro-active fiscal policy .  Measures to crack down hard on smuggling and to encourage exports have provided a favorable external environment and market space for the turnaround of state enterprises .  
Since the proactive fiscal policy was put into practice in the second half of 1998 , the Chinese Government has cumulatively issued around 270 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds and the funds raised through the bonds have mainly been used for infrastructure construction , technological transformation , environmental protection and ecological projects , and the construction of educational and cultural facilities .  
To avoid the possible economic downturn and to maintain sustained rapid healthy national economic development , the central authorities have resolutely made major policy decisions to expand domestic demand and implement the proactive fiscal policy .  
In light of the new situation of economic operations in 1999 , the central authorities continued to implement the proactive fiscal policy and , on the basis of the planned long-term treasury bond issue worth 50 billion yuan , further issued 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds . 
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
To maintain the good momentum in economic development in the current situation , we should step up our efforts to implement the proactive fiscal policy and do all we can to better achieve the planned targets for this year so that a solid foundation will be laid for economic development and social stability .  
The reporters have learned from the national fiscal work conference being held here that an important turn for the better appeared in China 's economy during the first half of the year , and the proactive fiscal policy practiced by the Chinese government played a dominant role in the improvement .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : Through reforms , the government will further improve the existing taxation system .  It will establish a tax collection and management system that is solid in basic management , advanced in the means of collection and management , and separated in collection , management , and inspection .  This system , which will integrate law enforcement with service , will close tax loopholes and promote the steady increase of fiscal revenues .  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
Recently , individuals in economic circles have pointed out that the major turnaround we are seeing in macroeconomic operations shows that the various macroeconomic regulatory measures - - primarily the aggressive fiscal policies - - implemented by China are having a significant positive effect , creating a golden historical opportunity for China 's economic development .  
In keeping with the operational state of the national economy , China 's financial expenditures and outlays maintained fairly rapid growth during the first half of the year , with fiscal revenues coming to 624 billion yuan , an increase of 94.6 billion yuan ( or 17.9% ) over the same period last year , while nationwide fiscal outlays came to 583.8 billion yuan , an increase of 119.0 billion yuan ( or 25.6% ) over the same period the previous year . 
ensure the sustained rapid and stable growth of fiscal revenue ; redress the local and departmental policies of levying taxes first before returning them to the central government ;  
Through system renovations and supporting reforms , fully mobilize the enthusiasm for creativeness on the part of personnel of various categories , advance the development of outstanding personnel , and enhance public institutions ' vigor and capacity for self-development , thereby reducing the state 's fiscal burdens and enhancing the development of high-quality , socialized professional and technical personnel .  
Organization and personnel departments at all levels should fully perform their functions of providing macro-level regulation and operational guidance , successfully carry out the work of initiating and coordinating efforts , act in close coordination with personnel planning , fiscal , labor , and social security agencies as well as sectoral agencies in charge of science , education , culture , health , information , and publishing , so as to form a joint force and carry out concerted efforts to successfully complete this work .  
In short , the work of institutional reform is proceeding in an orderly manner in various areas .  The focus of the next step of reform is to vigorously proceed with the institutional reform of the cities , counties , and townships , changing functions , optimizing personnel structures , reducing fiscal and peasant burdens , and improving work efficiency and service quality .  It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and study and to get well prepared for work in all areas .  
Chen Guangyi said : While constantly deepening reform and accelerating restructuring , we should now continue to implement the proactive fiscal policy and maintain the necessary efforts .  The State Council has proposed that 50 billion yuan of additional long-term treasure bonds for raising construction funds be issued by the Ministry of Finance through commercial banks in the second half of this year , and the central budget be readjusted accordingly .  The proposed measures are necessary .  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
The secret national defense budget for next fiscal year will total more than 58 billion yuan .  To strengthen their combat readiness in the electronic and communications arenas , the plans proposed by the armed forces include completion of an electronic counterattack shelter network and an online defense system .  Geared against Chicom 's active efforts to develop electromagnetic impulse attack , there will also be a " project to protect against electromagnetic impulse . "  
With regard to measures against missiles , although the TMD system being developed is a thing in the far distant future , in the next fiscal year the national armed forces will still invest more than 6 billion yuan to build up joint air defense and counterattack capabilities .  
On the one hand , the state will continue to pursue an expansive fiscal policy and issue additional treasury bonds ; the technical-transformation projects supported by the state will be carried out step by step .  In addition , investment in the western region will increase , enterprises will recover their confidence in investment , and an internal driving force for promoting the growth of investment will be gradually strengthened .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
The Chinese government made flexible use of fiscal policies in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation to promote the sustainable , rapid and sound development of the national economy during the Ninth FYP period , thus making an important contribution to the enrichment of experience in macro-control .  
Second , in light of changes in the situation after China 's entry into the World Trade Organization , it will continue to deepen the reform of the fiscal revenue system , further improve the revenue-sharing system between the central and local governments , positively promote the reform of the fiscal budget system , improve the system of the transfer of payments by the Treasury , actively and steadily promote the transformation of administrative fees into taxes , and gradually establish a public financial framework that meets the needs of the socialist market economy .  
According to Wang Jun , the Ministry of Finance has adjusted its internal mechanism and functions to meet the requirements of the establishment of the new fiscal expenditure management system this year after fully taking into consideration the needs of major financial reforms such as the unified control of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds and the establishment of a centralized system of receipt and payment by the Treasury .  
The state will very soon publish the favored treatment measures for supporting the great development of west China , including intensifying the shift of fiscal expenditure and construction funds , speeding up the pace of reforms and opening up in the western regions , and encouraging foreign businesses and other regions of China to invest in the west , and so on .  
In order to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development during the 10th Five-year Plan , we should continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a steady monetary policy , so as to spur investment and consumption and encourage exports .  
He expressed his concern for the sustainability of China 's medium-term fiscal policies , considering in particular the contingent liability of the financial sector as well as possible expenditures for the social security net , pension funds , infrastructure construction and environmental protection in future .  
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng stressed at the closing ceremony : As our country 's fiscal work will be faced with great opportunities and challenges in the new century , we must adapt to changes in the environment both at home and abroad , firmly grasp the initiative in fiscal work , and concentrate efforts on structuring a framework of public finance suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy and on building stable , balanced , and strong state finances to better serve the overall interests of economic and social development .  
Xiang Huaicheng demanded : With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , comrades engaged in fiscal work must conscientiously change their mentality by changing their thinking from that of the planned finance in the past to that of public finance . 
In addition , we must strengthen the development of the contingent of cadres and try hard to build a contingent of fiscal and financial cadres who are smart and capable , highly efficient , honest , and pragmatic .  
On the basis of making a thorough analysis of the situation and assuming overall responsibility , the party and government judged the hour and sized up the situation , pooled the masses ' wisdom , and put forward a series of major measures for enlivening the economy and stimulating demand : Putting into effect an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy ;  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
If the fund is used in advance , the authorities will have no money to use once an incident occurs.Last year , the old authorities agreed to release a special fund in NT $ 14.3 billion before the new fiscal year began to help resolve financial problems faced by counties and cities .  
During the election days , he proposed that a total of $ 1,300 billion should be cut in taxes within the coming nine years starting fiscal year 2002 .  This will include lowering all income tax rates , doubling the tax relief for child-raising , providing tax cuts for married couples , abolishing the federal inheritance tax , and increasing tax reductions on charity donations .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In 1998 , the CPC Central Committee decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to overcome the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis , expand domestic demand , and maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy national development .  
Facts have proved that implementation of a proactive fiscal policy and issuance of government bonds for long-term development to increase investment is a correct policy decision adopted by the party Central Committee . It represents a successful practice of ours in resolving problems that we encounter on the way forward through continued development and in adjusting our macroeconomic control policies in a timely manner in light of changes at home and abroad .  
The overall living standard has witnessed a historic change from simply having enough food and clothing to leading a relatively comfortable life .  Compared with 1995 , Xinjiang 's fiscal revenue nearly doubled to 13.55 billion yuan , with annual growth of 14.5 percent .  
Accordingly , in addition to continuing to implement aggressive fiscal policies , we must make a major effort to intensify structural reforms , stimulating the intrinsic driving forces behind economic development , developing new sources of motive power for economic growth , gradually reducing the degree to which economic growth relies on aggressive fiscal policies , and creating a mechanism for sustained , stable development .  
Thanks to the efforts to continuously carry out the pro-active fiscal policy , major expenditures were basically guaranteed and a bigger stride was taken toward the reform of the budget system .  The guiding ideologies , principles , and focus of the 2001 plan for national economic and social development and the 2001 budget arrangements are correct and reflect the spirit of the 15th National Party Congress and the fifth plenary session of the 15th CPC Central Committee . The general arrangements are basically feasible .  
When inspecting Fort Stewart military base as commander-in-chief of armed forces for the first time on Monday this week , Bush announced that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year would be increased by another $ 14 billion , bringing the total US military budget to $ 31 billion .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
The year 2000 was the third year in which the country implemented an active fiscal policy .  As result of the investment projects , financed with the capital obtained from floating national bonds , the economic growth increased 1.7 percent .  That was another significant contribution the active financial policy made for the national economic growth following the additional economic growths of 1.5 and 2 percent 1998 and 1999 , respectively .  
Facts have proved : The Chinese Government is right in adopting the active fiscal policy ; that the results obtained from this active fiscal policy of floating more national bonds and invest the money in building more infrastructure projects are remarkable ; and that building more key projects and pooling the resources on building some large projects that China wanted to build but was unable to build can help economic restructuring , improve the quality of economic growth , and improve enterprises ' economic performance .  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Financial and Economic Committee maintained that the 2001 central and local budgets have been arranged continuously according to the requirements set forth in the proactive fiscal policy .  In arranging expenditures , attention has been paid to increasing expenditures on agriculture , education , and science and technology ;  
In accordance with the requirement of developing the socialist market economy and the principle of making financial authority correspond to administrative authority , it is necessary to rationally divide the financial authority and administrative authority of governments at all levels , enhance their functions of financial redistribution , improve the method of using central revenue to subsidize local expenditures , and gradually establish a standardized system of fiscal transfers of payments and improve the fiscal system .  
We should adhere to the policy of expanding domestic demand and continue to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy so as to promote the steady growth of effective demand and the adjustment of economic structure .  We should strengthen the foundation position of agriculture , increase peasants ' income , and consolidate and expand results in helping state-owned enterprises carry out reform and eliminate deficits .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
With reserves of that size , he said , Hong Kong had a government with no debt ; accumulated fiscal reserves around US $ 48 billion ; a simple tax system and corporate and personal taxes at a level amongst the lowest in the world . 
" The success of this two-pronged approach is evidenced by the fact that we have not only raised sufficient revenue to meet our spending needs but we have also built up a very healthy level of fiscal reserves . 
On fiscal policy , Mr Kwong said : " Our sound financial position depends largely on our strict discipline in controlling expenditure and our efforts in maintaining a stable and productive revenue base .  
These are a high savings rate , a dedicated and flexible labour force with good education and professional training , a well - established and properly supervised banking sector , advanced infrastructure for the financial markets , fiscal and monetary prudence , a government supporting the private sector but not imposing government leadership on economic development , and last but not the least , the rule of law . 
The guarantees of a high degree of autonomy contained in the Basic Law , free-market policies , prudent fiscal management , the rule of law , a level playing field , a highly-efficient civil service , and vigorous anti-corruption action were also major factors in Hong Kong 's continued success .  
My Administration will work to preserve Hong Kong 's special characteristics - the rule of law ; open and accountable government ; prudent fiscal policies ; low and predictable taxes ; personal , social and economic freedoms , and a civil service that is efficient and honest .  
The IMF Mission noted that the existing policy framework , including the linked exchange rate system , prudent fiscal policy , careful supervision of the financial sector and non-interventionist approach in factor markets , has proved to be effective and resilient in withstanding external pressures on the Hong Kong market .  
In our view , the existing policy framework - which includes the linked exchange rate system , a prudent fiscal policy , the careful supervision of the financial sector , and a non-interventionist approach to factor markets - has been extremely successful in fostering strong and sustainable growth in the past . 
As these receipts are expected to moderate , the surplus would narrow automatically in the coming fiscal year , but remain at a comfortable level .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
" Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
" One of the reasons that we are able to look beyond the hard times to a bright future for Hong Kong is that we have the powerful backing of our nation .  In addition , we have ample fiscal reserves , sound banking systems , as well as the resilience and wisdom of the people of Hong Kong , which will be brought into fuller play under the principle of ' Hong Kong people running Hong Kong ' . "  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - - if not the first - - to rebound .  
" We possess strong economic fundamentals , with a high saving rate , large fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves and a remarkable productivity capacity .  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - if not the first - to rebound . 
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
During the recent financial turmoil in Asia , the Government of the HKSAR , with its stable public finances and healthy fiscal reserves , has formulated on its own appropriate measures to deal with the problem and has successfully maintained the stability of the linked exchange rate .  Hong Kong continues to prosper and maintain its status as a leading international shipping , trade , financial and business centre .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .  Year after year , since the linked exchange rate was established , our fiscal reserves every year average about 2% of GDP . And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's solid economic foundation , strong fiscal reserves as well as sound banking and financial practices are the principal factors that will help Hong Kong recover sooner than most of its neighbours .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
" We have in place a business friendly environment , a prudent fiscal policy , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services .  
We have a free and open economy ; excellent regulatory systems ; huge fiscal and foreign reserves ; tried , tested and successful fiscal policies ; level playing field for all who do business here ; a vigorous anti-corruption commission ; a versatile and flexible workforce ; and world class infrastructure and communication .  
Banks ' finances are generally healthy and well cushioned , the Government holds substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves and is not burdened by any public debt , the corporate sector is slimming and rationalising its operations for greater efficiency and competitiveness , the labour force is adapting promptly to more stringent employment conditions , inflation is moderating , and the economy as a whole is displaying the profound flexibility that is indeed required for it to weather the present difficulties . 
This is underpinned in particular by sustained high economic growth and further reform and opening up in the Mainland will provide ample opportunities for Hong Kong . Additionally , our past prudent financial management has produced very strong fiscal reserve which will provide a solid base for a strong recovery in a not too distant future . "  
" To maintain our US / HK dollar link , we have an effective currency board system backed by the third largest foreign reserves in the world , a high savings rate , a strong fiscal position with no government foreign debt , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent , flexible , labour force and first-class infrastructure . "  
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
But I can say for sure that our financial foundation is very solid , our monetary system is robust , our currency , backed up by the currency board arrangement , is stable .  Our policies to stick to the linked exchange rate system and prudent fiscal management will remain unchanged .  
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
" We represent the model of sound economic management in the region : a truly free market operating under the rule of law ; a well-regulated financial sector ; and a clean government that has exercised great prudence in fiscal management , " he said .  
Our primary aim is to maintain sound and stable public finances and foster a fiscal environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
In this context , we attach particular importance to developing and releasing data on the external current and capital accounts , and to publishing more timely and detailed data on fiscal developments ( including the consolidated funds ) .

" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
The IMF also commended the Government 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Government 's room for manoeuvre in the current economic downturn .  
Directors commended the Hong Kong SARG 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Hong Kong SARG 's room for maneuver in the current economic downturn .  
They looked forward to the publication of data on the external current and capital accounts in 1999 , consistent with Hong Kong SAR 's commitment under the SDDS , and urged publication of more timely and detailed data on fiscal developments .  
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
The Secretary for the Treasury , Miss Denise Yue , reiterated the Government 's aims to maintain sound and stable public finances and foster a fiscal environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
The Mission noted that Hong Kong has pursued an appropriately supportive fiscal policy during the economic recession experienced over the past two years .  It projected a deficit for 1999 / 2000 of 1.5% of GDP , against the government 's original forecast deficit equivalent to 3% of GDP .  
( a ) the situation will arise in which the fiscal reserves deposited by the Government in the Exchange Fund will be frozen and can not be withdrawn in order to pay for public expenditure , when a substantial amount of the assets of the Exchange Fund has been utilised for stabilizing the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong ;  
We aim to maintain sound and stable public finances and foster a fiscal environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
JCRA 's upgrade was based on Hong Kong 's recovery from the economic recession , the extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position that were not impaired by the financial crisis , and the reforms that had strengthened the currency board arrangements and enhanced the Government 's ability to fend off speculative pressure .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
He added that HK 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals , prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , and sound financial regulatory systems merit higher ratings for Hong Kong .  
The deficit of $ 7.8 billion and the closing balance of the fiscal reserves of $ 430.3 billion are the same as the provisional figures for the year which were published on April 28 , 2001 , pending the final closure of the annual accounts .  
" However , we consider that Hong Kong merits a higher rating , in view of our strong economic fundamentals which are supported by prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems , and stable economic development of the Mainland , " the spokesman said .  
" The actual timing of the implementation of the Advisory Committee 's recommendations , if accepted , remains the sole prerogative of the Government . I have no doubt that the Government will take into account relevant factors such as the projected fiscal position , the economic outlook , etc , before deciding on the timetable , " said Moses Cheng , Chairman of the Advisory Committee . 
First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Since its announcement on March 6 , this year 's Budget has drawn positive and generally supportive responses from Members of this Council , different sectors of the community and the public at large .  The Financial Secretary has outlined in the Budget the future direction of our economic development , our fiscal objectives and principles , as well as the role of the Administration in the economy .  
While a sharp fiscal correction during the cyclical downturn may not be warranted , the recent drift into a sizable structural deficit will need to be reversed in order to ensure healthy public finances in the longer run .  
Directors emphasized that the smooth functioning of the link will continue to depend critically on prudent fiscal policies , flexible goods and factor markets , a robust financial system , and large foreign reserves .  
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis . They were ( i ) fiscal policy in good and bad times ; ( ii ) financial systems and corporate governance ; ( iii ) exchange rate systems ; and ( iv ) potential regional economic arrangements for Asia .  
Otherwise , the public at large would criticize the Government for failing its responsibility .  It would be detrimental to the overall interests of the civil service and the community if our failure to implement the pay reduction led to the impression that civil servants were unwilling to share the burden with the rest of the community in time of difficulty or our inaction meant that our severe fiscal deficit could not be alleviated .  
" We note JCRA 's recognition that Hong Kong enjoys strong external position , high level of fiscal flexibility , a resilient financial sector and a high level of autonomy in many aspects , including the financial and legal systems , and that HK 's role as an international financial centre has remained intact , " a Government spokesman said .  
The meeting , to be held on September 5 and 6 , will focus on ways to strengthen global economic growth , combating terrorist financing and money laundering , advancing fiscal and financial reforms , and improving the allocation of domestic savings for economic development .  
This would not only increase the Government 's fiscal burden in the future by incurring substantial additional expenditure , but also fail to address the current structural problem of insufficient recurrent revenue to cover recurrent expenditure .  
We are determined to maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and will continue to take forward our constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law . We will restore our fiscal balance to foster an environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
* After implementation of the expenditure and revenue measures set out in the 2003-04 Budget Speech plus the remaining $ 6 billion additional revenue to be raised in the next few years , we forecast declining consolidated deficits and operating deficits in the coming years 2003-04 to 2005-06 and a return to fiscal balance from 2006-07 .  
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook , credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003 .  This will require the implementation of sizeable structural deficit reduction measures in fiscal year 2003 and a commitment to more substantial consolidation , supported by concrete measures , in the next three years . "  
A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
Britain is a prime example . After it became a welfare state in 1945 , the government took on the responsibility of caring for the poor , the handicapped , the sick , and the unemployed from cradle to grave , but a deepening fiscal crisis forced the government to raise taxes during the 1960 ' s .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
Easier said than done . Unfortunately , she also had to consider the fact that her women readers have become accustomed to a soft style of reporting that " does n't pose brain-bending problems . " She worried that readers would n't be able to digest a heavy dose of economic and fiscal issues added in to the discussion of family matters , and that sales would fall . In the end she decided not to take the risk of changing the format .  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .  
Dr . Hani introduced that the Afghan interim government submitted the government budget of the 2002 fiscal year of a total sum of 0.46-billion USD in the meeting of the Executive Team of Aids to Afghanistan held in April . Because the financial income of the interim government was very limited , there was a gap of 0.4-billion US dollars in the budget that needed to be filled up by international aids .

Companies , on behalf of their shareholders , make investment decisions based not only on geological criteria , but also on political , marketing , regulatory , fiscal , monetary , environmental , administrative , operational and profit criteria .  
A number of other policy considerations are involved in such a decision , but such a move would give a very powerful signal that a Government intends to achieve stable economic conditions through the necessary supporting fiscal and monetary policies .  
Governments in the region , by and large , have followed conservative fiscal and financial policies , enabling them to maintain reasonable degrees of economic stability coupled generally with sustained high levels of economic activity .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
Frequently absent is the necessary matrix of legislative , regulatory , financial and fiscal systems conducive to the creation of a favourable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurship and the private sector can contribute to economic development .

As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .  
UNDP assistance for the development of national capacity includes the reform of policies at the macro level thereby ensuring retention of qualified personnel , including fiscal polices , public administration law , civil service reform , including downsizing and the creation of professional incentives and more rational differentiation between salary scales .  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .

In practice , the ongoing reform of natural resource fiscal regimes in various countries has a long way to go in mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources and at the same time discouraging excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
At its twelfth meeting , the Group of Experts identified several high-priority areas , such as advice in policy formulation and implementation strategies , administrative restructuring for economic reform , people-oriented development , strategic fiscal and financial management , and strengthening of training in , for example , evaluation and management of change , in which Member States may seek technical help from United Nations agencies . 
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
Host Governments are expected to provide stable and transparent regulatory and fiscal environments including supportive administrative frameworks while at the same time providing acceptable socio-economic environments .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
The ongoing policy formulation with respect to mineral tenure development , investment codes , legal and fiscal frameworks , environmental management and social development is essential , along with the subsequent formalization through the legal system .  
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
The continued expansion of the aggregate output was accompanied by encouraging development in fiscal performance , with the central government budget operations producing a surplus of EC $ 3.7-million in 1994 as compared with EC $ 2.2-million recorded in 1993 . 
In Kuwait , although actual oil revenues were about 25 per cent higher than projected , and expenditures about 15 per cent lower than their planned level , the budget deficit remained sizeable in fiscal year 1995 / 96 , owing mainly to supplementary allocations for autonomous governmental institutions .  
Tax reform was a key component of the economic stabilization and revenue-generation programmes of many Governments , involving rationalization of the tariff structure and a lowering of import duties and excise taxes with a view to discouraging evasion and limiting disincentive effects ; fiscal decentralization policies , including the devolution of tax collection to lower levels of government , and the introduction of value-added tax ( VAT ) and presumptive taxation in order to broaden the tax base - e.g . , in Ghana , Nigeria and Zambia . 
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
It is currently coordinating with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) in the design of profiles for poverty alleviation policies in four specific sectors in Lebanon - namely , health , education , employment and fiscal policy .  With regard to the theme of social integration , ESCWA has established the first Arab regional computer training centre for blind women / girls , located in Amman , Jordan .  
Its strategy for promoting universal access to basic social services is threefold : ( a ) direct support to service delivery ; ( b ) capacity - building and social mobilization ; and ( c ) advocacy .  UNICEF emphasizes the need to sustain investment in children in good times and in bad , and in times of fiscal restraint and economic liberalization .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
The result was unrealistic national economic and fiscal policy-making , compounded by the poor administrative capacity of many governments to collect revenues .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
As argued in World Economic and Social Survey , 1997,3 Governments need to be sensitive to the fact that excessive enthusiasm for the quick reduction of budget deficits can have high economic and social cost and may not even be required for the fiscal probity that is indeed necessary in the medium run .  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
There is a widespread need for more coherent and consistent policies , legal frameworks , fiscal and budgetary processes , institutional mechanisms , communication and education programmes , and better coordination between environmental and other ministries .  
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
For some of its most active participants , this is an asset , since it will allow rapid development of international electronic trade flows with a minimum of legal , regulatory and fiscal obstacles .  
It also included an amount of $ 102,400 relating to an obligation raised for the purchase of a 4x4 medium heavy crane truck prior to the closing of the 30 June 1996 accounts which was inadvertently recorded in fiscal year 1997 .  
The problems of women in both urban and rural areas are such that women are not ready to become entrepreneurs because of insufficient start-up capital and managerial experience and an imperfect fiscal policy which does not suit everyone .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences105 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
With regard to budgetary allocations , the judiciary requested 750-million quetzales for fiscal year 1999 , based largely on the needs involved in the implementation of its modernization plan ; the executive branch assigned it 366.5-million quetzales in the regular budget .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
In preparing the forecast for regular budget cash balances at the end of 1999 , the major unknown variable is the amount to be received from the major contributor following that Member States anticipated national legislation for its fiscal year , which begins 1 October 1999 .  
In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences119 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences131 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
The agenda for the ninth meeting was based on the discussions during the eighth meeting of the Group of Experts and on important issues in international taxation in the context of prevailing international economic , fiscal and financial environment .  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
To achieve it , the Government decided to adopt a minimum programme of short-term actions which would make it possible to maintain the trend of a gradual increase in the tax burden in 1999 and to promote , together with the Commission , an extensive process of national consultation to define a long-term fiscal policy that would eliminate uncertainty by establishing clear , efficient and stable rules .  
Underscores that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow Up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and , therefore , stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
These measures include the reconstruction of homes destroyed in the war , as well as the building of new homes and communal and social infrastructure ; they also include fiscal and other measures , and encouraging balanced economic growth and development in such areas .  11 .  In 1997 , the National Programme for the Development of the Islands , and the Islands Act were adopted , based on the principle of sustainable development .  
The Chinese trajectory , however , where these factors are absent , also points to the decisive role of State capacity in the virtuous growth path that accompanied gradual and uneven institutional reforms over a period of two decades ( as exemplified in the agricultural reforms , the open-door policy , the transitional dual-track regime in industry and the change in the fiscal system Chavance , forthcoming in 2000 ) .  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
Underscores the fact that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and therefore stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
. . .  For the purpose of cooperation among States Parties to this Protocol , including , in particular , cooperation under article 9 of this Protocol , offences established in accordance with article 5 , paragraph 1 , of this Protocol shall not be considered fiscal offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic laws of the States Parties . 16 .  The title of article 18 bis should be amended to read as follows :  
In 1992 , the member countries signed the Maastricht Treaty , agreeing to eliminate over 280 physical , technical , and fiscal barriers to the creation of a single market , and moved one step closer to the final stage of currency union .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
A sustained and determined effort is necessary if the national peace agreements are to be fully implemented , particularly as concerns the fostering and protection of human rights , equal opportunities and judicial , fiscal and agrarian reform .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
These observations underscore the fact that the implementation of fiscal and economic policies by the Government and the use and distribution of national resources are carried out in such a way that most people are deprived of access to basic social and economic rights and opportunities , including access to education , health care , physical and mental integrity , water , food , etc .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences 102 ] or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
In fiscal 1998 the Bank allocated to the social sector US $ 8 , 480-million out of total lending of US $ 28 , 594-million , including US $ 1.9-billion for health , population and nutrition ; US $ 665 million for basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation facilities ; and US $ 3.1-billion for education , placing greater emphasis on primary education for girls , the rural poor and linguistic minorities .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
The policies and actions of international financial institutions that advocated such liberalization and stressed structural adjustment and fiscal prudence when the crisis struck were viewed by many as exacerbating the negative social impact of the crisis .  
First , trade liberalization and the demands of global capital markets and financial institutions have to varying extents constrained the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy options for social purposes , including employment and equity objectives .  
The larger fiscal deficit partially offset the fall in private domestic demand , while monetary policy makers maintained an austere stance until midway through the year .  
Consequently , peacekeeping operations were becoming larger and more costly , and total peacekeeping expenditure for the current fiscal year was expected to be more than double that for the preceding fiscal year .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Article 102 of the General Standards to Govern the Operations of the General Secretariat ( General Standards ) , adopted by the General Assembly , establishes that quotas shall be annual , paid within the deadline established during the year in question , and shall be considered due on the first day of the corresponding fiscal period , and Article 103 of the General Standards specifies that quota payments shall be credited against the balance pending from the earliest fiscal period for which the money is owed , unless the Permanent Council agrees otherwise .  
Also calls upon States and regional economic integration organizations to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the United Nations Environment Programme in order to support the interim arrangements and the operation of the Conference of the Parties until the end of the fiscal year in which the first meeting of the Conference of Parties takes place , and to ensure the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the further work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ;  
While it is true that East Timor must rely on its bilateral and multilateral partners and that the mission should not do anything that those partners are prepared to do , I nevertheless believe that there are vital parts of government , particularly in the areas mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report those of central management , fiscal management , justice and human rights , and security and national sovereignty where it would be entirely justified to place advisory staff and a small number of line managers in the East Timor Government . 
So it is also dependent on increasing resources over time , by making the most efficient use of the existing resources through proper fiscal , monetary , trade and competitive market practices , and by promoting the growth of resources and expanding the opportunities for trade .  
For the Meeting the UNCTAD secretariat had prepared an issues note that identified and described six broad areas of HCMs : information provision and technical assistance ; financial support ; fiscal incentives ; investment insurance ; investment-related trade measures influencing the volume , sectoral composition and geographical distribution of FDI in host countries through market access preferences and export promotion devices ; and measures geared specifically to the facilitation of transfer of technology .  
These measures included , in particular , improving the policy and operational framework for FDI , so as to put it on a par with best practice ; rationalizing fiscal incentives ; setting up a super agency to promote and facilitate investment ; fast-tracking privatization ; and implementing strategies for upgrading the human capital base .  
Following an exhaustive search and interview procedure that won compliments from Kosovo political leaders for its transparency and the subsequent appointment of a new General Director of RTK and , the first tranche of funding from the European Agency for Reconstruction ( EAR ) for RTK was approved in March , and a tripartite agreement was signed among EAR , RTK and OSCE , which clarifies the responsibilities of each party for monitoring the performance and fiscal accountability of RTK .  
The debtor LDCs will aim at maximizing benefits from debt relief by creating a conducive national framework including fiscal reforms , a budgetary framework , sectoral adjustments , contributing to poverty eradication and faster economic growth , export growth , increased investment , enhanced productive capacities , employment and productivity , savings and international competitiveness .  
In order to achieve economic development , the Government intended to apply strict fiscal and budgetary measures , holding inflation at about 3 per cent , enhancing the competitiveness of the domestic economy and improving the business environment so as to promote the development of the private sector .

For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
The Central Economic Work Conference held in November 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .  
So acting in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee and the Central Economic Work Conference , stressing the central link of state-owned enterprise [ SOE ] reform , and continuing to promote all reforms such as fiscal , financial , circulation , S &amp; T , education , housing , social security , and income distribution , will be crucial to clearing the system obstacles to promoting demand and improving supply , to establish the necessary system climate .  
Having coolly analyzed the economic situation at the time , carried out thorough investigation and study , and extensively listened to the suggestions and views of experts and scholars , the central authorities held a timely meeting , looked into and set out a policy of further strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , and readjusted the intensity and specific measures of the fiscal policy .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
For the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .  Despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .  
Judging from the actual needs of the current national economic growth , Xiang Huaicheng said , the proactive fiscal policy still requires the necessary policy efforts in order to achieve the goals of ultimately expanding internal demand and promoting steady economic growth and to provide guarantee for quality and efficient development in national economic restructuring and scientific and technological advancement .  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
Traditional industries are still the principal bodies in Liaoning , which is an old industrial base , and to a great extent , state-owned industries manifest the model of speed and efficiency .  The state 's efforts to stimulate domestic demand , and gradually put the proactive fiscal policy into place , have produced a certain effect of stimulating the market for Liaoning industries .  
In the face of the new situation of insufficient effective demand in the last two years , the central government put forward the fundamental policy of expanding demand and implemented a proactive fiscal policy and other supporting macroeconomic policies .  It issued additional treasury bonds and increased investment in infrastructure construction and technological transformation to bring along bank lending and nongovernmental investment and expand investment demand .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
For the state to set aside some fiscal revenue to ensure the basic living needs and reemployment of laid-off state enterprise workers is not only the demand of implementing the party 's program of wholehearted service for the people , but is also the requirement of creating and stable social environment for the continued development of reform and construction .  
Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
Through continuing to deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , we should establish a complete and unified fiscal and taxation system , and expand the sources of government revenue ; we must also strengthen fiscal and tax management and ensure that all collectable revenue is collected , put a stop to artificial revenue loss , rationally arrange fiscal funds , pay attention to returns in the use of funds , oppose extravagance and waste , and promote thrift and economy .  
In order to increase domestic demand and stimulate economic growth , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council pursued a proactive fiscal policy for three consecutive years , thus creating a fine macroeconomic environment for the process of reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
In recent years , the Central Committee has addressed the problems of overproduction and constant lowering of prices in China . In order to curb the trend of deflation , the Central Committee authoritatively made major policy decisions that included increasing domestic demand , the implementing positive fiscal policy , and stable and healthy currency policy studies .  They decided to issue more national bonds and increase infrastructure construction .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
The continual loss of resources of state authority and economic and fiscal resources supporting such authority resources makes the government 's command implementation mechanisms exist in name only , rendering the state totally incapable of fighting big entrenched benefit-distribution groups in society and criminal groups in society .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
The continuous growth of the tax revenue has contributed significantly to the increased financial strength of various levels of government , effective implementation of the proactive fiscal policy , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .

During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
financial fraud and violations of fiscal and economic discipline are widespread ; there is fraud and deception in tendering for construction projects , and the quality of some projects is inferior ; the cultural markets are chaotic ; and major and serious safety accidents occur from time to time in production operations .  Some new characteristics have recently emerged in illegal activities , such as crimes being committed by syndicates , transregional crimes , crimes committed by collusion between outside and inside , specialized crime , and intellectualized crime .  
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng pointed out at today 's fiscal work forum that China will continue to conscientiously implement a proactive fiscal policy , consolidate and standardize the economic order , promote the sustained , healthy and rapid development of the national economy , ensure a steady improvement in the people 's livelihood , maintain social stability , and promote economic restructuring in its fiscal work in the second half of the year .  
We must accord full importance to the functions and role of public finance , implement a correct fiscal policy , and readjust and optimize the composition of outlays in a timely way in order to better serve the development of advanced productive forces and the promotion of the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
Third , efforts must be made to maintain the country 's long-term peace and stability by taking further steps to ensure fiscal outlays for public security organs , procuratorial organs , people 's courts , judicial departments and other law-enforcement organs , giving positive assistance to the departments concerned in strengthening the comprehensive improvement of public order , energetically consolidating economic order in the marketplace and strictly cracking down on major crimes .  
China 's healthy and steady economic growth over many years is an expression of the state 's unswerving implementation of correct economic policies , including the active fiscal policy , reform of state enterprises , reform of the financial setup , reform of grain circulation , reform of the social security system , and economic restructuring , which is listed as the focal point in work this year .  
According to the latest statistics released by the People 's Bank of China , the country 's moderate fiscal policy has yielded desired results , and the country 's stable and healthy financial conditions during the first half of this year have proved to be strong support for both its economic restructuring and its sustained national economic growth .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
At the National Audit Working Forum held here today , Li Jinhua , auditor-general of the National Audit Office , said that since the " Audit Law " was promulgated six years ago , budget execution audit has played a positive role in safeguarding the financial and economic order , driving the reform of the fiscal system , reinforcing budget management , promoting administration by law , and strengthening the building of clean and honest administration .  
At meetings in Beidaihe , the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically discussed problems China would face after joining the WTO . The Political Bureau has decided to set up a WTO-accession financial and fiscal work leading group .  Led by Wen Jiabao , vice premier of the State Council , the leading group will call a national financial and fiscal work meeting in November . The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
It was learned that the leading group led by Wen Jiabao is drafting a report on China 's financial and fiscal structure after the WTO accession .  The report will give a comprehensive assessment of China 's financial and fiscal situations in terms of legal system , organization , operation , and personnel , and propose countermeasures for a series of problems China will face after its entry to the WTO , such as capital drain , unhealthy competition in the credit market , and risks arising from international speculative activities in the stock market .  
Discussing the proactive fiscal policy in depth is conducive to helping us unify our thought and formulate and implement the active fiscal policy more rationally and with a more scientific approach .  It is even more conducive to promoting the smooth implementation of the macro-economic policy and the sustained and healthy development of our economy .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
After 20 years of economic reform and development , a mechanism of steady growth in fiscal revenue compatible with socialist market economy has been basically established .  It has demonstrated tremendous vitality .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The implementation of the proactive fiscal policy has protected social stability , maintained the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy , and improved the people 's living standards although it has also increased deficits and debts .  
According to experts , China has an ample supply of resources and a surplus of productive capacity .  A buyers ' market is taking shape and there is substantial material guarantee .  An increase in fiscal deficits and government debts can arouse the hidden production factors and stimulate economic growth .  
The theme of the fiscal budget is " scaling new heights , " which is exactly an ardent aspiration shared by some 7 million Hong Kong residents .  After enduring the financial storm over the past two years , quite a few residents have sustained such blows as salary cuts or lay-offs .  However , they have carried forward the spirit of working hard despite hardships and accepted the challenge from a new century marked by knowledge economy .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .  
The national defense budget for this fiscal year will be raised by 12.7 percent ; the task of cutting 500,000 military personnel set three years ago has been completed ;  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .

At the end of 1998 , Japan began implementing the proactive fiscal policy and the unbalanced budget , slashed income taxes and taxes for legal persons , and increased public investment by issuing a large amount of treasury bonds , in an effort to promote the economic recovery .  
US President Clinton recently submitted to Congress the national defense budget for fiscal 2001 ; the total amount of the budget is $ 305.4 billion , an increase of $ 16.5 billion - - 5.7 percent - - over that of fiscal 2000 ; the figure represents over one-third of total global military expenditure and is equivalent to the total expenditure of the eight countries ( regions ) which rank after the United States .  
The total amount for the county as a whole reached over 20 million yuan a year ; but , to make up for their respective fiscal shortfalls , the townships basically diverted all of the money .  As peasants were not able to benefit from contributing to the public accumulation fund , they naturally became unwilling to pay this " for nothing " money which , seeming clear , was a confused matter .  
In Fuyang City where township finance is mainly dependent on taxes and fees levied on peasants , the tax and fee reform reduced the county 's fiscal supply capability by a half .  Under the fiscal pressure , the townships had no way out , but could only resort to cutting personnel , operations , spending , and bureaucracy and have worked to establish rigid mechanisms constraining the size of government .  
Originally , it was believed that the Senate would pass the bill without problem .  However , all of a sudden , halfway , out rushed a " Cheng Yaojin [ a character in a Chinese story ] , " who claimed that the Senate would not act as " rubber stamp " and demanded that some bills with strong colors of the US bipartisan political struggle , such as the bill on fiscal appropriations , and so on , be deliberated and examined together with the bill on granting the PNTR status to China .  
Part of that , 191.053 billion yuan , was used to repay the principal and interest of internal and external debts ; 179.16 billion yuan was spent reducing the deficit for the year ; and the remaining 1.29 billion yuan was used to replenish the central fiscal sinking fund .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : The fiscal revenue at the central level in 1999 increased by 95.721 billion yuan over the previous year , accounting for 61 percent of the increment in the total national fiscal revenue .  It not only enabled the proportion of the national fiscal revenue in the GDP to continue on a rising curve , from 12.4 percent in 1998 to 13.9 percent in 1999 , but also increased the proportion of the central fiscal revenue in the national fiscal revenue from 49.5 percent in 1998 to 51.1 percent in 1999 .  
Regarding the arrangement for , and use of , the central fiscal expenditure , Xiang Huaicheng said : In the area of central fiscal expenditure , we have conscientiously implemented the strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision of the second session of the Ninth NPC .  It has played a positive role in such areas as promoting the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy ; helping state enterprises intensify their reforms ;  
and improving the people 's living standard and safeguarding social stability .  With a conscientious and responsible attitude , we have implemented well the positive fiscal policies and worked hard to give play to the role of the treasury in macroregulation and control ;  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Auditing Administration conducted the audit and did a tremendous amount work on the execution of the 1999 central budget and other fiscal income and expenditure as well as the management and utilization of the 1998 state bonds special funds , thereby playing an active supervisory role in safeguarding the state financial and economic order .  
Economic experts here said that the good trend of national economic operation and the smooth progress in the reform and turnaround of state enterprises are the result of the implementation of both the CPC Central Committee and State Council measure to expand domestic demand and the pro-active fiscal policy .  Measures to crack down hard on smuggling and to encourage exports have provided a favorable external environment and market space for the turnaround of state enterprises .  
Since the proactive fiscal policy was put into practice in the second half of 1998 , the Chinese Government has cumulatively issued around 270 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds and the funds raised through the bonds have mainly been used for infrastructure construction , technological transformation , environmental protection and ecological projects , and the construction of educational and cultural facilities .  
To avoid the possible economic downturn and to maintain sustained rapid healthy national economic development , the central authorities have resolutely made major policy decisions to expand domestic demand and implement the proactive fiscal policy .  
In light of the new situation of economic operations in 1999 , the central authorities continued to implement the proactive fiscal policy and , on the basis of the planned long-term treasury bond issue worth 50 billion yuan , further issued 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds . 
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
To maintain the good momentum in economic development in the current situation , we should step up our efforts to implement the proactive fiscal policy and do all we can to better achieve the planned targets for this year so that a solid foundation will be laid for economic development and social stability .  
The reporters have learned from the national fiscal work conference being held here that an important turn for the better appeared in China 's economy during the first half of the year , and the proactive fiscal policy practiced by the Chinese government played a dominant role in the improvement .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : Through reforms , the government will further improve the existing taxation system .  It will establish a tax collection and management system that is solid in basic management , advanced in the means of collection and management , and separated in collection , management , and inspection .  This system , which will integrate law enforcement with service , will close tax loopholes and promote the steady increase of fiscal revenues .  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
Recently , individuals in economic circles have pointed out that the major turnaround we are seeing in macroeconomic operations shows that the various macroeconomic regulatory measures - - primarily the aggressive fiscal policies - - implemented by China are having a significant positive effect , creating a golden historical opportunity for China 's economic development .  
In keeping with the operational state of the national economy , China 's financial expenditures and outlays maintained fairly rapid growth during the first half of the year , with fiscal revenues coming to 624 billion yuan , an increase of 94.6 billion yuan ( or 17.9% ) over the same period last year , while nationwide fiscal outlays came to 583.8 billion yuan , an increase of 119.0 billion yuan ( or 25.6% ) over the same period the previous year . 
ensure the sustained rapid and stable growth of fiscal revenue ; redress the local and departmental policies of levying taxes first before returning them to the central government ;  
Through system renovations and supporting reforms , fully mobilize the enthusiasm for creativeness on the part of personnel of various categories , advance the development of outstanding personnel , and enhance public institutions ' vigor and capacity for self-development , thereby reducing the state 's fiscal burdens and enhancing the development of high-quality , socialized professional and technical personnel .  
Organization and personnel departments at all levels should fully perform their functions of providing macro-level regulation and operational guidance , successfully carry out the work of initiating and coordinating efforts , act in close coordination with personnel planning , fiscal , labor , and social security agencies as well as sectoral agencies in charge of science , education , culture , health , information , and publishing , so as to form a joint force and carry out concerted efforts to successfully complete this work .  
In short , the work of institutional reform is proceeding in an orderly manner in various areas .  The focus of the next step of reform is to vigorously proceed with the institutional reform of the cities , counties , and townships , changing functions , optimizing personnel structures , reducing fiscal and peasant burdens , and improving work efficiency and service quality .  It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and study and to get well prepared for work in all areas .  
Chen Guangyi said : While constantly deepening reform and accelerating restructuring , we should now continue to implement the proactive fiscal policy and maintain the necessary efforts .  The State Council has proposed that 50 billion yuan of additional long-term treasure bonds for raising construction funds be issued by the Ministry of Finance through commercial banks in the second half of this year , and the central budget be readjusted accordingly .  The proposed measures are necessary .  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
The secret national defense budget for next fiscal year will total more than 58 billion yuan .  To strengthen their combat readiness in the electronic and communications arenas , the plans proposed by the armed forces include completion of an electronic counterattack shelter network and an online defense system .  Geared against Chicom 's active efforts to develop electromagnetic impulse attack , there will also be a " project to protect against electromagnetic impulse . "  
With regard to measures against missiles , although the TMD system being developed is a thing in the far distant future , in the next fiscal year the national armed forces will still invest more than 6 billion yuan to build up joint air defense and counterattack capabilities .  
On the one hand , the state will continue to pursue an expansive fiscal policy and issue additional treasury bonds ; the technical-transformation projects supported by the state will be carried out step by step .  In addition , investment in the western region will increase , enterprises will recover their confidence in investment , and an internal driving force for promoting the growth of investment will be gradually strengthened .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
The Chinese government made flexible use of fiscal policies in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation to promote the sustainable , rapid and sound development of the national economy during the Ninth FYP period , thus making an important contribution to the enrichment of experience in macro-control .  
Second , in light of changes in the situation after China 's entry into the World Trade Organization , it will continue to deepen the reform of the fiscal revenue system , further improve the revenue-sharing system between the central and local governments , positively promote the reform of the fiscal budget system , improve the system of the transfer of payments by the Treasury , actively and steadily promote the transformation of administrative fees into taxes , and gradually establish a public financial framework that meets the needs of the socialist market economy .  
According to Wang Jun , the Ministry of Finance has adjusted its internal mechanism and functions to meet the requirements of the establishment of the new fiscal expenditure management system this year after fully taking into consideration the needs of major financial reforms such as the unified control of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds and the establishment of a centralized system of receipt and payment by the Treasury .  
The state will very soon publish the favored treatment measures for supporting the great development of west China , including intensifying the shift of fiscal expenditure and construction funds , speeding up the pace of reforms and opening up in the western regions , and encouraging foreign businesses and other regions of China to invest in the west , and so on .  
In order to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development during the 10th Five-year Plan , we should continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a steady monetary policy , so as to spur investment and consumption and encourage exports .  
He expressed his concern for the sustainability of China 's medium-term fiscal policies , considering in particular the contingent liability of the financial sector as well as possible expenditures for the social security net , pension funds , infrastructure construction and environmental protection in future .  
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng stressed at the closing ceremony : As our country 's fiscal work will be faced with great opportunities and challenges in the new century , we must adapt to changes in the environment both at home and abroad , firmly grasp the initiative in fiscal work , and concentrate efforts on structuring a framework of public finance suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy and on building stable , balanced , and strong state finances to better serve the overall interests of economic and social development .  
Xiang Huaicheng demanded : With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , comrades engaged in fiscal work must conscientiously change their mentality by changing their thinking from that of the planned finance in the past to that of public finance . 
In addition , we must strengthen the development of the contingent of cadres and try hard to build a contingent of fiscal and financial cadres who are smart and capable , highly efficient , honest , and pragmatic .  
On the basis of making a thorough analysis of the situation and assuming overall responsibility , the party and government judged the hour and sized up the situation , pooled the masses ' wisdom , and put forward a series of major measures for enlivening the economy and stimulating demand : Putting into effect an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy ;  
In accordance with the demands of economic development , we have upheld the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continued to implement an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , vigorously pushed economic restructuring , strengthened the agricultural foundation , intensified the work of extricating state enterprises from difficulties , instituted the strategy of major development of west China , and adopted various means to expand exports .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
If the fund is used in advance , the authorities will have no money to use once an incident occurs.Last year , the old authorities agreed to release a special fund in NT $ 14.3 billion before the new fiscal year began to help resolve financial problems faced by counties and cities .  
During the election days , he proposed that a total of $ 1,300 billion should be cut in taxes within the coming nine years starting fiscal year 2002 .  This will include lowering all income tax rates , doubling the tax relief for child-raising , providing tax cuts for married couples , abolishing the federal inheritance tax , and increasing tax reductions on charity donations .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In 1998 , the CPC Central Committee decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to overcome the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis , expand domestic demand , and maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy national development .  
Facts have proved that implementation of a proactive fiscal policy and issuance of government bonds for long-term development to increase investment is a correct policy decision adopted by the party Central Committee . It represents a successful practice of ours in resolving problems that we encounter on the way forward through continued development and in adjusting our macroeconomic control policies in a timely manner in light of changes at home and abroad .  
The overall living standard has witnessed a historic change from simply having enough food and clothing to leading a relatively comfortable life .  Compared with 1995 , Xinjiang 's fiscal revenue nearly doubled to 13.55 billion yuan , with annual growth of 14.5 percent .  
Accordingly , in addition to continuing to implement aggressive fiscal policies , we must make a major effort to intensify structural reforms , stimulating the intrinsic driving forces behind economic development , developing new sources of motive power for economic growth , gradually reducing the degree to which economic growth relies on aggressive fiscal policies , and creating a mechanism for sustained , stable development .  
Thanks to the efforts to continuously carry out the pro-active fiscal policy , major expenditures were basically guaranteed and a bigger stride was taken toward the reform of the budget system .  The guiding ideologies , principles , and focus of the 2001 plan for national economic and social development and the 2001 budget arrangements are correct and reflect the spirit of the 15th National Party Congress and the fifth plenary session of the 15th CPC Central Committee . The general arrangements are basically feasible .  
When inspecting Fort Stewart military base as commander-in-chief of armed forces for the first time on Monday this week , Bush announced that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year would be increased by another $ 14 billion , bringing the total US military budget to $ 31 billion .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
The year 2000 was the third year in which the country implemented an active fiscal policy .  As result of the investment projects , financed with the capital obtained from floating national bonds , the economic growth increased 1.7 percent .  That was another significant contribution the active financial policy made for the national economic growth following the additional economic growths of 1.5 and 2 percent 1998 and 1999 , respectively .  
Facts have proved : The Chinese Government is right in adopting the active fiscal policy ; that the results obtained from this active fiscal policy of floating more national bonds and invest the money in building more infrastructure projects are remarkable ; and that building more key projects and pooling the resources on building some large projects that China wanted to build but was unable to build can help economic restructuring , improve the quality of economic growth , and improve enterprises ' economic performance .  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Financial and Economic Committee maintained that the 2001 central and local budgets have been arranged continuously according to the requirements set forth in the proactive fiscal policy .  In arranging expenditures , attention has been paid to increasing expenditures on agriculture , education , and science and technology ;  
In accordance with the requirement of developing the socialist market economy and the principle of making financial authority correspond to administrative authority , it is necessary to rationally divide the financial authority and administrative authority of governments at all levels , enhance their functions of financial redistribution , improve the method of using central revenue to subsidize local expenditures , and gradually establish a standardized system of fiscal transfers of payments and improve the fiscal system .  
We should adhere to the policy of expanding domestic demand and continue to follow a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy so as to promote the steady growth of effective demand and the adjustment of economic structure .  We should strengthen the foundation position of agriculture , increase peasants ' income , and consolidate and expand results in helping state-owned enterprises carry out reform and eliminate deficits .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .  
With reserves of that size , he said , Hong Kong had a government with no debt ; accumulated fiscal reserves around US $ 48 billion ; a simple tax system and corporate and personal taxes at a level amongst the lowest in the world . 
" The success of this two-pronged approach is evidenced by the fact that we have not only raised sufficient revenue to meet our spending needs but we have also built up a very healthy level of fiscal reserves . 
On fiscal policy , Mr Kwong said : " Our sound financial position depends largely on our strict discipline in controlling expenditure and our efforts in maintaining a stable and productive revenue base .  
These are a high savings rate , a dedicated and flexible labour force with good education and professional training , a well - established and properly supervised banking sector , advanced infrastructure for the financial markets , fiscal and monetary prudence , a government supporting the private sector but not imposing government leadership on economic development , and last but not the least , the rule of law . 
The guarantees of a high degree of autonomy contained in the Basic Law , free-market policies , prudent fiscal management , the rule of law , a level playing field , a highly-efficient civil service , and vigorous anti-corruption action were also major factors in Hong Kong 's continued success .  
My Administration will work to preserve Hong Kong 's special characteristics - the rule of law ; open and accountable government ; prudent fiscal policies ; low and predictable taxes ; personal , social and economic freedoms , and a civil service that is efficient and honest .  
The IMF Mission noted that the existing policy framework , including the linked exchange rate system , prudent fiscal policy , careful supervision of the financial sector and non-interventionist approach in factor markets , has proved to be effective and resilient in withstanding external pressures on the Hong Kong market .  
In our view , the existing policy framework - which includes the linked exchange rate system , a prudent fiscal policy , the careful supervision of the financial sector , and a non-interventionist approach to factor markets - has been extremely successful in fostering strong and sustainable growth in the past . 
As these receipts are expected to moderate , the surplus would narrow automatically in the coming fiscal year , but remain at a comfortable level .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
" Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
" One of the reasons that we are able to look beyond the hard times to a bright future for Hong Kong is that we have the powerful backing of our nation .  In addition , we have ample fiscal reserves , sound banking systems , as well as the resilience and wisdom of the people of Hong Kong , which will be brought into fuller play under the principle of ' Hong Kong people running Hong Kong ' . "  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - - if not the first - - to rebound .  
" We possess strong economic fundamentals , with a high saving rate , large fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves and a remarkable productivity capacity .  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - if not the first - to rebound . 
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
During the recent financial turmoil in Asia , the Government of the HKSAR , with its stable public finances and healthy fiscal reserves , has formulated on its own appropriate measures to deal with the problem and has successfully maintained the stability of the linked exchange rate .  Hong Kong continues to prosper and maintain its status as a leading international shipping , trade , financial and business centre .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .  Year after year , since the linked exchange rate was established , our fiscal reserves every year average about 2% of GDP . And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's solid economic foundation , strong fiscal reserves as well as sound banking and financial practices are the principal factors that will help Hong Kong recover sooner than most of its neighbours .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
" We have in place a business friendly environment , a prudent fiscal policy , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services .  
We have a free and open economy ; excellent regulatory systems ; huge fiscal and foreign reserves ; tried , tested and successful fiscal policies ; level playing field for all who do business here ; a vigorous anti-corruption commission ; a versatile and flexible workforce ; and world class infrastructure and communication .  
Banks ' finances are generally healthy and well cushioned , the Government holds substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves and is not burdened by any public debt , the corporate sector is slimming and rationalising its operations for greater efficiency and competitiveness , the labour force is adapting promptly to more stringent employment conditions , inflation is moderating , and the economy as a whole is displaying the profound flexibility that is indeed required for it to weather the present difficulties . 
This is underpinned in particular by sustained high economic growth and further reform and opening up in the Mainland will provide ample opportunities for Hong Kong . Additionally , our past prudent financial management has produced very strong fiscal reserve which will provide a solid base for a strong recovery in a not too distant future . "  
" To maintain our US / HK dollar link , we have an effective currency board system backed by the third largest foreign reserves in the world , a high savings rate , a strong fiscal position with no government foreign debt , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent , flexible , labour force and first-class infrastructure . "  
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
But I can say for sure that our financial foundation is very solid , our monetary system is robust , our currency , backed up by the currency board arrangement , is stable .  Our policies to stick to the linked exchange rate system and prudent fiscal management will remain unchanged .  
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
" We represent the model of sound economic management in the region : a truly free market operating under the rule of law ; a well-regulated financial sector ; and a clean government that has exercised great prudence in fiscal management , " he said .  
Our primary aim is to maintain sound and stable public finances and foster a fiscal environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
We also are determined to uphold the rule of law , the free market principles , clean and efficient government , sound and transparent regulations and prudent fiscal management , the hallmarks of our past success .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
In this context , we attach particular importance to developing and releasing data on the external current and capital accounts , and to publishing more timely and detailed data on fiscal developments ( including the consolidated funds ) .

" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
The IMF also commended the Government 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Government 's room for manoeuvre in the current economic downturn .  
Directors commended the Hong Kong SARG 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Hong Kong SARG 's room for maneuver in the current economic downturn .  
They looked forward to the publication of data on the external current and capital accounts in 1999 , consistent with Hong Kong SAR 's commitment under the SDDS , and urged publication of more timely and detailed data on fiscal developments .  
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
The Secretary for the Treasury , Miss Denise Yue , reiterated the Government 's aims to maintain sound and stable public finances and foster a fiscal environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
The Mission noted that Hong Kong has pursued an appropriately supportive fiscal policy during the economic recession experienced over the past two years .  It projected a deficit for 1999 / 2000 of 1.5% of GDP , against the government 's original forecast deficit equivalent to 3% of GDP .  
( a ) the situation will arise in which the fiscal reserves deposited by the Government in the Exchange Fund will be frozen and can not be withdrawn in order to pay for public expenditure , when a substantial amount of the assets of the Exchange Fund has been utilised for stabilizing the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong ;  
We aim to maintain sound and stable public finances and foster a fiscal environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
JCRA 's upgrade was based on Hong Kong 's recovery from the economic recession , the extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position that were not impaired by the financial crisis , and the reforms that had strengthened the currency board arrangements and enhanced the Government 's ability to fend off speculative pressure .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
He added that HK 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals , prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , and sound financial regulatory systems merit higher ratings for Hong Kong .  
The deficit of $ 7.8 billion and the closing balance of the fiscal reserves of $ 430.3 billion are the same as the provisional figures for the year which were published on April 28 , 2001 , pending the final closure of the annual accounts .  
" However , we consider that Hong Kong merits a higher rating , in view of our strong economic fundamentals which are supported by prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems , and stable economic development of the Mainland , " the spokesman said .  
" The actual timing of the implementation of the Advisory Committee 's recommendations , if accepted , remains the sole prerogative of the Government . I have no doubt that the Government will take into account relevant factors such as the projected fiscal position , the economic outlook , etc , before deciding on the timetable , " said Moses Cheng , Chairman of the Advisory Committee . 
First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Since its announcement on March 6 , this year 's Budget has drawn positive and generally supportive responses from Members of this Council , different sectors of the community and the public at large .  The Financial Secretary has outlined in the Budget the future direction of our economic development , our fiscal objectives and principles , as well as the role of the Administration in the economy .  
While a sharp fiscal correction during the cyclical downturn may not be warranted , the recent drift into a sizable structural deficit will need to be reversed in order to ensure healthy public finances in the longer run .  
Directors emphasized that the smooth functioning of the link will continue to depend critically on prudent fiscal policies , flexible goods and factor markets , a robust financial system , and large foreign reserves .  
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis . They were ( i ) fiscal policy in good and bad times ; ( ii ) financial systems and corporate governance ; ( iii ) exchange rate systems ; and ( iv ) potential regional economic arrangements for Asia .  
Otherwise , the public at large would criticize the Government for failing its responsibility .  It would be detrimental to the overall interests of the civil service and the community if our failure to implement the pay reduction led to the impression that civil servants were unwilling to share the burden with the rest of the community in time of difficulty or our inaction meant that our severe fiscal deficit could not be alleviated .  
" We note JCRA 's recognition that Hong Kong enjoys strong external position , high level of fiscal flexibility , a resilient financial sector and a high level of autonomy in many aspects , including the financial and legal systems , and that HK 's role as an international financial centre has remained intact , " a Government spokesman said .  
The meeting , to be held on September 5 and 6 , will focus on ways to strengthen global economic growth , combating terrorist financing and money laundering , advancing fiscal and financial reforms , and improving the allocation of domestic savings for economic development .  
This would not only increase the Government 's fiscal burden in the future by incurring substantial additional expenditure , but also fail to address the current structural problem of insufficient recurrent revenue to cover recurrent expenditure .  
We are determined to maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and will continue to take forward our constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law . We will restore our fiscal balance to foster an environment conducive to continued economic growth and success .  
* After implementation of the expenditure and revenue measures set out in the 2003-04 Budget Speech plus the remaining $ 6 billion additional revenue to be raised in the next few years , we forecast declining consolidated deficits and operating deficits in the coming years 2003-04 to 2005-06 and a return to fiscal balance from 2006-07 .  
Despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook , credible fiscal consolidation has to begin in fiscal year 2003 .  This will require the implementation of sizeable structural deficit reduction measures in fiscal year 2003 and a commitment to more substantial consolidation , supported by concrete measures , in the next three years . "  
A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
Britain is a prime example . After it became a welfare state in 1945 , the government took on the responsibility of caring for the poor , the handicapped , the sick , and the unemployed from cradle to grave , but a deepening fiscal crisis forced the government to raise taxes during the 1960 ' s .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
Easier said than done . Unfortunately , she also had to consider the fact that her women readers have become accustomed to a soft style of reporting that " does n't pose brain-bending problems . " She worried that readers would n't be able to digest a heavy dose of economic and fiscal issues added in to the discussion of family matters , and that sales would fall . In the end she decided not to take the risk of changing the format .  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .  
Dr . Hani introduced that the Afghan interim government submitted the government budget of the 2002 fiscal year of a total sum of 0.46-billion USD in the meeting of the Executive Team of Aids to Afghanistan held in April . Because the financial income of the interim government was very limited , there was a gap of 0.4-billion US dollars in the budget that needed to be filled up by international aids .

Political , regulatory , investment , fiscal , environmental and monetary issues have emerged as significant in encouraging direct foreign investment in mineral exploration .  
Companies , on behalf of their shareholders , make investment decisions based not only on geological criteria , but also on political , marketing , regulatory , fiscal , monetary , environmental , administrative , operational and profit criteria .  
A number of other policy considerations are involved in such a decision , but such a move would give a very powerful signal that a Government intends to achieve stable economic conditions through the necessary supporting fiscal and monetary policies .  
Governments in the region , by and large , have followed conservative fiscal and financial policies , enabling them to maintain reasonable degrees of economic stability coupled generally with sustained high levels of economic activity .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
Frequently absent is the necessary matrix of legislative , regulatory , financial and fiscal systems conducive to the creation of a favourable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurship and the private sector can contribute to economic development .

As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
It is thanks to contractionary fiscal policies and not to the alleged financing of drug trafficking that the consolidated public sector has been in equilibrium or in surplus in recent years , allowing the Government to reduce the remainder of the country 's external debt and make prepayments of acquired undertakings with international banks .

The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
No mechanism exists by which the major economies can be induced to make globally beneficial structural change in their own economies , or to adopt more globally responsible economic , fiscal and monetary policies .  
Even if it were assumed that globalization was an integral aspect of the normative structure of the established international economic system , the concerns expressed by the Group of 77 and others would seem to require additional antidotes , such as the establishment , for preventative purposes , of sound fiscal and monetary policies and early-warning systems , or normative counter-weights .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
Finally , sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a government which is transparent and accountable will also help to provide the confidence needed to attract private sector investment that is critical to growth and job creation . 
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
To provide information , within the Security Commission , on the respective military and public security expenditures approved in their budgets for the current fiscal year , taking as a reference the " Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures " adopted by the United Nations on 12 December 1990 , under the provisions of article 52 ( k ) of this Treaty ; and ,  
To consider the information provided by the Governments on their respective military and security budgets for the current fiscal year and to elaborate joint proposals for the possible adaptation of future budgets , taking into account the internal situation of each State ;  
In practice , the ongoing reform of natural resource fiscal regimes in various countries has a long way to go in mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources and at the same time discouraging excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources .  
The domestic factors include : civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some LDCs and the resulting social and economic burdens , political instability , macroeconomic imbalances , manifested in large fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits , in many cases the unfavourable short-term impact of macroeconomic policy adjustments on specific areas , in particular the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the population , and poor performance of the productive sectors including lack of adequate physical infrastructure .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
At its twelfth meeting , the Group of Experts identified several high-priority areas , such as advice in policy formulation and implementation strategies , administrative restructuring for economic reform , people-oriented development , strategic fiscal and financial management , and strengthening of training in , for example , evaluation and management of change , in which Member States may seek technical help from United Nations agencies . 
The United Nations will assist Governments in creating and strengthening national capacities in fiscal policy analysis and economic management and in designing strategies aimed at creating and improving a proper environment and regulatory framework for capital flows for productive investments , promoting private sector development and increasing transparency and accountability . 
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
Host Governments are expected to provide stable and transparent regulatory and fiscal environments including supportive administrative frameworks while at the same time providing acceptable socio-economic environments .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
The ongoing policy formulation with respect to mineral tenure development , investment codes , legal and fiscal frameworks , environmental management and social development is essential , along with the subsequent formalization through the legal system .  
Provide funding for research on and assistance in the development and implementation of appropriate mineral resource , investment , legal , fiscal , environmental and other related policy and procedural frameworks to improve the enabling environment in order to attract and secure long-term private investment ;  
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
On the one hand , Argentina , Mexico and , to some extent , Uruguay had to manage their economic policies in a climate marked by a sharp contraction of external financing , in which they faced severe slumps in domestic demand , with adverse effects on output and fiscal revenues .  
The continued expansion of the aggregate output was accompanied by encouraging development in fiscal performance , with the central government budget operations producing a surplus of EC $ 3.7-million in 1994 as compared with EC $ 2.2-million recorded in 1993 . 
In Kuwait , although actual oil revenues were about 25 per cent higher than projected , and expenditures about 15 per cent lower than their planned level , the budget deficit remained sizeable in fiscal year 1995 / 96 , owing mainly to supplementary allocations for autonomous governmental institutions .  
Tax reform was a key component of the economic stabilization and revenue-generation programmes of many Governments , involving rationalization of the tariff structure and a lowering of import duties and excise taxes with a view to discouraging evasion and limiting disincentive effects ; fiscal decentralization policies , including the devolution of tax collection to lower levels of government , and the introduction of value-added tax ( VAT ) and presumptive taxation in order to broaden the tax base - e.g . , in Ghana , Nigeria and Zambia . 
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
It is currently coordinating with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) in the design of profiles for poverty alleviation policies in four specific sectors in Lebanon - namely , health , education , employment and fiscal policy .  With regard to the theme of social integration , ESCWA has established the first Arab regional computer training centre for blind women / girls , located in Amman , Jordan .  
Its strategy for promoting universal access to basic social services is threefold : ( a ) direct support to service delivery ; ( b ) capacity - building and social mobilization ; and ( c ) advocacy .  UNICEF emphasizes the need to sustain investment in children in good times and in bad , and in times of fiscal restraint and economic liberalization .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
On that occasion the General Assembly responded to drastic changes that are rapidly transforming the role and scope of government in the economy and society : the globalization of the economy , democratization , environmental pressures , corruption , national fiscal and external deficits , pressures for social justice , the information revolution and the emergence of civil society as an alternative supplier of a range of public services .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
At the national level , sound fiscal and monetary policies that foster broadly based long-term growth should be strengthened and promoted .  
Concerning fiscal and monetary policy , a more sophisticated balance is required between achieving low inflation and encouraging growth of employment , between efficiency and equity and between economic development and environmental sustainability .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
The result was unrealistic national economic and fiscal policy-making , compounded by the poor administrative capacity of many governments to collect revenues .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
As argued in World Economic and Social Survey , 1997,3 Governments need to be sensitive to the fact that excessive enthusiasm for the quick reduction of budget deficits can have high economic and social cost and may not even be required for the fiscal probity that is indeed necessary in the medium run .  
There is some risk , however , that the substantial monetary tightening in 1997 ( the Bank of England raised interest rates from 6 per cent in May 1996 to 7.25 per cent in November 1997 ) , when coupled with continued fiscal stringency and a delayed feed-through of the effects of the sterling 's appreciation , might push the slowdown in growth too far .  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
There is a widespread need for more coherent and consistent policies , legal frameworks , fiscal and budgetary processes , institutional mechanisms , communication and education programmes , and better coordination between environmental and other ministries .  
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
Consumption will stay relatively weak , reflecting sluggish personal income growth and growing household debt , which increased from 65 per cent of personal disposable income in 1991 to almost 95 per cent in 1996 ; but the weakest component of demand will remain government spending owing to the continuation of fiscal austerity at all levels of government .  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Owing to the lack of developed capital markets and the non-availability of external borrowing , fiscal deficits are often financed wholly or partly by central banks , that is , through money creation , which increases the general price level , thus reducing the real value of the monetary unit .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
Measures should include the maintenance of sound fiscal and monetary policies , efficient and equitable taxation systems , low budget deficits and an efficient allocation of budgetary resources in which due priority is given to productive expenditure .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
The negotiation or formulation of adjustment programmes and programmes to reduce excessive budget deficit should take account of a special measure for improving the quality and structure of fiscal adjustment by reducing unproductive spending while ensuring an adequate basic level of investments in infrastructure .  
That measure was important for what could be called a sound macroeconomic policy ; however , coordination proper , in the sense that countries jointly established monetary or fiscal policies , was a thing of the past , since it had proved to be ineffective , as had been indicated in the World Economic and Social Study , 1995 .  
For some of its most active participants , this is an asset , since it will allow rapid development of international electronic trade flows with a minimum of legal , regulatory and fiscal obstacles .  
It also included an amount of $ 102,400 relating to an obligation raised for the purchase of a 4x4 medium heavy crane truck prior to the closing of the 30 June 1996 accounts which was inadvertently recorded in fiscal year 1997 .  
The problems of women in both urban and rural areas are such that women are not ready to become entrepreneurs because of insufficient start-up capital and managerial experience and an imperfect fiscal policy which does not suit everyone .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences105 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
With regard to budgetary allocations , the judiciary requested 750-million quetzales for fiscal year 1999 , based largely on the needs involved in the implementation of its modernization plan ; the executive branch assigned it 366.5-million quetzales in the regular budget .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
In preparing the forecast for regular budget cash balances at the end of 1999 , the major unknown variable is the amount to be received from the major contributor following that Member States anticipated national legislation for its fiscal year , which begins 1 October 1999 .  
In order to prepare for the high-level consideration of the topic of financing for development , it was important to focus on a number of key elements : States should begin with the mobilization of domestic resources , review the allocation of national expenditures and their fiscal priorities , look into the private sector and review their legal and administrative structures for rapid growth .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences119 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences131 or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
A combination of good weather , which led to significant improvements in agricultural output , and an improved policy environment as evidenced , inter alia , by low fiscal deficits and inflation has been responsible for increased economic growth in a number of countries .  
The agenda for the ninth meeting was based on the discussions during the eighth meeting of the Group of Experts and on important issues in international taxation in the context of prevailing international economic , fiscal and financial environment .  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
Secondly , debtor Governments and international institutions could agree on a multi-year fiscal scenario that addressed , inter alia , macroeconomic stability consistent with non-inflationary financing ; domestic rates of taxation consistent with rapid growth ; and adequate financing for core public goods , including education , public health and basic infrastructure .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
To achieve it , the Government decided to adopt a minimum programme of short-term actions which would make it possible to maintain the trend of a gradual increase in the tax burden in 1999 and to promote , together with the Commission , an extensive process of national consultation to define a long-term fiscal policy that would eliminate uncertainty by establishing clear , efficient and stable rules .  
Underscores that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow Up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and , therefore , stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies large government deficits to stimulate aggregate demand , or low interest rates to encourage domestic investment can no longer be used because of an overwhelming fear that such measures could lead to speculative capital flight and a run on the national currency .  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
These measures include the reconstruction of homes destroyed in the war , as well as the building of new homes and communal and social infrastructure ; they also include fiscal and other measures , and encouraging balanced economic growth and development in such areas .  11 .  In 1997 , the National Programme for the Development of the Islands , and the Islands Act were adopted , based on the principle of sustainable development .  
The Chinese trajectory , however , where these factors are absent , also points to the decisive role of State capacity in the virtuous growth path that accompanied gradual and uneven institutional reforms over a period of two decades ( as exemplified in the agricultural reforms , the open-door policy , the transitional dual-track regime in industry and the change in the fiscal system Chavance , forthcoming in 2000 ) .  
Urges Governments and international institutions to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies , the rule of law , sound judicial procedures , anti-corruption and bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that enhance efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
Underscores the fact that , as pointed out by the Commission to Follow up the Implementation of the Peace Agreements , key reforms remain outstanding , including the fiscal , judicial , military and electoral reforms , and therefore stresses the critical importance of continued compliance with the peace agreements in 2000 ;  
. . .  For the purpose of cooperation among States Parties to this Protocol , including , in particular , cooperation under article 9 of this Protocol , offences established in accordance with article 5 , paragraph 1 , of this Protocol shall not be considered fiscal offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic laws of the States Parties . 16 .  The title of article 18 bis should be amended to read as follows :  
In 1992 , the member countries signed the Maastricht Treaty , agreeing to eliminate over 280 physical , technical , and fiscal barriers to the creation of a single market , and moved one step closer to the final stage of currency union .  
At the domestic level , there is a particular responsibility to maintain a constant balance between fiscal austerity measures and the need to find the resources required to fund social policies , while not ignoring other issues , especially the lack of fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability , inadequate social policies and difficulties in broadening the participation of the various sectors of society .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
Despite the result of the referendum last May , it is of the utmost importance that the peace agreements be fully implemented , especially with regard to full respect for human rights , equal opportunities for the indigenous population , reform of the judicial system , fiscal and land reform , and reconciliation based on truth .  
A sustained and determined effort is necessary if the national peace agreements are to be fully implemented , particularly as concerns the fostering and protection of human rights , equal opportunities and judicial , fiscal and agrarian reform .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
These observations underscore the fact that the implementation of fiscal and economic policies by the Government and the use and distribution of national resources are carried out in such a way that most people are deprived of access to basic social and economic rights and opportunities , including access to education , health care , physical and mental integrity , water , food , etc .  
For the purpose of cooperation under this article , the offences covered by this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences 102 ] or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional limitations and the fundamental domestic law of the States Parties .  
In fiscal 1998 the Bank allocated to the social sector US $ 8 , 480-million out of total lending of US $ 28 , 594-million , including US $ 1.9-billion for health , population and nutrition ; US $ 665 million for basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation facilities ; and US $ 3.1-billion for education , placing greater emphasis on primary education for girls , the rural poor and linguistic minorities .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
The policies and actions of international financial institutions that advocated such liberalization and stressed structural adjustment and fiscal prudence when the crisis struck were viewed by many as exacerbating the negative social impact of the crisis .  
First , trade liberalization and the demands of global capital markets and financial institutions have to varying extents constrained the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy options for social purposes , including employment and equity objectives .  
The larger fiscal deficit partially offset the fall in private domestic demand , while monetary policy makers maintained an austere stance until midway through the year .
