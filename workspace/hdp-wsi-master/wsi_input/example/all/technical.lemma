The construction of Yanshuigou Tunnel started on September 15 last year .  Since Qiulitage is geologically characterized by brittle and weeping rocks and great susceptibility to cave-ins , the project managing department of the 15th Engineering Bureau of China Railway Construction Corp that was contracted to undertake construction adopted technical strategies such low-impact explosion , short length drilling and steel bolstering .  More than 26,000 cubic meters of rock were drilled and cleared before this long distance tunnel 3.9 meters wide at the bottom and 3.6 meters in height was finally completed .  
Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
During the " eighth five-year plan " period ( 1991 - 1995 ) , China 's opening up to the outside world is moving forward with unprecedented speed .  The national economy is broadening its participation wider range of international delegation and international exchange ; economic and technical cooperation and exchange between China and overseas has already infiltrated into every aspect of China 's economic life .  A " wide open " environment has begun to take shape in the whole country .  
For a future period of time , China will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in new agricultural technology , comprehensive development of land resources , and such basic industries and pillar industries as water conservation , energy , transportation , important raw materials , machinery and electronics , mining , etc . and will encourage foreign businessmen to employ new high level technology to participate in the technical transformation of China 's enterprises  
A large number of technical and new type managerial and administrative talent was trained , the transformation of the enterprise 's operational mechanism and the reorganization of assets were accelerated and a lot of modern famous brands such as Shanghai Bell , Shanghai Volkswagen , Konka , TCL , etc . were formed . 
Their advanced apparatus and equipment , highly level scientific and technical staff and comprehensive dominance in scientific research have made important contributions to the promotion of construction of national key projects and the development of academic disciplines .  
This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
To address the objective reality of China 's scientific and technical journals , the scientific funding magazine department of the National Commission for Natural Sciences Funding , in April 1999 organized and convened an international symposium on " Raising the Overall Quality of China 's Scientific and Technical Periodicals " .  The scientists and personages from publishing circles who participated in the symposium concluded for the most part that in the future , the development of China 's scientific and technical magazines most certainly must follow " planned birth , " with the focus on raising quality .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
and put the ideological and political education in the primary position of quality education .  It is imperative to promote the integration of the students ' moral , intellectual , physical , aesthetic , and labor technical education with social practice ;  
the people of the whole country have expressed an ardent wish to build a prosperous nation through science and education and a strong country through knowledge ; the whole country 's industrial and agricultural structures have been undergoing major readjustment ; the enterprises have been engaged in technical innovation ;  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
However , entry into the international market was not something that could be accomplished in one move .  To reach the technical standards for product quality in various countries , China 's household electrical appliance enterprises persisted in producing high-quality products in compliance with internationalized standards to obtain international certification under the system of product quality assurance by numerous exporting countries , thus completing the first step they must take in entering the international market , securing the " pass " to the international market , and opening up an international passageway .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
To make static targets moveable , the task force engaged in tackling major technical hurdles worked without a letup for several months , made do with whatever was available , and thus succeeded in developing movable false tanks , false armored cars , and other false targets .  
During the Kosovo war , in view of NATO 's technical superiority in space and aerial reconnaisance , the Yugoslav People 's Army used the strategy of concealing the genuine and displaying the false and breaking up the whole into parts ; they hid their tanks in the woods and set up dummy targets all over the place and also arranged heat and electromagnetic sources around them , to lure and deceive the enemy reconnaisance system into being fooled . 
Just before the battle the training emphasized technical and tactical training for individual soldiers and small sections , and importance was also attached to coordination between different branches and joint training of major units ; at the same time the topography and weather conditions of the training areas were as far as possible similar to those of the target area .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
Leaders at all levels should study hard more new and high-tech knowledge to improve their scientific and technical qualifications , should conduct deep and satisfactory investigation and studies and modestly listen to opinions from experts and personnel involved in science and technology .  Leaders at all levels should always be in a clear-minded state , always direct the army in the right direction of the troop training and carry out the training project in a deep and consistent manner .  
As of date , the unit has established medical , transportation , ordnance , maintenance , telecommunications , and other groups to engage in supporting campaigns and studying methods of operations .  It has exerted great efforts to tackle the most difficult scientific and technical problems and decided on more than 10 topics of study .  The 30-plus theses it published have attracted the attention of academic departments and higher-level administrative departments .  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
However , since the goals were not clear and the standards were not clear , the understanding of " computerization and informationization " led to an emphasis on hardware , while taking software lightly ; an emphasis on single units , while taking networking lightly ; and an emphasis on development and redundant construction projects .  Shortcomings occurred where systems construction was not complete ; technical systems were not compatible ; and non unified standards increased daily .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
We should strengthen the collection and accumulation of all kinds of operational data , not only collecting complete information on our side , but even more clarifying of detailed reference data and indicators on our operational opponent , particularly on the foremost opponent 's technical equipment , operational theory , battlefield geographical circumstance , and important operational targets .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
and should conduct emergency repair-oriented professional or technical training and comprehensive simulated training so as to strengthen our capability of handling an emergency situation or conducting an emergency repair under the complex , difficult , or dangerous conditions during a war and ensure that certain economic targets , which are damaged to a certain extent , will be quickly repaired and restored to normal operation in a timely fashion , thus reducing damages and avoiding further damages .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
After a certain number of years ' efforts , the army 's technical cadres with specialties of both military and civilian applicability will be cultivated mainly through regular higher education , some outstanding regular college graduates will fill the commander 's position of the army 's grass-roots units , and around 40 percent of the army 's annual cadre replenishment will be those trained through regular higher education .  
At 10:20 , the command center received from higher levels " an order of recruiting specialized technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment to support the front " .  It immediately started the plan for recruiting technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment from the national defense mobilization database and transmitted the plan to the various command sub-centers for scientific and technological mobilization .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
Today , all the members of the brigade have had an intimate knowledge of the technical and tactical functions of all authorized main-battle weapons ; can use more than three telecommunications tools , can drive all tracked and wheeled vehicles , and can fire all light and heavy firearms in life-ammunition practices ; and have turned themselves into officers and men of the new type who " can drive when mounting a vehicle , and can fire when mounting an antiaircraft gun " .  
Support for projects of basic research , common industrial technology , key technology , and high technology has been strengthened and initial results for conducting technical innovation and industrializing scientific and technological achievements have been obtained .  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
The regulations fullyreflect the great importance that the CMC and headquarters have attached to the development of military colleges , and their concern and care for their teaching staff .  The regulations certainly will play a positive part in enabling the armed forces to bring in outstanding personnel , retaining the mainstay teachers , stabilizing their ranks , and improving the system of establishing specialized and technical positions , and strengthening college construction in all respects .  
From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
In order to increase their large-scale airdropping and fighting capability and their capability to make surprise attacks on the ground with motor-driven firepower , they have made a series of bold attempts in airdropping heavy equipment .  They have succeeded in several dozen experiments in airdropping command cars , large trucks , fuel tankers , and cannons , thus properly solving crucial technical problems in loading , tying down , dropping , releasing , buffering and preventing toppling over upon landing , of large equipment .  
With the rapid development in the equipment and technical level of the Chinese armored unit , the new generation of the officers and men of the " heroic " tank unit are aiming for the frontier of the world 's high technology .  They , guided by actual combat requirements and relying on existing equipment potentials , have successfully revamped the Chinese army 's first digital tank .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
In accordance with the requirements laid down in its five-year program , the division 's party committee has divided fighting capacity building into four major aspects , namely , political work , military work , logistical support , and equipment and technical support ; has tackled bottlenecks which prevent new-type equipment from turning into all-round fighting capacity by focusing on key and thorny issues ; and has laid a solid foundation step by step .  
Since our army 's network and website building is still at such a primary stage as network personnel handling military issues and the majority of our army 's qualified personnel are still of technical support in nature and have yet to extensively develop or apply the existing hardware or software system in terms of functions and in light of operational decision , command , and tactic , faced with the fast advent of information warfare and network warfare , our army should make further efforts to carry out follow-up research ; explore countermeasures ; 
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
During Comrade Wei Jianxing 's visit to Germany , Moldova , Finland , and the State of Mongolia , in addition to meeting with their presidents , prime ministers and parliamentary speakers , he also held talks and had meetings with major opposition party leaders , exchanged views with them on bilateral relations and major international issues of common concern , and examined the questions of technical innovations and building the legal system , which exerted a very good influence .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
In light of the operational characteristics of missile vessels and the technical and tactical levels of their attacks , it intensified training in such difficult areas as twin planes ' minimum altitude attacks and interception .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
Therefore , a large portion of the US ' scientific research capability is focused in private departments , university / technical schools , and scientific research centers relying on Department of Defense funds .  They have strong executive mechanisms which organize and maintain a tight relationship between the " procurer " and research center .  
A destroyer squadron of the East China Sea Fleet has concentrated their efforts on solving problems at the " bottleneck " that restricts the increase of its combat capacity , carried out technical innovation and research , and successfully developed an automatic missile checking device , a missile loader checking device , and a missile full start checking system .  This has turned something sophisticated , unwieldy and backward into something simple , ingenious and advanced and has greatly increased the quick response capacity of the squadron .  
To increase the quick response capacity and the capacity to gain the initiative by striking first by the destroyers , the technical personnel of the squadron have boldly reformed the traditional methods for checking missiles before they are launched .  They have invented a way to check missiles quickly and to optimize the checking procedures without changing the technical performance of missiles .  This has greatly increased the response capacity of the system of multi-series vessel missiles and has ensured " launching missiles before the enemy . "  
We will selectively support a group of backbone enterprises in the energy , metallurgy , chemical , light , textile , machinery , automobile , building materials , and construction industries in their efforts to carry out technical transformation and improve the standards of their technology and equipment while working around the goals of increasing product varieties , improving quality , conserving energy , preventing and controlling pollution , expanding exports , and improving labor productivity .  
It is understood that the development of this large piece of training equipment , which can conduct total-system simulation of real equipment , was tackled as an assault mission and completed in three months by a " shock brigade " made up of 29 experts at the college .  It was over seven times more efficient than conventional development , providing strong technical support for the fast generation of combat capability from new equipment .  
Meanwhile , it has also trained a corps of cross-century technical researchers with quite high academic achievements , having laid solid grounds for China 's strategy of revitalizing the nation through science and education and our sustained development strategy , to speed up our establishment of a national innovation system .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
According to the technical norms of market regulatory systems that stock markets have applied to trace irregular trading activities , the China Security Regulatory Commission conducted quantitative analyses in a specific period of time and found that this corporation had engaged in such irregular business more than 10,000 times .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
The leading body invited military technology experts to teach its members the military space technology , guided missile precision control and guide , automatic commanding technology , and other frontier military knowledge of the contemporary world .  Members of the leading body went deep into the training fields and launching pads to carry out technical practices and scientific and technological research , and to guide troops in completing a number of projects on scientific and technical drills .  
This university regarded this project as its key scientific research task , put in several hundred-thousand yuan to carry out research and development , and directly applied several major scientific research findings to transforming the existing weapons .  Through nearly two years of painstaking efforts to do research and to tackle problems , finally , this university successfully fulfilled the artillery digital transformation task , thus effectively enhancing the tactical and technical performances of towed artillery .  
The state is obliged to adopt effective steps to guarantee the realization of these rights , for example , providing technical and vocational guidance and training , ensuring men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work , guarantee industrial safety and public sanitation in the working environment , ensuring that people in the same trades enjoy equal chances for promotion and such promotion will only be determined by seniority and ability , and will not be affected by any other factors .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
and have a full range of technical means for law-enforcement .  Sixth , we must revise and perfect relevant laws and regulations , build a stronger law-enforcement contingent , and improve the level of law-enforcement .  A task of top priority is to conscientiously tackle the outstanding problem that the law is neither fully observed nor enforced .  
Following several days ' hard work , a young military representative finally fulfilled his task of providing technical support .  However , when he returned to the Military Representative Office the following day feeling he was relieved of a heavy load , he was unexpected criticized .  He wept and felt he was wronged .  
The paper 's technical facilities have developed from the mimeographs , planographic printing and rotary letterpress printing of that time to the advanced laser photocomposition systems and satellite transmission systems of today .  Not only can they now print in color , they can receive high quality prints directly from that same day 's People 's Daily and Cankao Xiaoxi .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
Since the implementation of the new system governing noncommissioned officers over a year ago , noncommissioned officers have been playing a very prominent role at the basic-level units .  They have become backbone forces in military units ' combat training , education , and study of specialized technical skills , playing a decisive role in military units ' basic and long-range developments .  
He stated that the science and technology hall is an important place for people to acquire scientific and technical knowledge , understand science and technology , and exchange S &amp; T knowledge and results , as well as being a base for primary and middle-school students to engage in quality education , so we should make full use of existing facilities , enhancing the content of the exhibits and also doing a good job of making the briefings and lectures lively and explaining difficult concepts in simple terms .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
We will investigate and deal with the evasion of public bidding in the course of launching construction projects , fraud during the bidding process , transfer of contracts , illegal subcontracting , contracting for projects without proper documents or for projects that exceed official limits , and activities that violate legally stipulated construction procedures , that do not enforce mandatory technical standards , that involve shoddy work and the use of inferior materials , and that pass substandard buildings off as buildings of good quality .  
In the boundless vast sea of clouds and the vast sky filled with gun smoke , Fu Shaoyin and the young fellows of the " blue army " detachment placed the " red army " in a difficult position time and again with their nimble and skillful technical tactics as well as rapid , cunning , and stubborn striking power .  
The " operational manual for new-type aircraft and fighters " compiled by reading several hundreds of new aircraft materials , studying and analyzing over a-hundred pieces of cabin equipment and aerial test flight verifications , and with the efforts of Li Keqiang and pilots of the whole regiment was published , thus providing effective technical support for our military training for refitting new-type fighters .  Following that , six volumes of " collections of theses on study of new-type aircraft tactical and combat methods " were compiled and published .  
Liu Huadi : In the 50 years since its peaceful liberation , Tibet has witnessed a fast development in its education undertakings .  It now has a fairly complete modern educational system encompassing primary education , adult education , vocational and technical education and special education from primary school to university level .  
At the same time , in order to cope with sudden situations , organize mobile support forces which have advanced support methods and implement pre-support for the various support zones , using an organic combination of basic support forces and mobile support forces to seek stable , rapid , and effective technical support .  
What stable supply and maintenance support links refers to is the integrated use of various support means , with pre-combat support deployment serving as the base , to form a multidimensional logistical support network for the entire in-depth joint combat battlefield , including supply and support links in which the replenishment of ammunition is a key point , technical support links in which the maintenance of new and high-tech equipment is a key point , and knowledge support links in which troops with special skills are the key points .  
It is not hard to discover that the idea running through these specific items is that , in organizing logistical support for joint combat , information sharing is the foundation , the optimal deployment of support resources is the goal , and technical cooperation is the key .  
Right now , a considerable number of domestic enterprises are relatively low in standard .  Some of our enterprises carry out extensive management , while others are backward in technology and equipment .  Still others are weak in carrying out technical innovations .  
After the invasion of terrorists into southern Kyrgyzstan last year , it was a member of the " Shanghai Five " that first provided political , military and technical assistance to the country .  The collective security system of the Commonwealth of Independent States also played a positive part .  At present , the armed forces of Kyrgyzstan are bracing themselves for possible assaults from international terrorist forces .  
The ministers unanimously held that it is necessary to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation , push forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation within APEC , and step up economic and technical cooperation in order to meet challenges of the new century with practical action .  
The meeting stressed the importance of economic and technical cooperation in promoting sustained and sound economic development in the Asia-Pacific region and was determined to work hard to narrow the gap among members so as to achieve common prosperity .  
To this end , while making efforts to build the command , operation , and technical contingents and in connection with its efforts to tackle key scientific and technological problems in equipment development and training reform , it actively encouraged cadres having development potentials to attend academic symposiums and research results reviewing conferences sponsored by the superior organs , research units , and colleges and schools in an effort to broaden their vision and enable them to have unclogged access to information .  
During the entire course - - from testing , launching , organizing , and directing to technical support - - participants served both as instructors and students and tackled one key problem after another .  They not only successfully accomplished the live ammunition launching mission but also blazed a new trail for teaching special theories in operating new equipment and training .  In addition , it has tempered the backbone contingent .  
Then , aside from assigning the personnel with doctorate or master 's degrees to units with modern equipment and positions that require scientific and technical expertise , the region also gave them important military assignments to accomplish , or assigned them to oversee projects of tackling difficult operational and training problems .  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
The university has also trained a large number of professional and technical cadres , specialists , scholars , and professors , who have made remarkable contributions in their own posts to the cause of building socialism and the maintaining of the unification of the motherland and the unity of various nationalities and played an extremely important role in the economic and social development of areas inhabited by ethnic groups .  
Female managers , factory directors , and entrepreneurs have mounted the economic stage one after another where they put their talents to good use .  By late 2000 , female professional and technical personnel totaled 11,708,000 , 40.6 percent of all professional and technical personnel .  Among them , 436,000 held senior positions and 3,263,000 held mid-level positions .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
In view of the different features of party members at different levels and ranks , a certain frigate unit under the Navy and a certain base under the 2d Artillery Corps have worked out , according to the specific duties and responsibilities at different work posts , concrete advanced state-maintaining guidelines respectively for party-member leading cadres , party-member cadres working under leading organs , party-member cadres involved in specialized or technical fields , party-member cadres at the grass-roots level , party members among cadets and compulsory servicemen , as well as party-member staff .  
With the coming of the new century , we ardently wish that Guangzhou and Tibet will walk to hand in hand even more closely , further strengthen and deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the economic , technical , scientific , educational , cultural , travel , and other areas , that they will continually create new forms of cooperation , expand the areas of cooperation , mutually use their strong points to compensate for weaknesses , and move forward shoulder to shoulder .  
Meanwhile , the 10th Five-Year Plan for Sci-Tech Development has clearly defined the following concrete goals for China 's sci-tech development : First , we should greatly improve our industrial level and international competitiveness .  We should ensure that the technical level of the major domains of our agricultural , industrial , and service sectors would be improved to the same level as enjoyed by advanced countries in the mid-1990s .  
In light of this situation , the office has pooled its backbone technical personnel .  After more than one year of hard work to overcome key problems , they have developed a new type of missile for military training .  Compared with regular missiles , these missiles for military training purpose are low in manufacturing cost .  They can be used several thousand times .

This is because of the short duration and more complex nature of the practical tests involved and hence it is impossible to fully assess the candidates ' performance in the application of technical skills in one single practical examination .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .

World Standards Day is celebrated on October 14 every year by members of major organisations involved in international standards , namely the International Organisation for Standardisation ( ISO ) and the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) , as a means of paying tribute to the collaborative efforts of the thousands of experts worldwide who develop the voluntary technical agreements that are published as international standards .  
For applications that have previous approvals from the Board but have been revoked because of non-compliance of planning conditions , planning permission will only be granted if the applicants have included in the submissions technical assessments or proposals to demonstrate that the proposed uses will not generate adverse drainage , environmental and traffic impacts on the surrounding areas , and the assessments are acceptable to concerned departments .  
As for the construction and engineering contracts , a major reason for single tendering was to avoid technical problems or contractual disputes that might arise from the employment of different contractors on the works .  Another main reason was that the works required were of extreme urgency : for example , the works had to be completed before the typhoon or rain season ; open tendering in these circumstances would delay the works and prejudice public or security interests .  
The course is set up in the " Slope Safety Island " of the Hong Kong Slope Safety Website ( http : / / hkss.ced.gov.hk ) .  The beginner course contains interactive multimedia functions and games on how to maintain man-made slopes and retaining walls .

The alert will include a summary of the incident , relevant preventive and remedial measures , as well as technical recommendations .  The aim is to help the public understand the development and impact of the incident so that effective preventive and remedial actions can be taken .  
Members also observed that the technical measures introduced to improve the Currency Board system in 1998 ( including the introduction of the discount window and a substantial increase in the size of the Monetary Base ) had , through reducing the sensitivity of interest rates to speculative attacks , probably reduced the amount by which GDP and prices would decline following a speculative attack .  They noted , however , that there was , for the time being , insufficient empirical data for this to be clearly shown .  
Through the hard working of its well organized staff , RSEA has developed from a modest beginning handling simple manpower jobs into the present-day broad scope technical construction operation ; from using a few , crude machines to 4 , 740 pieces of modern equipment . RSEA has been rendering its services both on the domes tic services and in several foreign countries .  
During his three-day visit , President Yen and King Khaled held six talks . The Republic of China chief of state also visited various important cultural and economic establishments . Through the arrangements of the reception unit , President Yen received representatives of his country 's technical groups and overseas Chinese in Saudi Arabia . He talked with them and expressed his commendation for their contributions to international friendship and good will .  
It stressed that both leaders were gratified by the continuous development in political , economic and technical relations between their countries . They shared identical ideals and aspirations , the communique stated , believing as they did that the foundation of traditional friendship , based on high moral principles and fraternal solidarity , was both firm and enduring . The king and the president reaffirmed the common cause of their countries and peoples in upholding peace , freedom and human rights and opposing all forms of aggression , oppression and prejudice .  
A joint venture of six private chemical firms , the plant was completed in May 1973 , with a total capitalization of NT $ 320 million ( US $ 8 million ) . Equipped with ultramodern machinery , it was designed to produce Vinyl Chloride Monomer ( VCM ) for use by the local plastics industry . Because of climate and technical problems , however , the machinery did not work satisfactorily , and by 1975 , operations were halted except for four or five months a year .  
At present , 32 leading educational establishments , including four universities ( National Taiwan University , National Normal University , Center for Public and Business Administration Education of the National Chengchi University and the downtown headquarters of the Tamkang College of Arts and Sciences ) , two technical academies , eight senior commercial high schools , seven junior high schools and 11 elementary schools are located in the district .  
His strong use of color and lack of technical skill give Hung 's works a primitive and traditional flavor . The old man 's eccentric behavior and distaste for worldly wealth are a secondary attraction for visitors .  
Market trends in Europe and the U . S . this year show that older people are buying ceramic dolls to pass on to the younger generation . International demand for gift items , steadily increasing apace of world population growth and improved living standards , has led to the development of worldwide gift industries . Advanced nations often phase out their production of small gifts in favor of larger , technical and high profit items .  
Sufficient advances in these industries predicate the production of a high quality doll . Ts'ui Chung , advisor to the Taiwan Toy Manufacturers Association , points out that Taiwan 's supporting industries , benefited by technical experience accumulated over the past thirty years , are unmatched by those of any other advancing nation . Taiwan 's chief competitor in the toy line is Hong Kong .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Ancient China was known as " the land of impeccable attire , " and its culture was always closely tied to the high technical level of its textile crafts . Its silk fabrics , for instance , were treasured commodities among people in other countries , and the Silk Road became a symbol of cultural interchange between East and West . At home its precious textiles spurred the development of the art of embroidery .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
Today seven teams with 29 members are active in 12 farming areas . Their agenda includes experimental cultivation of crops such as maize , paddy rice and sorghum ; soil and weather surveys to establish the suitability of crops ; hydrological and topographical surveys to establish data for irrigation and drainage projects ; and social surveys to learn more about the farming population 's willingness to work and their technical level .  
In other words , the elderly lack a sense of security about the future and do n't want to wait idly for death , so they need another stage on which to play out the remainder of their lives . " Hsieh Tseng Fang-lan believes services of this kind have a promising future , and the response from outside has been most gratifying . The manpower bank has yet to be officially registered but enquiries are pouring in , with a need for services ranging from technical advisers for refrigeration and air-conditioning to electricity meter readers .  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
The complexity of the engineering for Three Gorges has enabled the two sides to produce vast amounts of technical material on flood prevention , electrical power generation , transport , economic efficiency , water supply , siltation , and similar subjects . There are even cases of mainland engineers being labelled as " rightist " and having their whole families dragged down with them just because they opposed the project .  
" It 's a very technical issue , " explains jade expert Na Chi-liang . The objects of art from every era have their own special characteristics . The gods and animal face patterns of Liangzhu art is similar to the Taotie , a legendary beast often seen in statues of the Shang and Chou dynasties . But upon a more precise comparison , the beast faces of Liangzhu works appear more rustic and simple ; they purvey a feeling of fierceness .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
There are no breakdowns to show the numbers going for language study as opposed to an undergraduate , master 's or doctoral degree , but Yuan has observed that most are going to enroll in undergraduate programs . In particular , many students at technical junior colleges go to Australia for a university degree , and in deciding to go they usually consider the question of immigration . This may happen as well in other major targets for Taiwanese emigration , such as New Zealand and Canada .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
Western imperialism left a legacy of imbalance in the use of the world 's resources . Poorer nations , pressed by rapid population growth and the desire to develop , and lacking sufficient management or technical skills , usually rejected calls from the wealthy countries to put the environment first .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
Stanley Yen complained that once the tourism industry finally got a school established to train professional chefs , the structure of Taiwan 's tertiary education system changed and many technical junior colleges were redesignated as four-year colleges . As a result , the most talented graduates of the cooking school ended up teaching rather than working in food services , and Taiwan lost its opportunity to produce international-caliber chefs .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
The purpose of the WHO is defined as helping people in the entire world to enjoy the highest possible standard of health . Its main responsibilities are to offer leadership and coordination on matters related to international health , to provide technical assistance , and to promote measures to prevent epidemics , regional diseases , and other illnesses . In addition , the environment , women 's issues , food safety , and global pharmaceuticals standards also fall within the purview of the WHO .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
With falling student numbers and faced with apparent apathy , technical and vocational colleges have been forced to adjust their developmental goals in order to survive , and this has thrown the entire system into crisis .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy . At a time when standard universities and colleges seem unsure of their own development and are establishing an increasing number of money-making , functional departments , they have begun to impinge on a market formerly considered the preserve of vocational schools . Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
Some people say straight out that the comprehensive high school can only attract students of middling ability . Requiring these students to study with a dual orientation and to " explore " multiple areas causes them to fall even further behind their senior high school counterparts in the general curriculum . Added to this , they are not as good as vocational high school students in technical subjects-so they end up " losing out at both ends . "  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
After the talks , they attended a signing ceremony of the summary for the fourth session of the mixed committee of economy , trade , and technology between the governments of China and the Sudan , agreement for economic and technical cooperation , agreement for encouraging and mutual protection of investment , and other agreements

Kemp and China 's Minister of Education Chen Zhili renewed earlier today a memorandum of understanding on educational and training cooperation , in which senior education , professional and technical education , far distance education are decided as priority fields for bilateral cooperation  
qian noted that since the two countries set up diplomatic relations some 20 years ago , the bilateral relations have enjoyed smooth development and that the economic and technical co operation have been fruitful  
A steering committee has been established at the Secretariat level to plan and coordinate all technical , administrative , logistical and financial aspects of the Conference , which includes representatives of all relevant offices of the Secretariat ;  
To improve this coordination at a technical level , some countries have established joint task forces of senior officials of these ministries and agencies to undertake key economic projections of the main macroeconomic variables .  
For the purposes of advisory services and technical assistance , the term " national institution " is interpreted flexibly to mean any body which is established by a Government to play a central role in the domestic human rights situation .  
The team was formed into technical working groups covering 10 major economic and social sectors and 10 intersectoral issues , and prepared a comprehensive draft Action Plan for Immediate Rehabilitation based on existing knowledge of the situation .  
ILO continued to provide technical advisory service to a number of OAU-sponsored regional and subregional institutions concerned with vocational rehabilitation and training , occupational safety and health , and migration and social security .  
The ISpMA concept can be successfully implemented by moving forward in stages and establishing a sound political , legal and technical basis for the implementation of subsequent steps .  
The Croatian Government and the public and private sector were widely represented and exchanged views with most major international financial and technical assistance bodies and financial experts from all parts of the world .  
As the century draws to a close , the world is experiencing profound changes in the ideological , political , economic , social , scientific and technical spheres .  
That is why we ask for the unfailing support and backing of the international community , which , we feel , should in the short - , medium - and long-term involve substantial , increased and strengthened technical and financial cooperation . 
The Commission stressed that the use of local logistical and technical aerial and other support would be dependent upon the prevailing situation of confidence and availability of adequate assets .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and the specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
It is , therefore , of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping .

It is , therefore , fundamental that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation are well focused and that means for coordinating such activities are studied in order to avoid overlapping actions .  
The Bank 's policy in regard to lending outside the European Union has been based on detailed economic and technical analysis of alternative solutions and the optimum size and timing of project implementation , together with their environmental impact .  
Indeed , after a long period of conservative and incremental technical change , alternative process routes for mineral production are being developed and these are emerging as economically more efficient as well as environmentally less hazardous .  
In this process , it was crucial to go beyond the limits of a technical exercise and to develop a process marked by shared ethical values where individual goals must be reconciled with global solidarity .  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
An interim multilateral fund was created to assist developing countries meet their incremental costs ( mainly technical and financial ) resulting from the adoption of substitute technologies to help them comply with the Protocol 's phaseout provisions .  
In this latter case , strategies are defined in practical terms , and development initiatives ( investment , technical assistance ) are planned on a flexible , rolling basis instead of making use of a lengthy process of complex multiyear development planning .  
They are increasingly contributing also by encouraging employees to volunteer and by providing , free of charge , their organizational talents , technical skills and physical facilities for raising funds and delivering services .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction management and supervisory tasks .  
The Commission considers it imperative that the export of radioactive wastes be inadmissible to countries that do not have the technical , economic , legal and administrative resources for environmentally safe and sound management of radioactive wastes .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
It is estimated that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
The veracity of the information is enhanced to the extent that structured technical and operational relationships are working in close , and timely , collaboration at the national , regional , and international levels ;  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
It is crucial that the current complementary efforts by national and international organizations involved in mineclearing , mine awareness and education , technical assistance and assistance to the victims of mines be strengthened and accelerated ;  
MEXICO Request : In late May 1994 , the Government requested technical assistance to national observers for the elections scheduled for 21 August 1994 and , prior to the elections , the preparation of an analytical report on the Mexican electoral system .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
A complete understanding of Iraq 's technical capabilities , manufacturing equipment , precursor suppliers and past chemical weapon production activities are essential if the Commission is to be confident that it is monitoring from a solid base .  
It coordinated and monitored humanitarian assistance operations , provided technical assistance to and verified the entire electoral process , culminating in the holding of free and fair elections on 27 to 29 October 1994 .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
It is thus an important duty of the international community to promote democracy among and within States by helping them to build a democratic system ; by providing them with logistical and technical support for the organization of free elections ; by promoting the creation of a public sector to guarantee the proper management of State affairs ; and by providing the various sectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate the bases of democracy .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Jamaica 's national youth policy was therefore designed to redress all these deficiencies , but first of all to bring an integrated approach to the activities of youth organizations nation wide and to equip all youth with the necessary academic , technical and life-coping skills to foster their personal development .  
The influx of young people into the labour market has led to the emergence of acute social problems ; rapid advances in many scientific and technical areas have posed new challenges that must be faced by the education and training systems if youth unemployment is to be addressed properly and prevented from giving rise to many social ills , such as marginalization , poverty and delinquency .  
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
This is linked primarily to the absence of a clear international treaty and legal bases , procedures and documents regulating the actions and powers of the relevant international institutions and also national organizations , for securing a timely and effective reaction to emergency situations of a natural and technical origin .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
The Secretary-General 's report is a technical compilation of the answers received from some States , without its own input and without the views of so many competent international organizations that are daily preoccupied with current and future developments in the Balkans .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at providing the United Nations system , on a stand-by basis , with specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation , and , in this regard , notes with satisfaction the establishment , in particular in developing countries , of national volunteer corps ;  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Deeply concerned about the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to education , training and literacy programmes ,  
Japan appreciated the role played by the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in providing advisory services and technical and financial assistance at the request of Governments and the role played by regional human rights machinery in supporting human rights activities and programmes .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
Governments , with the participation of the private sector , non-governmental organizations , local community groups , indigenous people , women , local government units and the public at large , should act to maintain and expand the existing vegetative cover wherever ecologically , socially and economically feasible , through technical cooperation and other forms of support .  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
UNCTAD , when carrying out technical cooperation , should exploit its comparative advantages , ensure complementarity with the related work of other international organizations , intervene on strategic and catalytic grounds and allow for the differentiated needs of developing countries with a particular focus on the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , in accordance with the Cartegena Commitment .  
For that purpose , the Board requested the secretariat to prepare an annual report on selected technical cooperation topics , supported by comprehensive factual information on individual projects as well as on the programme as a whole ;  
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
An effective advisory service and technical assistance programme was a major concern of all those who took part in the World Conference on Human Rights , Governments , United Nations agencies and programmes , regional and national institutions and non-governmental organizations alike , and the Vienna Declaration makes such a programme one of the principal means for achieving its objectives and those of the Programme of Action .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
In 1993 , UNFPA organized a thematic evaluation of family planning services in eight countries to assess the quality of such services along six dimensions : choice of methods ; technical competence of service providers ; level of information and counselling available to clients ; nature of interpersonal relations between service providers and clients ; the presence of mechanisms within the programme to promote continued contraceptive use ; and the appropriateness and acceptability of services .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Welcoming the increased role undertaken by the United Nations system to support activities in economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and stressing the importance of continuing to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to foster international cooperation in order to address fully the wide range of issues pertaining to development and the growth of developing countries ,  
In particular , the global POPIN Coordinating Unit and the regional Population Information Networks are working towards harnessing the tremendous potential of print , audiovisual and electronic media , including databases and networks , to disseminate technical information and to promote and strengthen understanding of relationships between population , consumption , production and sustainable development .  
At the international level priority should be given to the development of a holistic and integrated framework to put in place social and economic conditions which will facilitate optimum matching of land resources with needs , in terms of production , sustainability , and conservation of biodiversity , together with the necessary technical and infrastructural support , which can be applied in any country with appropriate modifications , according to local needs and conditions .  Proposal 2 .  
The United Republic of Tanzania , which in the late 1970s and early 1980s implemented a successful technical project to stop overgrazing-induced land degradation by destocking some 120,000 head of cattle in the Kondoa district of central Tanzania , is now working on the socio-economic aspect , seeking ways to manage growing population pressure and reintroduce livestock into the farming systems of the under-utilized , formerly eroded area .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
The Commission supports international and regional networks on in situ conservation areas ; ex situ base collection under the auspices of FAO ; the organization of a fourth international technical conference on the conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources ; and the establishment of the new global information systems for plant genetic resources and seed exchange based on the ongoing Seed Information System .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
The support units seem widespread - they are responsible for developing local guidelines for national execution , training line ministries on national execution procedures , preparing the required national execution reports , facilitating contractual arrangements with cooperating and implementation agencies and generally providing support to the technical ministries hosting nationally executed programmes .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such technical advisory panel ( s ) as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Recommends for this purpose that a second technical meeting on the planning of the Decade be convened immediately prior to the thirteenth session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations , to be supported from within existing budgetary resources , and urges Governments , United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and , in particular , indigenous people 's organizations to participate actively in that meeting , in accordance with agreed procedures ;  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , in countries affected by the illicit drug problem , that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Several participants called for an increased role for UNEP 's regional offices on trade-environment issues , for greater emphasis on raising environmental understanding , awareness-building and education , and for technical analysis in such areas as prior informed consent , environmental reviews of trade policy , environmental dispute avoidance , analysis of intellectual property rights in technology transfer and international cooperation .  
If the distribution of women 's employment is considered by seven major occupation groups - professional and technical , administrative and managerial , clerical , sales , services , agriculture , and production - it can be noted that women are concentrated in clerical , services and professional and technical occupations . 
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
With rising incomes the poor should be able to afford rudimentary but satisfactory sanitation facilities with some technical advice on sewage disposal facilities from the Government , but it will remain the responsibility of the Government to provide basic health care and safe drinking water facilities to the poor wherever they are located .  
While he respected the Committee on Contributions as an independent , technical body in its sphere of competence , he noted that , because of the vague nature of the mandate given to it by the General Assembly , it had been unable to adopt a balanced political decision on the scale of assessments , as a result of which the matter had been left to the Fifth Committee .  
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
Deeply concerned by the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to training and literacy programmes ,  
It was appreciated that the report of the Secretary-General on sustainable mountain development ( E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 5 ) , in addition to technical aspects , also covered the social , economic and cultural aspects of human development in mountain areas .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
The system must therefore be reviewed and updated so that resolutions are of the highest technical quality , carry proper moral weight and have the proper deterrent effect , are carried out with the swiftness required in order to protect and compensate the victims and are respected and implemented promptly by the relevant bodies .  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In response , the Special Unit has prepared a report which contains a number of recommendations designed to promote and implement a more strategic approach to technical cooperation among developing countries in an effort to make it a dynamic instrument in support of development in the context of the changing realities of multilateral development cooperation .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
Within the framework of existing guidelines , individual technical cooperation activities under the regular programme are determined by the nature of requests received from developing countries , the recommendations of intergovernmental legislative and expert bodies , and the approved work programmes .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
The programme comprises four interrelated and mutually supportive functions : ( a ) developing statistical concepts and methods for use by Member States ; ( b ) collecting , processing and disseminating integrated statistics ; ( c ) promoting the coordination of international statistical activities ; and ( d ) supporting technical cooperation in statistics and statistical data processing , including informatics .  
The activities to be carried out in the biennium 1996-1997 under the three subprogrammes of programme 12 of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised ( A / 47 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , will emphasize assistance to developing countries in improving their development planning systems and policies in support of national development through provision of advisory services to Governments upon their request and substantive and operational support to technical cooperation projects .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
Welcomes the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ;  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Collection and evaluation of information for the development and maintenance of performance indicators ; basic data for least developed countries ; studies , analytical papers and issues notes for technical meetings , including round tables , consultative groups and the Committee on Development Planning , as well as joint publications with regional commissions and other organizations .  
( i ) Statistical profiles by subregion ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) regional compendium of environmental statistics ; ( iii ) statistical charts on thematic topics ( 2 ) ; and ( iv ) technical publications on socio-economic and environment statistics ( 2 ) ; 
Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
A coherent national policy would enhance the managerial capability on economic and technical cooperation among developing countries within government and could enable developing countries to take maximum advantage of their participation in cooperation activities and speed up the implementation of relevant decisions and programmes .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
It also suggests an approach that consists of a careful selection of specific activities within the sector , followed by interactions among developing countries on the conceptual plane in the first instance , moving on to detailed technical work involving programme / project preparation , analysis and implementation .  
Examination and recommendation to developing countries on a continuing basis , in the light of changing circumstances and emerging conditions of specific areas and capacities relating to economic cooperation among developing countries and to technical cooperation among developing countries for absorbing lessons from the success of other developing countries .  
The national committees for the Decade and related technical agencies of the industrialized countries have remained active in the respective countries and have pursued a variety of collaborative relationships with neighbouring countries , and supported disaster-reduction initiatives in developing countries .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the ILO International Training Centre have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
Empowerment in this regard might be perceived as adopting a correct ( technical / organizational ) approach , based on alternative sets of prescriptive rules developed by experts .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
The operational and administrative procedures that the ministries use to conduct their day-to-day business need to be improved , and there needs to be ( a ) a degree of decentralization of decision-making to qualified managers and technical specialists ; ( b ) a building up of a professional civil service based on merit ; ( c ) an improvement in communication flows within the ministries ; and ( d ) a procedure for record-keeping in order to establish a solid foundation for institutional memory . 
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
International economic , trade and development cooperation : As the world 's fourteenth largest trading nation and the sixth largest outbound investor , the Republic of China on Taiwan is willing to share its own development experience and achievements with the international community and has already offered to developing countries financial and technical assistance for development projects .  
Specific reimbursement rates for environmental and intensified operational use conditions would be recommended by the initial United Nations technical survey team for approval within the mission budget and revised as required by changing circumstances .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
Among the points of discussion were the recruitment of students to central or local mine-clearance training schools ; the need for expatriate staff or technical advisers to stay on after the initial establishment of a national demining programme ; a recommendation that the United Nations provide pre-tailored material for new demining operations , including standard operating procedures , training and materials .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
The regulatory activities of the judges during the first half of 1994 , which for journalists were overly technical and which held little meaning among the general public , together with the preparatory work of the Deputy Prosecutor , which appeared dry work , were not initially helpful to the Tribunal when it came to overcoming the scepticism expressed throughout the first months of its existence .  
FAO reported that , in support of its technical advisory assistance to member countries in the field of water law and its administration , it had issued in 1994 a publication entitled " Preparing national regulations for water resources management : principles and practice " ( FAO Legislative Study Series , No . 52 ) , which consisted of a manual providing conceptual material for use in the preparation of national regulations for the management , development , use and protection of freshwater resources . 
Smaller specialized agencies have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with highly focused subsectoral issues and that operational activities should remain flexible to meet requirements in these specific technical areas .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the International Trade Centre ( ITC ) have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ; 
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
With the increased importance of NGOs in the United Nations system , this constituency and the scholarly community have a major role to play in channelling relevant information and research results , developing teaching materials , engaging in advocacy and sponsoring fruitful technical assistance activities , as the correctional training initiatives have recently demonstrated .  
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
At the same time , operational activities are to be expanded significantly and a solid base for technical cooperation and assistance established , to strengthen the programme 's role as a service provider , as well as an honest broker in putting prospective donors and clients in touch , promoting international exchanges , coordinating regional and interregional action , etc .  
However , since the UNDP basic needs questionnaire does not include this problem area , and countries or other entities are often unaware that this United Nations programme exists , including national planning offices charged with formalizing technical cooperation projects , its potential contribution is apt to be ignored and its inclusion in country programmes , with their competing priorities , unlikely or chancy at best .  
We believe that the formulation of this concept , including aspects of financial , material and technical support by the international community for the peace process in Liberia , requires a realistic , weighted approach based on the provisions of previous Security Council resolutions .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
It was agreed that the Committee should be flexible and simply take note of the existence of national institutions , irrespective of the political or ideological regime under which they had been established , bearing in mind that they could be improved and that technical assistance could be provided to that end .  
Although international contractual personnel were supposed to be recruited for technical and trades and crafts-related functions , a substantial number have been employed to perform administrative core functions that should have been assigned to United Nations staff members .  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
The experience gained over 30 years demonstrates the utility of free and unrestricted exchange of information through a dedicated global means of communication linked to individual national technical agencies .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
NULLWhile there is no comprehensive international programme for the early warning of geophysical hazards , there are some internationally acknowledged technical facilities or national agencies which collect , analyse and disseminate information regarding global seismic and volcanic events .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
The experiences of both WMO and IAEA demonstrate that a sustained and broadly based effort , drawing on the distributed technical abilities of various institutions and national collaborators , is critical for the successful coordination of international warning systems .  
" A technical consultation on sustainable fisheries development in the area of the FAO Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission ( WECAFC ) , held at Caraballada , Venezuela , from 18 to 22 October 1993 , agreed that the conflict between industrial and artisanal fisheries continued to be a problem in the region , given the difficulties of coming up with equitable solutions .  
" In addition to international developments related to the elaboration of the 1982 Convention , FAO continued to stress , in fisheries policy and technical advice provided to its developing members , that the implementation of conservation and management measures in exclusive economic zones would be unlikely to bring sustained long-term benefits in the absence of sound , reliable and cost-effective MCS systems . 
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
NULLGovernments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training that is relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
It also continued to collaborate actively with regional organizations in Africa , and to provide extensive technical assistance for the effective management of policy reforms in many areas , including public finance , monetary policy , debt management and exchange rate management , as well as in the design of social safety nets .  
In addition , it promotes assessment , integrated development and management of water resources ; and addresses the need for planned mineral resources exploration and development and responsible land use , through training , exchange of information , technical advice and the strengthening of relevant national and regional institutions .  
Promotes regional and subregional cooperation on modalities for addressing critical issues faced by disadvantaged groups in societies undergoing rapid change , with particular consideration to technical cooperation among developing countries through the organization of national and subregional training workshops and field study-cum-seminar programmes ;  
They receive the label " untrustworthy " , which effectively bars them from engaging in professional or technical work and blocks their access to administrative posts or positions of responsibility or employment in a foreign firm , even though their qualifications and skills may make them ideal candidates for the job .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training that is relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Although concrete results have been reached over the past few years in improving the technical infrastructure at the Palais des Nations , the physical distribution of buildings and the relative autonomy of many Secretariat organizational units located in Geneva , made it difficult for the Electronic Services Section of the United Nations Office at Geneva to provide the increasing amount of services required .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
The management stated , in its response , that the original request for proposal dated 1 August 1990 was formulated with the objectives of ( a ) identifying a state-of-the-art access control system that would generally meet the technical and security requirements of the United Nations and ( b ) identifying prospective contractors capable of supplying such a system .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
provide a wide range of health services , which includes preventive , curative , health protection and promotion , environmental health and family health programmes , to meet the refugees ' basic needs and improve their overall state of health , with professional and technical assistance from the World Health Organization ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly , on a biennial basis , a report entitled " State of South-South cooperation " containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in this regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation as well as recommendations for strengthening such cooperation , keeping in view the importance of the proposal to convene a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation no later than 1997 ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly , on a biennial basis , a report entitled " State of South-South cooperation " containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in this regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation as well as recommendations for strengthening such cooperation , keeping in view the importance of the proposal to convene a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation ;  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly , on a biennial basis , a report entitled " State of South-South cooperation " containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in this regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation as well as recommendations for strengthening such cooperation , keeping in view the importance of the proposal to convene a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation no later than 1997 ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly , on a biennial basis , a report entitled " State of South-South cooperation " containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in this regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation as well as recommendations for strengthening such cooperation , keeping in view the importance of the proposal to convene a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation ;  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
were only two solutions : one would be for the current system to be radically changed so as to incorporate the specialized agencies as major players in determining conditions of service for the staff ; the other would be to allow the staff of the specialized agencies and technical programmes to develop their own system so that they could get on with the important tasks that needed to be addressed urgently .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
conceptual framework incorporating socio-economic and gender analysis at the macro ( inter-household ) and micro ( intra-household ) level with people 's participation and conflict resolution has been developed and is being operationalized through a socio-economic and gender analysis field manual accompanied by an open-ended series of technical supplements , which will be concise , sector and subsector specific guides to utilizing the socio-economic and gender analysis paradigm .  
Its main objective is to regulate the administrative decentralization of our executive power , which , in the framework of the Republic 's unified approach , involves shifting and delegating technical and administrative functions that are not exclusive to the national executive power .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris  
They conveyed the Community 's proposal to dispatch a Ministerial Trade and Investment Mission to South Africa at a mutually convenient date in 1997 and also to establish a joint CARICOM Diplomatic Mission in South Africa in the near future to advance economic , technical and cultural relations with the countries of southern Africa and with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
We would therefore be deeply appreciative if this understanding were translated into tangible results and if the subsequent technical discussions held following political consultations were much more fruitful .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
Enhanced international technical assistance and advisory services can decisively strengthen national capacities and the institutional bases for supporting national plans and strategies that are designed to bring about sustained and sustainable social development .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .  I should now like to turn to the other , technical draft resolution before the Council .  
Those acting at the international level have long been recognized for their contributing role in advocating for reproductive rights and reproductive health and for providing assistance to national Governments and national non-governmental organizations in technical aspects of population , family planning and reproductive health programmes .  
The Committee had played a vital role in promoting economic , social and cultural rights , by formulating final views on the way in which States had fulfilled their Covenant obligations , by defining its General Comments as a basis for jurisprudence in that area , by discussing the question of the elaboration of an optional protocol to the Covenant that would allow individuals and groups to present legal complaints with regard to the violation of one or several of the rights protected by the Covenant , and by successfully conducting its first technical assistance mission .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the tenth session , as approved at the ninth session , taking fully into account the results of the ninth session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
ILO aimed , in the context of technical programmes implemented at the national level , to give women the means to play a more active economic role by organizing vocational training courses for them in areas traditionally reserved for men , by proposing various measures to develop their entrepreneurship and by organizing workshops to teach them to organize themselves better vis - - vis their employers and to negotiate better working conditions .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
Military contingents , including military , technical and rear support units ( subunits ) , shall be fully supplied with weapons and military equipment , spare parts and military and technical supplies , and technical servicing , evacuation and repair components under schedules , tables and norms specially drawn up for them , taking into account the physical and geographical conditions of the region in which their tasks are carried out and in accordance with individual agreements .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality and to assist Member States in achieving the goals of preventing crime within and among States and improving the response to crime , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46 / 152 and in line with the recommendations of the Ninth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly , on a biennial basis , a report entitled " State of South-South cooperation " containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in this regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation as well as recommendations for strengthening such cooperation , keeping in view the importance of the proposal to convene a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation ;  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Welcoming the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The Office has documented numerous case-studies worldwide of management and technical changes that have led to reduced environmental impacts and improved economic performance .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
With a view to achieving these aims , it is essential to eliminate duplication and strengthen cooperation between relevant international organizations , in particular UNCTAD , WTO and the International Trade Centre UNCTAD / GATT , in order to conserve scarce resources and make full use of the existing and potential synergies among these organizations .  Among the measures that should be considered is the establishment of a technical assistance fund administered by WTO in order to help LDCs participate actively in WTO .  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions on the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance during the transition period , a process of peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building , in particular its resolutions 49 / 137 and 49 / 21 I of 19 and 20 December 1994 , respectively , which emphasize the compelling need to design a new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities established by the Governments of the region ,  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of the International Conference on Central American Refugees and in the new subregional development strategy , the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Recognizing that El Salvador is at a complex stage in the process of consolidating peace , which calls not only for the implementation of the remaining commitments under the Peace Agreement but also for a new approach involving the implementation and consolidation of medium-term and long-term national development programmes and strategies aimed at resolving the structural problems that are the cause of tension and social instability , and emphasizing the importance and necessity of international technical and financial assistance , both bilateral and multilateral ,  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
At its twelfth meeting , the Group of Experts identified several high-priority areas , such as advice in policy formulation and implementation strategies , administrative restructuring for economic reform , people-oriented development , strategic fiscal and financial management , and strengthening of training in , for example , evaluation and management of change , in which Member States may seek technical help from United Nations agencies . 
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
While the main efforts for administrative improvement must be initiated and sustained at the national level , it needs to be recognized that technical cooperation with international and regional institutions , including regional United Nations agencies , will be vital in assisting and supporting the process of improvement .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
The technical and professional posts remaining in the Department for Development Support and Management Services were to constitute the minimal critical mass needed to provide substantive support to overall planning and management activities in mineral resources in line with the mandate of the Department .  
In Viet Nam , a technical cooperation project was recently completed that assisted the Government in completing a new mining law , together with the implementation of regulations and a model mining agreement , and in establishing an administrative framework for the effective operation of the new legislation and the sustainable development of the mining sector .  
Just prior to the restructuring of the United Nations Secretariat in the areas of economic and social development in 1993 , UNDP , the principal funding agency for United Nations technical cooperation activities in mineral resources , revised the funding priorities and the funding mechanism by which United Nations agencies were supported in their technical cooperation activities .  
The Governing Council of UNDP , at its thirty-eighth session ( 1991 ) , adopted comprehensive legislation , in keeping with General Assembly resolution 44 / 211 on the comprehensive triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , that put forth new initiatives relating to the national execution of technical cooperation activities , and the development of projects according to an integrated and prioritized national programme , and placed renewed emphasis on human development and capacity-building in development activities .  
While the United Nations system continues to provide technical cooperation assistance and advisory services of a neutral and non-commercial nature in the field of mineral resources at the request of Member States , its ability to do so has been severely diminished owing to evolutions in the funding of technical cooperation activities , and current budgetary reductions and the financial situation in the United Nations Secretariat .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
Furthermore , the General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and expressed its appreciation for the provision of the services of two interregional advisers .  
During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
It stressed the need to assist States in the task of building and strengthening adequate structures through technical assistance to national projects in reforming penal and correctional establishments , in education and training of lawyers , judges and security forces in human rights , and in other specific spheres of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law .  
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
As described in greater detail in the report of the Secretary-General on technical advisory services for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme ( E / CN . 15 / 1996 / 8 ) , such resources could be used for technical cooperation activities and advisory services geared towards building and supporting democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems with emphasis on the complementary relationship of justice , peace and development and the need to address them simultaneously .  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
The fifth objective is to facilitate appropriate follow-up and complementary work to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme studies and research and analysis of the economic and social impact of drug production , trafficking and consumption , as well as formulations of alternative development programmes to remedy this impact , and to provide technical assistance in the formulation of national policies to prevent and reduce the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances . 
To that end , the co-sponsors invited individuals from specific governmental agencies and private industries to attend and , in order to receive the full benefit of the programme , the co-sponsors also requested that each participating organization or company wishing to attend the Conference should send both the chief operating officer or the equivalent and the senior technical officer .  
26 Mechanisms used for accessing the resources and expertise of FLC included sharing information , exchanging personnel , finding technical assistance , using unique federal laboratory facilities and capabilities , licensing patents and technical know-how , acquiring software , performing cooperative research and development , using cooperative research and development agreements directly with private companies and other entities , working cooperatively with NASA , forming consortia and using technology developed under government contracts .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
Furthermore , while some countries apply the principle of the total programme approach and national execution to all sources / projects of technical cooperation , in most countries existing NEX development planning structures / procedures do not provide for the integration of activities other than those falling strictly within the UNDP country programme ( excluding , for example , projects executed through bilateral aid , development financing institutions , multilateral organizations , trust funds and so forth ) .

The purpose was to provide graduates , sponsored by their Governments , with the opportunity to work in the field under the direction of senior experts or senior staff members of the United Nations in order to assist developing countries through the implementation of technical cooperation projects .  Over the course of time , a number of such associate experts have been assigned to functions carried out by offices at headquarters , usually in economic and social research and analysis ; those at headquarters offices are also sometimes referred to as " junior professional officers " .  
The status of associate experts is clearly defined : they are staff members at the junior professional level , subject to the provisions of the Charter and Staff Regulations ; they can not seek or accept instructions concerning the performance of their duties from any Government , including their own , or from any authority outside the Organization ; conditions of service are specified in a letter of appointment , under the 200 series of the Staff Rules for technical assistance project personnel , on a fixed-term appointment , generally for a period not exceeding four years .  
The principles elaborated in the above-mentioned administrative instruction on non-reimbursable loans for technical cooperation projects ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) , particularly in terms of an agreement or understanding between the United Nations and the donor and the issuance of a special service agreement with the individual , have been applied only in a limited number of cases .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .

Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fishery-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized , and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fishery organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;

Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but that face economic hardship ;  
In the composition of subsidiary organs , emphasis shall be placed on the need for members qualified and competent in relevant technical matters dealt with by those organs , provided that due account shall be taken of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and of special interests .  
In fact , the concept is embedded in the FAO Constitution , Article VII , paragraph 3 , which states : " In appointing the staff , the Director-General shall , subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and technical competence , pay due regard to the importance of selecting personnel recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible " .

Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .

Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
It had been agreed , in the preliminary exchanges of views , that the Working Group 's visit could with advantage be preceded by a preparatory visit so that , firstly , the Group could more easily take cognizance of certain constraints , political or technical ( for example the problem of distances ) , facing such a visit and to have a better understanding of Chinese law , in particular with regard to the difficulties entailed in bringing it into conformity with the international instruments on human rights .  
The remaining issues could be divided into two categories : the procedural or technical ones could be addressed during the nine weeks of further work recommended by the Preparatory Committee ; and the substantive issues requiring high-level political decisions could be finally resolved only at the conference .  
His delegation recognized the major technical difficulties involved in the constitution of such a court , which involved striking a careful balance between procedural concepts and political interests , and ensuring that both the procedural rights of the accused and the right to justice of the victims and the international community were taken into account .

Traditionally , technical assistance has been provided in the context of economic and social development , with the main emphasis on building and strengthening physical infrastructure and the executive arm of the Government ; assistance in governance beyond that was made virtually impossible by the political climate throughout most of the United Nations history .  
Coordination of international actors is essential to avoid waste and duplication and , more importantly , to avoid conflicting advice from technical consultants , programmes working at cross purposes and over-funding of or inordinate attention to particular aspects of the democratization process to the detriment of others ; the last could lead in turn to an imbalance between the capacities of State and civic institutions .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management ; the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .

Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris , including spacecraft design measures to protect against space debris ( ibid . , paras .  102-103 ) .

The United Arab Emirates pins great hopes on international development assistance in support of plans for the establishment of national Palestinian institutions and for developing the local technical capacities of the Palestinian people in order to enable it to implement its economic and social development plans with a view to its proper integration into international trade .  
In fact , the much-needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people also remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , which still continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they had designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .  
The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .

Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Play the focal role in promoting close coordination of all aspects of the statistical activities of specialized agencies , relevant United Nations bodies and other international organizations in regard to their work in the Asia and Pacific region , inter alia so as to achieve greater uniformity in concepts and definitions , reduce to a minimum the response burden on national statistical offices , and maximize the effectiveness of technical cooperation activities .  
The Conference has been recognized as a forum for technical cooperation , technology transfer and programme coordination for the countries of the Americas region , providing government officials , planners , scientists and experts from the Americas and elsewhere with an opportunity to address common needs , problems and experiences in the field of surveying and mapping , cartography , hydrography , remote sensing , and land and geographical information systems , including educational and training aspects , scientific and technological requirements , implementation issues and benefits . 
Important issues highlighted by the participants for consideration in cadastral surveying and land management included the recognition that the success of a cadastral system was dependent not only on its legal or technical sophistication , but also on whether it protected land rights adequately , and permitted those rights to be recorded ( when appropriate ) efficiently , simply , quickly , securely and at low cost .  
The Civil Affairs Unit has focused on the wide range of issues related to civilian reintegration , including the technical and substantive matters addressed in the 24 joint implementation committees and subcommittees which brought together Serb and Croat experts to resolve mutual problems .  
The Mission continued to stress the need to plan the short , medium and long-term phases of this complex process , bearing in mind the political , technical and social implications of the reform .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
A strong , almost visionary political will would allow the implementation of article 2 of the Covenant , wherein each State Party undertakes " to take steps , individually and through international assistance and cooperation , especially economic and technical , to the maximum of its available resources , with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant " ( . . . ) .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
A major strategic study carried out jointly by UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) indicates that under current conditions a significant portion of the beneficiaries farming systems will be viable over the next five years only if they receive an additional , medium-term programme of support that includes locally based technical assistance , timely credit with special conditions , and social and productive infrastructure .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
Despite the advances that have been registered in the processes of national reconstruction and development , on which I shall be submitting a separate report to the General Assembly pursuant to the request contained in Assembly resolution 50 / 58 C of 12 December 1995 , the technical and financial assistance of the international community remains necessary .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The high technical and professional standard of Cubas scientific work force , allied to the major achievements in the development of the chemical-pharmaceutical , biotechnological and medical equipment industries , is leading Cuba to concentrate its efforts and resources on programmes that generate export earnings , for which purpose we are working hard to find markets in which to expand our exports to the maximum .  
Under the wise leadership of the great leader , the people in the northern half of our Republic vigorously accelerated the three revolutions , ideological , technical and cultural , holding high the banner of the Juche idea , and thus cemented rock-firm our revolutionary base , a decisive guarantee of national reunification .  
The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
The Committee was concerned about the low level of occupational achievement by educated women and male dominance in technical and professional fields , on the one hand , and the concentration of women in the lower-paid service sector , in particular the tourist industry , on the other .  
As for trade statistics , the mission focused attention on : ( i ) ascertaining the technical capabilities and work plan of the PCBS with regard to the compilation , processing , analysis , and dissemination of Palestinian foreign trade statistics ; ( ii ) identifying the nature and extent of needs of the PCBS for technical assistance in the area of international trade statistics ; and , ( iii ) developing relevant proposals for manpower training .  
UNCTAD 's mission , fielded in 1996 , was particularly focused on an investigation of : ( i ) the system and procedures currently adopted for the generation of customs and trade data ; ( ii ) technical , financial and logistical requirements for introducing systems aimed at improving customs administration , collection of customs revenues and compilation of comprehensive trade data ; and , ( iii ) other related aspects of customs administration , including the feasibility of computerization in customs administration and eventual installation of the Automated System for Customs Data ( ASYCUDA ) .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
The balance of the temporary assistance funding ( $ 634,900 ) , the same level as approved for the biennium 1996-1997 , will provide for : ( a ) administrative and technical support during the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Management Information System ( IMIS ) and the further implementation of remaining phases of the Fund 's computer project ; ( b ) assistance during peak workload periods , and ( c ) replacements of staff on maternity and extended sick leaves . 
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Operating through a regional unit , which was in contact with the national technical units , the project assisted countries in the formulation of policies and programmes in the social sector and sought to strengthen national management capabilities in the social sectors of the countries concerned with special emphasis on the sectors of basic education , health , nutrition and the strengthening of social investment funds .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
Natural disasters , which brought devastation to the small island States in particular , also had a severe impact at the global level and required urgent action by the international community and the transfer of adequate technical and scientific knowledge .  
Developing countries increasingly required the technical assistance and capacity-building services of the united Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , which supported endeavours to create an environment propitious for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
It seems to us that the CD , with its accumulated experience of complex disarmament negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , is the ideal forum in which to carry forward discussions on the technical and legal questions which must be confronted if we are to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
In its resolution 50 / 119 of 20 December 1995 , entitled Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to present to it on a biennial basis a report entitled State of South-South cooperation containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in that regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
However , it is fundamentally true that the overall monitoring system could only be made comprehensive when the Council is able to conclude that Iraq 's prohibited programmes have been destroyed , removed or rendered harmless and the full extent of the level of technical development achieved in each of the prohibited programmes is known .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
The unique advantage of UNDP in this area derives from its extensive field presence in the region , its role as a trusted and objective provider of information and advice and coordinator of United Nations system programmes , its widespread contacts with governmental and non-governmental entities , and its growing body of technical expertise in country offices .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Taking note also of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-first annual meeting , [ 3 ] held in New York on 26 September 1997 , in which the Ministers emphasized the increasing importance and complementarity of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries as a means of supporting and broadening the global partnership in international development cooperation ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .  
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
An economy that results in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service is a false economy and the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget are realistic and reliable .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
Informal , democratic , transparent , universal , open and announced negotiations held in this official Headquarters with technical services can not be replaced by other forms of negotiations which , in lacking these elements , could only be considered complementary to them , if even that .  
Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
UNDCP is assisting the Government in establishing a permanent institution at the national level responsible for raising funds and planning , coordinating , implementing and monitoring technical cooperation in alternative development projects in the country .  
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical , managerial , monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
In addition , China has developed rewarding systems for young people such as the Ten Top Chinese Young People , prominent young entrepreneurs , prominent young township entrepreneurs , young technical pace-setters , young skilful workers at their posts , rural young shooting star guides , the Chinese young scientist prize and Chinese youth science and technology pioneering prizes .  
The disappointing results in the utilization of renewable energy sources are attributable mainly to a lack of information on the economic and technical viability of the technologies in small island developing States , and unaffordable prices of existing technologies , especially solar energy technology .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .

Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
The main responsibility of Governments is to " provide the required budgetary resources to the educational sector , with reallocation within the educational sector to ensure increased funds for basic education " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( a ) ) and " to monitor the implementation of educational reforms and measures in relevant ministries , and establish technical assistance programmes " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( b ) ) .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .

The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
In order to foster the effective implementation of the Convention and to encourage international cooperation in the area of juvenile justice , the Committee transmits , as it may consider appropriate , to specialized agencies , UNICEF and other competent bodies any reports from States parties that contain a request , or indicate a need , for advisory services and technical assistance , along with observations and suggestions of the Committee , if any , on those requests or indications ( in accordance with article 45 ( b ) of the Convention ) .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .

It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
Complementary efforts for the provision of technical support by a variety of national , regional and international organizations should be encouraged and coordinated in strengthening global spatial data infrastructure activities .

Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation may be seen as a complement to the monitoring activities of the human rights programme from which no Government is exempt , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;

The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Since those rules were of a technical nature , they did not require any further clarification ; however , Committee members were free to comment on them , either during the forthcoming discussion or in the observations of individual States , which the Commission and its Special Rapporteur awaited with interest .  16 .  Article 27 , which was the last provision of the draft articles , had been included at a late stage and the decision as to its placement in the text had been left for the second reading .

Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .

The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Its portrayal of these problems , however , as being such that they can not be solved through a technical process only and as requiring a major political solution is incorrect and contradicts the conclusion drawn in paragraph 46 that not much is unknown about Iraq 's proscribed capabilities .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
This includes improved contribution to the work of those bodies on the development and updating of a wide range of international legal instruments , regulations and recommendations that provide a common technical and legal basis for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks , for the improvement of the efficiency , safety and environmental performance of the transport sector and for the facilitation of border crossing .  
As part of this , it will coordinate region-wide data collection , analysis , training and technical assistance activities designed to expand policy-relevant knowledge of ( a ) demographic processes , such as family transformation and childbearing , international migration and integration of foreigners , population ageing and changes among older people and shifts in the health status of mothers , children and other population groups ; and ( b ) interrelationships between these processes and economic and social developments . 
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In the Turks and Caicos Islands , technical cooperation has been largely aimed at direct interventions with a view to laying the basis for meaningful economic development .

Calls for the facilitation of access by all Non-Self-Governing Territories to relevant United Nations programmes whose objectives are the promotion of the social , educational , technical , environmental , cultural and economic well-being of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to assist in the timely progression of the process of self-determination ;  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
In July 1996 , an important joint letter addressed to the staff of IMF and that of UNDP on cooperation between the two organizations was signed by their two executive heads , who called on their members to collaborate more closely on new and ongoing technical assistance , country strategy notes ( when requested by Governments ) and policy framework papers and stressing the need for greater collaboration in post - and near-crisis countries and in countries engaged in programmes involving market-oriented reforms and transition .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
We are encountering many complexities in these conditions , and these require radical organizational and institutional restructuring , vast resources and the relevant modern technologies and specialized technical know-how .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
Entitled " Putting peace to work : priorities and strategies for the development effort in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1997 " , these papers articulated a coordinated and targeted approach to the main developmental priorities , as identified by the Palestinian Authority , and included proposals from United Nations agencies and programmes for specific technical and project assistance for implementation beginning in late 1996 and 1997 .  
ESCWA has focused its activities on supporting the economic and social sectors in the occupied territories as well as monitoring their developments through the provision of advisory services and technical assistance and the preparation of reports , analytical studies and project proposals regarding the rehabilitation of the Palestinian economy .  
The consultations had provided an opportunity for agencies to present their activities and to discuss possible cooperation on , for example : joint input to the Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission and the Working Group , the provision of relevant information to be included on a website page , joint minority-related technical cooperation projects , submission of information on system-wide complaints procedures , input into the treaty bodies , dissemination of the recommendations and resolutions of supervisory bodies , and the provision of training on minority-related human rights instruments at regional and national levels .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;

Traditional cultural , social and religious values and practices had reinforced the lower status which society accorded to women and had restricted their opportunities for education , technical and vocational training and employment , thereby limiting their participation in the overall development process .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The progressive movement from exclusive reliance on remote monitoring by national technical means towards more cooperative and intrusive methods , including on-site inspections , is a noteworthy trend that is likely to continue with START III .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .  
The purpose of the review is to provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of the implementation of the Convention commitments ; to review , in a facilitative , non-confrontational , open and transparent manner , the information contained in the national communications ; and to ensure that the COP has accurate , consistent and relevant information at its disposal .  
Financial , material and technical assistance complemented by a favourable international economic environment was imperative for the realization of the strategic objectives set out in Beijing .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .

The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .

All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
Scientific and technical progress is never used for purposes that are incompatible with the enjoyment of any human rights , including every individual 's right to life , health , liberty of person and privacy .  On the contrary , full support and encouragement is given to every materially and mentally creative innovator through the organization of annual specialized exhibitions for this purpose .  
Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls upon all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
In terms of people , the asset-owners , profit-earners , rentiers , the educated , the mobile and those with professional , managerial or technical skills are the winners , whereas the asset less , wage-earners , debtors , uneducated , immobile and the semi-skilled or unskilled are the losers .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity in the peace and security , political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote the mobilization of adequate technical assistance and funding and the full utilization of existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and make use of the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls upon all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
In this connection , the Advisory Committee was informed that serious constraints have also been encountered in obtaining the dedicated services of requisite personnel from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations owing to the current rapid expansion of United Nations peacekeeping activities , as well as in retaining highly skilled technical IMIS staff and finding qualified personnel in the field of information technology under the current United Nations salary scales .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
The relationship between the environment and mankind had been discussed at Rio , where it had been recognized that States had common but differentiated responsibilities and that sustainable development required adequate scientific , technical and financial resources .  
It was proposed that two types of recommendations could normally be addressed to States parties by the Subcommittee : ( a ) those for more or less speedy implementation by the States parties themselves ; and ( b ) those which were supposed to be progressively implemented by the States parties through technical assistance and cooperation financed by the special fund to be set up pursuant to article 17 .  
With a view to fostering participation of foreign companies and maximizing competition , the contracting authority may wish to have the invitations to the pre-selection proceedings made public also in a language customarily used in international trade , in a newspaper of wide international circulation or in a relevant trade publication or technical or professional journal of wide international circulation .  
17 .  Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize adequate technical assistance and funding and to utilize fully existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote the mobilization of adequate technical assistance and funding and the full utilization of existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission , was revised to read :  
Concerned at the uncertain situation of the Centre for International Crime Prevention , her delegation believed that that body should be provided with adequate resources to provide Member States with the technical assistance needed to ensure the rule of law and juvenile justice , and to elaborate model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the need for effective global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote further and more rapid progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
Further recognizing the continuing need for the international community to extend technical and other support , including , inter alia , enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt-for-industrial-development swaps and enhanced market access to enable the continent to leverage domestic and international resources and investment to take advantage of the increasing role of the private sector ,  
The matter of displaced persons and refugees could be settled only with the participation of the international community as a whole in establishing plans for integrated economic and social development through increased financial and technical cooperation .  
It was also printed out that compulsory military service does not consist solely in combat duties ; there are many administrative , technical and clerical posts in which military service can be performed in a manner consistent with every persons physical and mental aptitudes .  
Moreover , accusations have been based on highly questionable expert reports , such as autopsies failing to meet technical requirements or ballistic tests performed on manipulated evidence , as in the Xamn case , or superfluous procedures , such as the ballistic test performed on hogs in the same case .  
As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
In 1992 , the member countries signed the Maastricht Treaty , agreeing to eliminate over 280 physical , technical , and fiscal barriers to the creation of a single market , and moved one step closer to the final stage of currency union .  
The Commission examined the issue in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , and reported its conclusions to the Assembly in its annual reports for those years . 4 The responses of the Commission were based on extensive consultations and studies in the context of which it had sought advice from ACPAQ , its expert technical body on post adjustment , and the views of a legal consultant and several legal experts , the Legal Counsel of the United Nations and the legal advisers of the organizations . 
The Commission continues to believe that the existence of a national border in close proximity to the duty station makes Geneva a distinct situation which justifies the current post adjustment system , which was tailored to reflect that difference ; the legal , administrative , and technical difficulties associated with any of the above-described changes to the current arrangement militate strongly against implementation of those changes .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
Norway fully supports the cooperation between the OIC and the United Nations in their common search for solutions to global problems related to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic , social and technical development .  
Paragraph 3 requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
Recognizing the importance of a sound economy to social and political stability , the European Union will continue its considerable economic and technical assistance to the Palestinians with a view to contributing to a more secure and prosperous future for them in the next millennium .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
We have acquired impressive scientific , technical and industrial potential and expertise in the area of mine clearance which could be put to use in future international programmes in this sphere .  
The first stage was mine removal associated with the demarcation of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border , which , under mutual agreement with Ecuador , was performed with national resources and the supplementary technical and financial support of four friendly countries : Canada , Spain , the United States and Japan , to whom we reaffirm our gratitude for their swift and favourable acceptance of our requests for assistance . 
Due to the magnitude of the problem and the climatic and geographic characteristics of mined zones , we believe that this stage can be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the Ottawa Convention only if we can gain access to technical and financial cooperation and to logistical support given by other States parties to the Ottawa Convention , non-governmental organizations and international organizations that are committed to the cause of achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines .  
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
India is vitally interested in peace , development and stability in the Middle East , a region close to our heart and with which we share bonds of history and culture , reinforced in modern times through multifaceted cooperation encompassing trade , investment , cultural exchanges , technical assistance and human resource development . 
Plans will also include the design and implementation of a national policy specifically directed towards youth to promote technical and vocational training , recreational and cultural facilities and the fostering of moral and civic values that will enable them to take an active part in Salvadoran society .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties . 
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial arrangements .  
18 . Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
The apparent economic and technical obsolescence of a major part of the fleet is necessarily reflected in higher operating costs , as repair and maintenance rapidly increase with age , schedule delays and unreliability , and greater environmental risks associated with obsolete vessels .  
While the Government of Ethiopia is encouraged by the results achieved and is committed to continuing the demining programme , it is recognized at the same time that much remains to be done to get rid of all the landmines scattered in various parts of the country , and that this immense task can not be completed without international support in the form of technical and financial assistance .  
Based on previous experience , member States closely involved in the preparations have worked hard to create a lean and efficient secretariat , which will be staffed by highly qualified professionals and will build on existing experience and technical expertise .  
It was difficult to believe that while Governments and international organizations were spending vast sums of money on bilateral and international law reform programmes , the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the United Nations body dealing specifically with international trade law was being funded from limited extrabudgetary resources in the form of special contributions by a very few Governments .  
Many mercenaries who are experts in the use of explosives and technical devices with destructive material effects are hired to commit deadly attacks that cause collective fear and dread or , in other words , indiscriminate terror .  
Generally speaking , these approaches and ideas have been put forward in the various countries in which UNIAPRAVIs ideas have become established.They have been disseminated through three main channels : firstly , through international meetings organized , promoted or attended by UNIAPRAVI ; secondly , through documents and publications prepared by UNIAPRAVI ; and , thirdly , through the provision of technical assistance and advice requested by members .  
Various workshops and round tables on reproductive health rights and a technical symposium on international migration and development which had called special attention to female migrant workers had been held in the context of the five-year review of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development .  
Also invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in close cooperation with the regional economic commissions , within their respective mandates and current resources , as well as with other relevant international organizations , to provide technical assistance and advisory services to the newly independent landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , taking into account the relevant transit transport agreements ;  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
In its resolution 1998 59 , the Commission requested the independent expert to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical cooperation through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector .  
The political and electoral platform has emphasized the migrants cost to society , yet has omitted their very important contributions in the cultural , scientific , technical , social and economic fields . 
The reportedly typical public building accommodation visited by the Representative provides cramped living space , with extended families occupying single rooms originally designed to house one student attending higher education or technical institutes .  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
The development of renewable energy sources will depend not only on the choice of appropriate technology but also on adequate development of managerial and technical expertise , careful financial management and adoption of appropriate institutional approaches .  
Commending the work of the Intergovernmental Expert Group Meeting on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters , held at Arlington , Virginia , United States of America , from 23 to 26 February 1998 , to implement in part resolution 52 88 by proposing complementary provisions for the Model Treaty , elements for inclusion in model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters , and training and technical assistance for national officials engaged in that field ,  
To continue to provide advisory and technical cooperation services to Member States requesting assistance in drafting and implementing appropriate national legislation and in developing and implementing bilateral , subregional , regional or international treaties on mutual assistance in criminal matters , drawing on the expertise of Member States as appropriate ;  
Its dangerous waste control regulations , drawn up on the basis of the provisions of the Basel Convention embody the technical and legal principles applicable to the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes in the light of current programmes and policies , and prohibit the import of any type of waste .  
While highlighting the primary responsibility of national Governments for the development and promotion of SMEs , representatives from developing countries emphasized the critical need for appropriate support and assistance from the international community , particularly through the UNCTAD technical assistance programmes which were relevant to enterprise development .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
In order to overcome the difficulties , intensive technical assistance will be needed from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , including training courses , seminars and workshops , with a view to removing the major political , cultural and social obstacles to the consolidation of the democratic process and the effective exercise of human rights .  
The additional international legal instruments were viewed as optional protocols to the convention , covering specific areas of a rather technical nature and dealing with the consequent need for specificity , which the convention could not meet .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , administrative or technical opportunities for criminal organizations to commit profitable crimes and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Information contained in the report , which is submitted pursuant to resolution 1998-19 , is drawn from the concluding observations of the relevant treaty bodies , the reports of the special representatives and special rapporteurs submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its last session , the annual report on activities undertaken in the area of advisory services and technical cooperation , and the report of the Working Group on Minorities at its fourth session .  
The visit was an occasion for examining specific technical questions raised by the considerable strengthening of the 102 nd military base established in Armenia , the new aircraft unit to be supplied to that base , the improvement of the operation of the unified air defence system which was to be equipped with modern armaments , including S-300 surface-to-air missile batteries , and questions concerning of the permanent deployment in the territory of Armenia of Russian Mig-29 aircraft .  
Taking into account the fact that data on some cross-sectoral areas such as national institutions and administrative capacity , regional institutions and technical cooperation , and some data on science and technology are subsumed under sectoral areas in the revised DAC purpose classification codes on which the analysis of the data is based , one can conclude that a number of important programme areas have not yet received adequate attention from the international community . 
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
Welcomes the convening , in 1999 , of an intergovernmental meeting of experts on the El Nio phenomenon , to be held at Lima , which will have a comprehensive approach , encompassing scientific , technical , social and political issues , and a broad participation of intergovernmental experts and policy decision makers ;  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of OHCHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The central capacity for the coordination of technical cooperation to which the posts proposed for redeployment were initially assigned during the biennium 19981999 was a transitional arrangement required in the period immediately following the merger of the three economic and social departments to oversee the establishment of a more decentralized system of managing technical cooperation projects with individual divisions directly responsible for their implementation .  
Now that the decentralization process has been completed , that arrangement has been replaced by an interdepartmental task force arrangement at the divisional director level , supported by the administrative unit dealing with technical cooperation , with the Assistant Secretary-General for Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs providing central oversight and policy guidance .  
The International Scientific and Educational Znanie Association is an international non-profit alliance of national and other non-governmental organizations which was voluntarily established and based on dissemination of scientific , technical and humanitarian knowledge for mutual benefit .  
The aim of the Union continues to be to promote , coordinate and develop at the international level the role of the notary as a technical and legal expert who ensures impartiality in private contractual relations , with the ultimate aim of forestalling and preventing controversies and conflicts .  
Provision of technical cooperation services , upon request , to countries of the region in connection with public-sector programming ; economic development and local management ; management of public territorial policies ; national public investment systems ; and integrated management of investment projects ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Other users will be business associations , labour organizations and technical and professional institutions connected with production sectors , universities , research centres , regional and subregional integration bodies and other public and private entities that require comparable information on the countries of the region , including experts working with UNDP and other United Nations bodies responsible for drafting reports and implementing technical cooperation projects .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
They addressed a wide range of technical issues , including the use of saline water in agriculture , improved techniques for the development of water resources , the breeding and development of wheat and barley varieties which can be disease-resistant and tolerant of drought conditions , improvements in small ruminant production and the conservation of biodiversity and the environment in the Arab region . 
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
UNCTAD ' s technical cooperation activities are an essential complement to its analytical and policy work , providing practical and direct benefits to recipient countries and also serving as a conduit for the assimilation of development experiences at the country and regional levels into more coherent and development-friendly policy approaches at the international level .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
His Government had provided a total of over US $ 2-billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral technical , scientific and economic cooperation to other developing countries and planned to extend its cooperation to include not only Asia and Africa , but also the South Pacific , the Caribbean and Central America and to promote the concept of multiple beneficiaries .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
Therefore , what is proposed is a decentralized technical , administrative and budgetary approach to a globally coordinated collaborative facilities management based on information exchange and common operational practices is therefore proposed .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;

Formal technical presentations during the first of the three sessions focused on the role of remote sensing in achieving national food security , mapping from space , agricultural applications of small satellites , as well as recent trends in remote sensing and meteorological and global navigation satellite systems .  
Moreover , the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects typically requires various measures beyond the establishment of an appropriate legislative framework , such as adequate administrative structures and practices , organizational capability , technical expertise , appropriate human and financial resources and economic stability .  
The main elements that characterize a particular market structure include barriers to the entry of competitors of an economic , legal , technical or other nature , the degree of vertical or horizontal integration , the number of companies operating in the market as well as the availability of substitute products or services .  
The growing number of requests received by OHCHR from Governments for specialized technical assistance and advisory services , for instance in the areas of legal reform or the strengthening of civil society , evidences a readiness on the part of Governments to engage partners such as the United Nations and NGOs to strengthen national human rights protection .  
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
In those days of deep crisis , Pakistan extended moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country in defence of international law and morality as a sign of our solidarity with them in the hour of suffering .  
This laid the groundwork for a strategic partnership with three major strands , one political , one economic and one cultural , educational , scientific and technical .  
It is intended that the Operational Support Manual will be modular , with a main doctrinal volume covering common procedures and a series of specialized technical volumes covering specific areas , such as engineering , communications , supply and so on .  
The General Assembly is the global institution with the competence to look at ocean affairs in a coordinated manner , integrating all aspects of ocean uses : political , legal , economic , social , environmental and technical .  
It had identified strengthened industrial capacity and clean and sustainable industrial development as the two main priority areas of its technical assistance to the developing countries .  
While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
During the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Pakistan extended unequivocal moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country , in defence of international law and morality and as proof of our solidarity with them .

Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
We are convinced that the extent of the current crisis requires a vigorous and systematic effort by the international community in mobilizing human , technical and financial resources to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
Alleviation of the adverse social , economic and political conditions that were at the root of the conflict required concerted global efforts to mobilize technical , human and financial resources .  
But its main task was to promote technical cooperation and implement integrated programmes , always bearing in mind the current technological revolution and the profound changes taking place in industrial organizations , especially transnational corporations .  
It was evident , however , that the results obtained had been modest and that new measures were required in order to improve regulation and prevent the adoption of protectionist measures based on technical , health , social or ecological criteria .  
In a sphere which was so complex at the technical level and so delicate at the political level , it was not advisable to adopt an innovative and revolutionary approach .  
The Cuban Governments unshakeable political will was reflected in the position achieved by women in Cuban society , their cultural , technical and professional level and their high rates of economic , political and social participation .  
The meeting also considered that the effective implementation of agreements required appropriate institutional arrangements at the national and regional levels as well as the financial and technical support of the international community .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .

The view was expressed that , while discussing barriers to the greater use of space applications and services within the United Nations system under the second year of the work plan , in 2002 , difficulties experienced by the satellite data user community , such as the exorbitant cost of data , lack of technical know-how and of equipment to process the data and use the products thereof and inappropriate spatial resolution , should be considered in detail by the Subcommittee in order to find reasonable solutions to those problems .  
On the contrary , the scientific and technical aspects of space debris were closely interrelated with political and legal aspects and it would not be feasible to attempt to resolve all scientific and technical issues without simultaneous consideration of those of a political and legal nature .  
Likewise , the political support of the United Nations in this case , the Security Council and the provision of material and technical assistance by the international community are essential for the successful implementation of the ECOWAS initiative to deploy a multinational ECOWAS Monitoring Group force along the borders of Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .  
It is imperative that the international community continue to provide technical and financial assistance and to assist the people of East Timor in creating an enabling environment for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .

Concerning Myanmars cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , it had in October received an ILO technical cooperation mission and , with its advice , it had adopted the necessary administrative , executive and legislative measures to ensure that there could be no instances of forced labour in the country .  Those measures should completely do away with any apprehension the international community might have that laws inherited from the British colonial Government might be applied so as to facilitate forced labour in the territory of Myanmar .  
As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
When he addressed the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , the Minister of Justice stated that the President of Equatorial Guinea was prepared to take the initiative to appoint a high-level team from his Government to meet with the Office of the High Commissioner in order to negotiate point by point a comprehensive programme of technical assistance , pursuant to Commission resolution 1999 / 19 of the year before .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
The representative of France , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed through extrabudgetary resources .  
He was gratified that , despite many difficulties over the years , this work had matured into a fully operational programme of technical assistance activities , growing out of a solid base of research and analytical expertise .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reiterated the importance attached by his Group to the question of the financing of experts in UNCTAD expert meetings and the need for funding in that respect .  The participation of experts from developing countries enhanced the complementarity between technical cooperation and analytical and deliberative work and helped in integrating these activities , as called for by UNCTAD X .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
For the Meeting the UNCTAD secretariat had prepared an issues note that identified and described six broad areas of HCMs : information provision and technical assistance ; financial support ; fiscal incentives ; investment insurance ; investment-related trade measures influencing the volume , sectoral composition and geographical distribution of FDI in host countries through market access preferences and export promotion devices ; and measures geared specifically to the facilitation of transfer of technology .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
The work of the Conference was organized around three technical committees , established to deal with a range of specific issues pertinent to cartography , surveying , land management , GIS technology and spatial data infrastructure in support of sustainable development , as defined by an agenda item of the Conference .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 8 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient financial resources will be made available for maintaining adequate technical infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive of the Oversight Support Unit efforts and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of recommendations of the external oversight bodies .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
With regard to contingent-owned equipment , additional requirements of $ 2,784,600 were attributable to the reservation of funds for the anticipated settlement of claims , pending completion of the technical and administrative review , for equipment losses sustained by several contingents as a result of hostile action .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
Of the 38 replies received , one , from a Member State , reported having appointed a focal point for international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and 9 respondents ( 24 per cent ) , 8 of which were Member States , indicated that they did use the instrument distributed by the Centre .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported conducting a wide range of activities aimed at strengthening human rights in the administration of justice , noting that further information was contained in a forthcoming analytical report of the High Commissioner to the Commission of Human Rights on the implementation of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 104 ) .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Few recipient countries have established effective focal coordination points for technical cooperation and the few that have done so have only been partially successful in moderating the competing interests of various ministries , departments and non-governmental agencies , many of which often compete for the same resources from the same limited pool of international technical assistance donors and providers .  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism .  
For example , half of the respondents considered that a summary of each report should be provided well in advance of meetings and that Secretariat briefings should be organized on key reports , highlighting their policy implications and clarifying technical concepts .  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Urges the international community , including regional organizations , to undertake a greater and more determined financial and technical cooperation effort to support and promote alternative development projects , drawn up as part of national programmes , on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility as a pillar of international cooperation in countering the world drug problem ;  
They are determined to eliminate forthwith restrictions other than those related to customs , together with administrative , technical , financial , monetary and quantitative restrictions , and to reduce progressively , as agreed , all charges and taxes and treat Arab commodities as national commodities in the wider sense .  
In view of the increasing functions assigned to the technical body in the General Secretariat , they entrust the Secretary-General , together with the Economic and Social Council , with the task of supporting and developing that body with a view to triggering the Arab mechanisms and institutions responsible for following up joint Arab economic action .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
The Special Fund had been established by the Assembly in its resolution 1240 ( XIII ) of 14 October 1958 to provide , inter alia , systematic and sustained assistance in fields essential to the integrated technical , economic and social development of the less developed countries .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
In line with those objectives , the Department provides timely and qualitative organizational and technical support to the General Assembly , its General , First , Special Political and Decolonization ( Fourth ) , Second and Third Committees and its various subsidiary organs , to the Economic and Social Council and most of its subsidiary and ad hoc bodies and to United Nations conferences dealing with disarmament , international security and economic , social and related matters .  
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management . 
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
How to continue to benefit from the technical and logistical advantages of ad hoc groupings and limited representation forums , while ensuring that decisions with global repercussions are taken in forums that are more inclusive and that have clearly defined and broad-based intergovernmental mandates , such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the Development Committee and the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council ?  What would be the most appropriate form for an enhanced institutional relationship between WTO and the United Nations ?  
The view was expressed that technical interoperability , while it constituted a desirable objective , should not be regarded as a theoretical prerequisite for cross-border use of electronic signatures .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purpose of preparing a version of the revised draft elements of responsible crime prevention2 and proposing priorities for international action , including areas for technical assistance , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
There are several short - and medium-term measures developing countries should consider for profiting from enhanced production and export opportunities : ( i ) awareness-raising ; ( ii ) research and market studies ; ( iii ) facilitating certification and reducing its costs ; ( iv ) developing national standards ; ( v ) developing local markets ; and ( vi ) providing appropriate governmental and technical support .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 2 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Agencies will thus provide their technical expertise according to their respective mandates following the themes of the round tables : HIV / AIDS prevention and care ; HIV / AIDS and human rights ; the social and economic impact of the epidemic and the strengthening of national capacities to combat HIV / AIDS ; and international funding and cooperation to address the challenges of the AIDS epidemic .  
The objectives of the workshop were to provide information on the occurrence , technical parameters , economic interest and potential resources contained in mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules , to identify existing institutional factors that have contributed to the discovery of such resources and continuing research on them and to provide information which would assist in drafting rules , regulations and procedures for prospecting and exploration for these mineral deposits , in particular deep sea polymetallic sulphide deposits and cobalt crusts .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 7 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Encourages the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions , to document and disseminate innovative and successful practices of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , including triangular cooperation arrangements and those supported by the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
The report notes significant progress in implementing the new directions strategy , especially in areas such as the strategic orientation of TCDC activities , advancing TCDC through pivotal countries , new developments in triangular cooperation , sharing knowledge and experiences and the integration of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
Their main assets are committed , resourceful and talented staff , a strong field presence and the combination of normative , analytical and technical cooperation functions under one roof .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
I encourage the Security Council to consider innovative mechanisms , such as establishing a subsidiary organ , an ad hoc informal working group or other informal technical arrangement to discuss prevention cases on a continuing basis , particularly with regard to periodic regional or subregional reports that I intend to submit to the Council , as well as other early warning or prevention cases brought to its attention by Members States .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
The PBC had also expressed concern at the negative growth in the operational budget and the reduction of major programmes C and D . Those issues were related : the main reason for the reduction of major programmes C and D was the lower level of technical cooperation delivery expected during 2002-2003 .

Since Qiulitage is geologically characterized by brittle and weeping rocks and great susceptibility to cave-ins , the project managing department of the 15th Engineering Bureau of China Railway Construction Corp that was contracted to undertake construction adopted technical strategies such low-impact explosion , short length drilling and steel bolstering .  More than 26,000 cubic meters of rock were drilled and cleared before this long distance tunnel 3.9 meters wide at the bottom and 3.6 meters in height was finally completed .  
Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
During the " eighth five-year plan " period ( 1991 - 1995 ) , China 's opening up to the outside world is moving forward with unprecedented speed .  The national economy is broadening its participation wider range of international delegation and international exchange ; economic and technical cooperation and exchange between China and overseas has already infiltrated into every aspect of China 's economic life .  A " wide open " environment has begun to take shape in the whole country .  
For a future period of time , China will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in new agricultural technology , comprehensive development of land resources , and such basic industries and pillar industries as water conservation , energy , transportation , important raw materials , machinery and electronics , mining , etc . and will encourage foreign businessmen to employ new high level technology to participate in the technical transformation of China 's enterprises  
A large number of technical and new type managerial and administrative talent was trained , the transformation of the enterprise 's operational mechanism and the reorganization of assets were accelerated and a lot of modern famous brands such as Shanghai Bell , Shanghai Volkswagen , Konka , TCL , etc . were formed . 
Their advanced apparatus and equipment , highly level scientific and technical staff and comprehensive dominance in scientific research have made important contributions to the promotion of construction of national key projects and the development of academic disciplines .  
This is because the compilation and publication that comes out of the ISI 's citation indexing database is aimed at providing services for scientific and technical information , and the items cited do not all directly affect the concrete substance of articles ; so as a type of statistical analysis product , the influence itself of the data does not have an academic evaluative content and should not be deemed the authoritative data for evaluating academic publications .  
To address the objective reality of China 's scientific and technical journals , the scientific funding magazine department of the National Commission for Natural Sciences Funding , in April 1999 organized and convened an international symposium on " Raising the Overall Quality of China 's Scientific and Technical Periodicals " .  The scientists and personages from publishing circles who participated in the symposium concluded for the most part that in the future , the development of China 's scientific and technical magazines most certainly must follow " planned birth , " with the focus on raising quality .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
and put the ideological and political education in the primary position of quality education .  It is imperative to promote the integration of the students ' moral , intellectual , physical , aesthetic , and labor technical education with social practice ;  
the people of the whole country have expressed an ardent wish to build a prosperous nation through science and education and a strong country through knowledge ; the whole country 's industrial and agricultural structures have been undergoing major readjustment ; the enterprises have been engaged in technical innovation ;  
It is necessary to propel forward the scientific and technological revolution of agriculture , reform the agricultural scientific and technological structure , and gradually establish an agricultural scientific and technological innovative system which can attain the advanced level in the world , a technical dissemination system which can transform scientific and technological achievements in a highly efficient and productive way , and an agricultural educational and training system which can noticeably enhance the scientific , technological , and cultural quality of peasants .  
Facing the contradiction that has appeared , between periodic and structural surplus versus a domestic market potential that is a long way from being realized , and facing the contradiction that while market demand for a large quantity of commodities is insufficient , we still rely on imports for some special products , especially key technical equipment , we must be determined to solve some outstanding problems such as irrational economic structure .  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
However , entry into the international market was not something that could be accomplished in one move .  To reach the technical standards for product quality in various countries , China 's household electrical appliance enterprises persisted in producing high-quality products in compliance with internationalized standards to obtain international certification under the system of product quality assurance by numerous exporting countries , thus completing the first step they must take in entering the international market , securing the " pass " to the international market , and opening up an international passageway .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
To make static targets moveable , the task force engaged in tackling major technical hurdles worked without a letup for several months , made do with whatever was available , and thus succeeded in developing movable false tanks , false armored cars , and other false targets .  
During the Kosovo war , in view of NATO 's technical superiority in space and aerial reconnaisance , the Yugoslav People 's Army used the strategy of concealing the genuine and displaying the false and breaking up the whole into parts ; they hid their tanks in the woods and set up dummy targets all over the place and also arranged heat and electromagnetic sources around them , to lure and deceive the enemy reconnaisance system into being fooled . 
Just before the battle the training emphasized technical and tactical training for individual soldiers and small sections , and importance was also attached to coordination between different branches and joint training of major units ; at the same time the topography and weather conditions of the training areas were as far as possible similar to those of the target area .  
Third , to have the right of contributing to industrial development .  As the technical and safety standards are formulated by ourselves , they will contribute to the industrial development of the broadcast and television network , pager , cellular phone , electronic notebook , computer , public screen , and household electrical appliances , among other things .  
It is an immediate and urgent task for our country 's inspection and quarantine departments to make rational use of technical means , effectively safeguard the interests of the state and domestic industries , actively break down the technical barriers set by developed country and help domestic enterprises adapt themselves unceasingly to WTO regulations and the trend of international technological development and open up the international market .  
Leaders at all levels should study hard more new and high-tech knowledge to improve their scientific and technical qualifications , should conduct deep and satisfactory investigation and studies and modestly listen to opinions from experts and personnel involved in science and technology .  Leaders at all levels should always be in a clear-minded state , always direct the army in the right direction of the troop training and carry out the training project in a deep and consistent manner .  
As of date , the unit has established medical , transportation , ordnance , maintenance , telecommunications , and other groups to engage in supporting campaigns and studying methods of operations .  It has exerted great efforts to tackle the most difficult scientific and technical problems and decided on more than 10 topics of study .  The 30-plus theses it published have attracted the attention of academic departments and higher-level administrative departments .  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
However , since the goals were not clear and the standards were not clear , the understanding of " computerization and informationization " led to an emphasis on hardware , while taking software lightly ; an emphasis on single units , while taking networking lightly ; and an emphasis on development and redundant construction projects .  Shortcomings occurred where systems construction was not complete ; technical systems were not compatible ; and non unified standards increased daily .  
To ensure uniformity with the task of preparing for a military struggle , informationization should be matched with the technical level of troop equipment .  The aim of informationization development of China 's army must keep the world military development in large reference , based on the possible developments in future warfare , particularly the possible operational opponents that might be faced .  We must find exact positions in accordance with the integration of the required and possible , evaluating whether they fit with the highest criteria of future war for integration .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
We should strengthen the collection and accumulation of all kinds of operational data , not only collecting complete information on our side , but even more clarifying of detailed reference data and indicators on our operational opponent , particularly on the foremost opponent 's technical equipment , operational theory , battlefield geographical circumstance , and important operational targets .  
Because , as internal disputes are getting white hot and technical and political defects of the NMD program are being exposed daily , the US . Government 's confidence in this program is dropping lower and lower .  
By 2010 , military specialized technical cadres competent for both military and civilian services should basically be trained mainly by regular schools of higher learning , and a proper number of graduates from regular schools of higher learning should be selected to fill command posts , so that the knowledge structure and scientific and cultural levels of military cadres can be improved fundamentally and a military personnel training system compatible with China 's national conditions and our army 's characteristics can take shape .  
and should conduct emergency repair-oriented professional or technical training and comprehensive simulated training so as to strengthen our capability of handling an emergency situation or conducting an emergency repair under the complex , difficult , or dangerous conditions during a war and ensure that certain economic targets , which are damaged to a certain extent , will be quickly repaired and restored to normal operation in a timely fashion , thus reducing damages and avoiding further damages .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
After a certain number of years ' efforts , the army 's technical cadres with specialties of both military and civilian applicability will be cultivated mainly through regular higher education , some outstanding regular college graduates will fill the commander 's position of the army 's grass-roots units , and around 40 percent of the army 's annual cadre replenishment will be those trained through regular higher education .  
At 10:20 , the command center received from higher levels " an order of recruiting specialized technical soldiers and scientific and technological equipment to support the front " .

Sufficient advances in these industries predicate the production of a high quality doll . Ts'ui Chung , advisor to the Taiwan Toy Manufacturers Association , points out that Taiwan 's supporting industries , benefited by technical experience accumulated over the past thirty years , are unmatched by those of any other advancing nation . Taiwan 's chief competitor in the toy line is Hong Kong .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
Ancient China was known as " the land of impeccable attire , " and its culture was always closely tied to the high technical level of its textile crafts . Its silk fabrics , for instance , were treasured commodities among people in other countries , and the Silk Road became a symbol of cultural interchange between East and West . At home its precious textiles spurred the development of the art of embroidery .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
Today seven teams with 29 members are active in 12 farming areas . Their agenda includes experimental cultivation of crops such as maize , paddy rice and sorghum ; soil and weather surveys to establish the suitability of crops ; hydrological and topographical surveys to establish data for irrigation and drainage projects ; and social surveys to learn more about the farming population 's willingness to work and their technical level .  
In other words , the elderly lack a sense of security about the future and do n't want to wait idly for death , so they need another stage on which to play out the remainder of their lives . " Hsieh Tseng Fang-lan believes services of this kind have a promising future , and the response from outside has been most gratifying . The manpower bank has yet to be officially registered but enquiries are pouring in , with a need for services ranging from technical advisers for refrigeration and air-conditioning to electricity meter readers .  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
The complexity of the engineering for Three Gorges has enabled the two sides to produce vast amounts of technical material on flood prevention , electrical power generation , transport , economic efficiency , water supply , siltation , and similar subjects . There are even cases of mainland engineers being labelled as " rightist " and having their whole families dragged down with them just because they opposed the project .  
" It 's a very technical issue , " explains jade expert Na Chi-liang . The objects of art from every era have their own special characteristics . The gods and animal face patterns of Liangzhu art is similar to the Taotie , a legendary beast often seen in statues of the Shang and Chou dynasties . But upon a more precise comparison , the beast faces of Liangzhu works appear more rustic and simple ; they purvey a feeling of fierceness .  
Steering clear of collision " High educational background does n't equal high-level talent , " Chang Pei-chi says . Only a fter along time did he figure out that the high-level personnel cried out for by entrepreneurs are actually " outstanding higher-level technical personnel capable of leadership and rich in experience . " This is worlds apart from the garden variety nerd who has just earned his diploma but completely lacks practical experience .  
Fourteen years ago , at the age of 17 , Chen Yi-tsung had just graduated from an architecture course at a technical senior high school . As luck would have it , he found a job at Han-kwang architects ' office - - the first architectural practice within the ROC to carry out restoration of ancient monuments and to incorporate the spirit of traditional architecture in modern buildings .  
There are no breakdowns to show the numbers going for language study as opposed to an undergraduate , master 's or doctoral degree , but Yuan has observed that most are going to enroll in undergraduate programs . In particular , many students at technical junior colleges go to Australia for a university degree , and in deciding to go they usually consider the question of immigration . This may happen as well in other major targets for Taiwanese emigration , such as New Zealand and Canada .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
This time the main technical challenge was one of climate : Taiwan 's wet , sub-tropical climate differs vastly from the alternately humid and dry , cold and hot climate of southern Australia . But at least it has continual moisture , which does n't do as much damage as punctuated moisture .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
While evaluating plans for ROCSAT-2 , the group decided that because synchronous satellites are vastly more complex than low-orbit satellites , and because it would be difficult to redirect the technical and human resources which were being built up through the ROCSAT-1 project , ROCSAT-2 would be redesignated as a low-orbit satellite .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
And although these kind of knowledge can be recorded in books , such books are difficult to understand and in the end , it is " technicians " who are key . In a how-to manual on industrial espionage , chapter one might mention that if a company wants to protect itself , it must be very careful with high-level technical people it has hired away from other companies .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces . Commenting on the recent spate of scandals within the military , Assistant Professor Sung Hsiao-yuan comments : " The likelihood of corruption increases in direct proportion to the degree to which an organization is closed . The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
Having realized the meaning of " through learning you increase [ the mass of your knowledge ] day by day ; but by following the Way you diminish [ your sophistry ] day by day , " Ma Shu-li tells his students that today , with everything oriented towards technical development , understanding of life and the mind and soul has not advanced commensurately , so that when faced with social issues most people do not know how to approach them intellectually .  
It required " a grade one vocational qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a junior college of that time ] and a grade two academic qualification [ equivalent to a degree from a three-year technical high school of that time ] . Preparing for the test was difficult . Days were hard after you went to work too , both in the training period and when you actually were working . If you did n't have an interest in machinery , it would have been hard to take any pleasure in the work , " says Cheng .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
In Taiwan , the Ministry of Economic Affairs ' Department of Industrial Technology , whose main mission is to support the development of industrial applications for new technologies , set up a major R &amp; D program at the Industrial Technology Research Institute ( ITRI ) to develop products making practical use of high-temperature superconductors . The island 's leading electrical wiring and cable manufacturers were the industrial partners for technical cooperation under the program .  
Western imperialism left a legacy of imbalance in the use of the world 's resources . Poorer nations , pressed by rapid population growth and the desire to develop , and lacking sufficient management or technical skills , usually rejected calls from the wealthy countries to put the environment first .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
Although the government has now decided to move in the direction of liberalization , the numerous " technical issues " that remain continue to make difficult any easing of the current political impasse . Proposals to allow " three links , " to permit Taiwanese firms to invest in semiconductor or upstream petrochemicals production in China , to allow Chinese capital and workers into Taiwan , and even to establish a free port that would make it easier to bring semi-finished goods from China to Taiwan for processing , still remain just that : proposals .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
Stanley Yen complained that once the tourism industry finally got a school established to train professional chefs , the structure of Taiwan 's tertiary education system changed and many technical junior colleges were redesignated as four-year colleges . As a result , the most talented graduates of the cooking school ended up teaching rather than working in food services , and Taiwan lost its opportunity to produce international-caliber chefs .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
Thanks to the experience accumulated by the ICDF and other aid groups , NGOs providing medical aid need no longer be limited to satisfying the ambition of some romantically minded individuals to do good deeds . For example , the cleft lip and cleft palate surgery program of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation ( NCF ) in Vietnam , Cambodia , the Philippines , and elsewhere includes free consultations , technical instruction , equipment donation , post-surgery speech therapy , and so on , so that medical resources are applied in a systematic manner .  
The purpose of the WHO is defined as helping people in the entire world to enjoy the highest possible standard of health . Its main responsibilities are to offer leadership and coordination on matters related to international health , to provide technical assistance , and to promote measures to prevent epidemics , regional diseases , and other illnesses . In addition , the environment , women 's issues , food safety , and global pharmaceuticals standards also fall within the purview of the WHO .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
With falling student numbers and faced with apparent apathy , technical and vocational colleges have been forced to adjust their developmental goals in order to survive , and this has thrown the entire system into crisis .  
Chang Tien-fu says : " Schools chose to focus on transforming themselves and in the process forgot their own position and character . " Although many schools did change their name , their relative position in the educational hierarchy was not improved . On the contrary , having reorganized themselves many technical and vocational schools began to turn their back on earlier achievements . In other words , they stopped focusing on the need for practical work and started to emphasize theory and R &amp; D .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Wen Shih-jen , deputy CEO of computer manufacturer Inventec , has likened the importance of cooperation between technical and vocational education and industry to laying the " last mile " in establishing the Internet : " The final section needed to ensure the Internet is linked with actual users is known as the ' last mile . ' Without this section users would be unable to get online and the Internet would be a wasted opportunity . "  
In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy . At a time when standard universities and colleges seem unsure of their own development and are establishing an increasing number of money-making , functional departments , they have begun to impinge on a market formerly considered the preserve of vocational schools . Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
Chen Chin-chin , principal of Taichung Industrial High School , feels the technical and vocational education system , an alternative to the usual route through high school and then college and sometimes referred to as the " second track , " was very difficult to set up in the first place and that it is an integral part of the nation 's wellbeing . So , how can one talk lightly about abolishing it ?  
In addition to technical and vocational students continuing on in education in large numbers and thus leading to the withering away of the " inherently " inferior " second track , " the lack of official expenditures in this area have amounted to " kicking a man when he is down , " and the gap between the two national educational " tracks " has widened significantly .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
Some people say straight out that the comprehensive high school can only attract students of middling ability . Requiring these students to study with a dual orientation and to " explore " multiple areas causes them to fall even further behind their senior high school counterparts in the general curriculum . Added to this , they are not as good as vocational high school students in technical subjects-so they end up " losing out at both ends . "  
The Ministry of Education plans call for the current seven types of vocational high schools with their 70 different courses to develop in different directions . Navigation and nursing courses , for example , will be raised to the technical college level , equivalent to higher education . Some industry sectors will be adjusted to the post-technical college level , commerce and home economics will primarily train people for the service industry , and responding to Taiwan 's entry into WTO , agricultural studies will develop in the direction of specialized agricultural education .  
After the talks , they attended a signing ceremony of the summary for the fourth session of the mixed committee of economy , trade , and technology between the governments of China and the Sudan , agreement for economic and technical cooperation , agreement for encouraging and mutual protection of investment , and other agreements  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity  
during the visit , qian exchanged views with jameel on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common interest the two sides also signed an aviation agreement and another agreement on economic and technical cooperation  
The agreement was contained in the agreed minutes of the fourth session of the joint commission on economic , trade and technical cooperation signed at the closing ceremony of the meeting here today  
Kemp and China 's Minister of Education Chen Zhili renewed earlier today a memorandum of understanding on educational and training cooperation , in which senior education , professional and technical education , far distance education are decided as priority fields for bilateral cooperation  
qian noted that since the two countries set up diplomatic relations some 20 years ago , the bilateral relations have enjoyed smooth development and that the economic and technical co operation have been fruitful  
A steering committee has been established at the Secretariat level to plan and coordinate all technical , administrative , logistical and financial aspects of the Conference , which includes representatives of all relevant offices of the Secretariat ;  
To improve this coordination at a technical level , some countries have established joint task forces of senior officials of these ministries and agencies to undertake key economic projections of the main macroeconomic variables .  
For the purposes of advisory services and technical assistance , the term " national institution " is interpreted flexibly to mean any body which is established by a Government to play a central role in the domestic human rights situation .  
The team was formed into technical working groups covering 10 major economic and social sectors and 10 intersectoral issues , and prepared a comprehensive draft Action Plan for Immediate Rehabilitation based on existing knowledge of the situation .  
ILO continued to provide technical advisory service to a number of OAU-sponsored regional and subregional institutions concerned with vocational rehabilitation and training , occupational safety and health , and migration and social security .  
The ISpMA concept can be successfully implemented by moving forward in stages and establishing a sound political , legal and technical basis for the implementation of subsequent steps .  
The Croatian Government and the public and private sector were widely represented and exchanged views with most major international financial and technical assistance bodies and financial experts from all parts of the world .  
As the century draws to a close , the world is experiencing profound changes in the ideological , political , economic , social , scientific and technical spheres .  
That is why we ask for the unfailing support and backing of the international community , which , we feel , should in the short - , medium - and long-term involve substantial , increased and strengthened technical and financial cooperation . 
The Commission stressed that the use of local logistical and technical aerial and other support would be dependent upon the prevailing situation of confidence and availability of adequate assets .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and the specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
It is , therefore , of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping .

It is , therefore , fundamental that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation are well focused and that means for coordinating such activities are studied in order to avoid overlapping actions .  
The Bank 's policy in regard to lending outside the European Union has been based on detailed economic and technical analysis of alternative solutions and the optimum size and timing of project implementation , together with their environmental impact .  
Indeed , after a long period of conservative and incremental technical change , alternative process routes for mineral production are being developed and these are emerging as economically more efficient as well as environmentally less hazardous .  
In this process , it was crucial to go beyond the limits of a technical exercise and to develop a process marked by shared ethical values where individual goals must be reconciled with global solidarity .  
The problems associated with radioactive waste management and disposal are complex and multifaceted , touching on scientific , technical , geologic , economic , social , health , environmental , political and intergenerational factors . 
Safe , acceptable management and final disposal of radioactive waste including spent fuel and waste from future decommissioning require coordination of a multiplicity of activities scientific , technical , economic , social , legal and political efforts .  
An interim multilateral fund was created to assist developing countries meet their incremental costs ( mainly technical and financial ) resulting from the adoption of substitute technologies to help them comply with the Protocol 's phaseout provisions .  
In this latter case , strategies are defined in practical terms , and development initiatives ( investment , technical assistance ) are planned on a flexible , rolling basis instead of making use of a lengthy process of complex multiyear development planning .  
They are increasingly contributing also by encouraging employees to volunteer and by providing , free of charge , their organizational talents , technical skills and physical facilities for raising funds and delivering services .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction management and supervisory tasks .  
The Commission considers it imperative that the export of radioactive wastes be inadmissible to countries that do not have the technical , economic , legal and administrative resources for environmentally safe and sound management of radioactive wastes .  
It is assumed that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
The programme has built up its operational momentum through the participation of 15 multilateral and bilateral external support agencies , and , as such , it is the largest global multiagency technical assistance programme in urban development in the world .  
It is estimated that staff at the Professional level and above would be required to perform the substantive scientific and technical tasks and the administrative tasks , as well as the executive direction , management and supervisory tasks .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
The veracity of the information is enhanced to the extent that structured technical and operational relationships are working in close , and timely , collaboration at the national , regional , and international levels ;  
Provide scientific data and training , stressing the interdisciplinary approach to problem solving in national specific issues and strengthen the development of environmental education programmes as part of basic , higher , technical and vocational education ;  
Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
It is crucial that the current complementary efforts by national and international organizations involved in mineclearing , mine awareness and education , technical assistance and assistance to the victims of mines be strengthened and accelerated ;  
MEXICO Request : In late May 1994 , the Government requested technical assistance to national observers for the elections scheduled for 21 August 1994 and , prior to the elections , the preparation of an analytical report on the Mexican electoral system .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
A complete understanding of Iraq 's technical capabilities , manufacturing equipment , precursor suppliers and past chemical weapon production activities are essential if the Commission is to be confident that it is monitoring from a solid base .  
It coordinated and monitored humanitarian assistance operations , provided technical assistance to and verified the entire electoral process , culminating in the holding of free and fair elections on 27 to 29 October 1994 .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
It is thus an important duty of the international community to promote democracy among and within States by helping them to build a democratic system ; by providing them with logistical and technical support for the organization of free elections ; by promoting the creation of a public sector to guarantee the proper management of State affairs ; and by providing the various sectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate the bases of democracy .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Jamaica 's national youth policy was therefore designed to redress all these deficiencies , but first of all to bring an integrated approach to the activities of youth organizations nation wide and to equip all youth with the necessary academic , technical and life-coping skills to foster their personal development .  
The influx of young people into the labour market has led to the emergence of acute social problems ; rapid advances in many scientific and technical areas have posed new challenges that must be faced by the education and training systems if youth unemployment is to be addressed properly and prevented from giving rise to many social ills , such as marginalization , poverty and delinquency .  
We believe that , even though States themselves are responsible for an adequate and effective level of physical protection against nuclear materials , the IAEA and other international organizations can play an important role in ensuring international cooperation , including by providing technical assistance to countries in fields other than law-enforcement .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
This is linked primarily to the absence of a clear international treaty and legal bases , procedures and documents regulating the actions and powers of the relevant international institutions and also national organizations , for securing a timely and effective reaction to emergency situations of a natural and technical origin .  
That institution will be responsible for studying data and other forms of information presented by coastal States regarding the outer limits of the continental shelf when the shelf extends beyond nautical 200 miles and for giving scientific and technical advice to States in preparation of this data when such assistance is requested .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
The Secretary-General 's report is a technical compilation of the answers received from some States , without its own input and without the views of so many competent international organizations that are daily preoccupied with current and future developments in the Balkans .  
These steps , however , constitute only a technical management of the arms race , and are insufficient : they leave the international community far short of the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons recognized by the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , in 1978 .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at providing the United Nations system , on a stand-by basis , with specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation , and , in this regard , notes with satisfaction the establishment , in particular in developing countries , of national volunteer corps ;  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Deeply concerned about the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to education , training and literacy programmes ,  
Japan appreciated the role played by the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in providing advisory services and technical and financial assistance at the request of Governments and the role played by regional human rights machinery in supporting human rights activities and programmes .  
The general objectives of protecting vulnerable groups are to ensure that all such individuals should be allowed to develop to their full potential ( including healthy physical , mental and spiritual development ) ; to ensure that young people can develop , establish and maintain healthy lives ; to allow women to perform their key role in society ; and to support indigenous people through educational , economic and technical opportunities .  
Such improvement should be based on technical cooperation activities , partnerships among the public , private and community sectors and participation in the decision-making process by community groups and special interest groups such as women , indigenous people , the elderly and the disabled .  
Governments , with the participation of the private sector , non-governmental organizations , local community groups , indigenous people , women , local government units and the public at large , should act to maintain and expand the existing vegetative cover wherever ecologically , socially and economically feasible , through technical cooperation and other forms of support .  
To effectively plan and manage water-supply and sanitation at the national , provincial , district and community level , and to utilize funds most effectively , trained professional and technical staff must be developed within each country in sufficient numbers .  
UNCTAD , when carrying out technical cooperation , should exploit its comparative advantages , ensure complementarity with the related work of other international organizations , intervene on strategic and catalytic grounds and allow for the differentiated needs of developing countries with a particular focus on the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , in accordance with the Cartegena Commitment .  
For that purpose , the Board requested the secretariat to prepare an annual report on selected technical cooperation topics , supported by comprehensive factual information on individual projects as well as on the programme as a whole ;  
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
An effective advisory service and technical assistance programme was a major concern of all those who took part in the World Conference on Human Rights , Governments , United Nations agencies and programmes , regional and national institutions and non-governmental organizations alike , and the Vienna Declaration makes such a programme one of the principal means for achieving its objectives and those of the Programme of Action .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
In 1993 , UNFPA organized a thematic evaluation of family planning services in eight countries to assess the quality of such services along six dimensions : choice of methods ; technical competence of service providers ; level of information and counselling available to clients ; nature of interpersonal relations between service providers and clients ; the presence of mechanisms within the programme to promote continued contraceptive use ; and the appropriateness and acceptability of services .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Welcoming the increased role undertaken by the United Nations system to support activities in economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and stressing the importance of continuing to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to foster international cooperation in order to address fully the wide range of issues pertaining to development and the growth of developing countries ,  
In particular , the global POPIN Coordinating Unit and the regional Population Information Networks are working towards harnessing the tremendous potential of print , audiovisual and electronic media , including databases and networks , to disseminate technical information and to promote and strengthen understanding of relationships between population , consumption , production and sustainable development .  
At the international level priority should be given to the development of a holistic and integrated framework to put in place social and economic conditions which will facilitate optimum matching of land resources with needs , in terms of production , sustainability , and conservation of biodiversity , together with the necessary technical and infrastructural support , which can be applied in any country with appropriate modifications , according to local needs and conditions .  Proposal 2 .  
The United Republic of Tanzania , which in the late 1970s and early 1980s implemented a successful technical project to stop overgrazing-induced land degradation by destocking some 120,000 head of cattle in the Kondoa district of central Tanzania , is now working on the socio-economic aspect , seeking ways to manage growing population pressure and reintroduce livestock into the farming systems of the under-utilized , formerly eroded area .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
The Commission supports international and regional networks on in situ conservation areas ; ex situ base collection under the auspices of FAO ; the organization of a fourth international technical conference on the conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources ; and the establishment of the new global information systems for plant genetic resources and seed exchange based on the ongoing Seed Information System .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
The support units seem widespread - they are responsible for developing local guidelines for national execution , training line ministries on national execution procedures , preparing the required national execution reports , facilitating contractual arrangements with cooperating and implementation agencies and generally providing support to the technical ministries hosting nationally executed programmes .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such technical advisory panel ( s ) as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Recommends for this purpose that a second technical meeting on the planning of the Decade be convened immediately prior to the thirteenth session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations , to be supported from within existing budgetary resources , and urges Governments , United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and , in particular , indigenous people 's organizations to participate actively in that meeting , in accordance with agreed procedures ;  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , in countries affected by the illicit drug problem , that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Several participants called for an increased role for UNEP 's regional offices on trade-environment issues , for greater emphasis on raising environmental understanding , awareness-building and education , and for technical analysis in such areas as prior informed consent , environmental reviews of trade policy , environmental dispute avoidance , analysis of intellectual property rights in technology transfer and international cooperation .  
If the distribution of women 's employment is considered by seven major occupation groups - professional and technical , administrative and managerial , clerical , sales , services , agriculture , and production - it can be noted that women are concentrated in clerical , services and professional and technical occupations . 
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
The project takes into account UNEP expertise for environmental law and UNDP country coordinating capacity ; all national level programmes will be implemented under the supervision of the UNDP resident representative , with UNEP acting as technical adviser .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
With rising incomes the poor should be able to afford rudimentary but satisfactory sanitation facilities with some technical advice on sewage disposal facilities from the Government , but it will remain the responsibility of the Government to provide basic health care and safe drinking water facilities to the poor wherever they are located .  
While he respected the Committee on Contributions as an independent , technical body in its sphere of competence , he noted that , because of the vague nature of the mandate given to it by the General Assembly , it had been unable to adopt a balanced political decision on the scale of assessments , as a result of which the matter had been left to the Fifth Committee .  
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
Deeply concerned by the lack of economic independence of rural women owing to their lack of access to land ownership , productive resources , and employment and entrepreneurial opportunities and owing as well to inadequate professional and technical skills as a result of the restricted access of women to training and literacy programmes ,  
It was appreciated that the report of the Secretary-General on sustainable mountain development ( E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 5 ) , in addition to technical aspects , also covered the social , economic and cultural aspects of human development in mountain areas .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
The system must therefore be reviewed and updated so that resolutions are of the highest technical quality , carry proper moral weight and have the proper deterrent effect , are carried out with the swiftness required in order to protect and compensate the victims and are respected and implemented promptly by the relevant bodies .  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In response , the Special Unit has prepared a report which contains a number of recommendations designed to promote and implement a more strategic approach to technical cooperation among developing countries in an effort to make it a dynamic instrument in support of development in the context of the changing realities of multilateral development cooperation .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
Within the framework of existing guidelines , individual technical cooperation activities under the regular programme are determined by the nature of requests received from developing countries , the recommendations of intergovernmental legislative and expert bodies , and the approved work programmes .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
The programme comprises four interrelated and mutually supportive functions : ( a ) developing statistical concepts and methods for use by Member States ; ( b ) collecting , processing and disseminating integrated statistics ; ( c ) promoting the coordination of international statistical activities ; and ( d ) supporting technical cooperation in statistics and statistical data processing , including informatics .  
The activities to be carried out in the biennium 1996-1997 under the three subprogrammes of programme 12 of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised ( A / 47 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , will emphasize assistance to developing countries in improving their development planning systems and policies in support of national development through provision of advisory services to Governments upon their request and substantive and operational support to technical cooperation projects .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
Welcomes the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ;  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
The Office provides legal advice and services in operational matters to United Nations organs , bodies and Secretariat units and is responsible for meeting the needs of Member States in dealing with legal , political , economic , scientific , technical and environmental aspects of the law of the sea and marine affairs .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Collection and evaluation of information for the development and maintenance of performance indicators ; basic data for least developed countries ; studies , analytical papers and issues notes for technical meetings , including round tables , consultative groups and the Committee on Development Planning , as well as joint publications with regional commissions and other organizations .  
( i ) Statistical profiles by subregion ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) regional compendium of environmental statistics ; ( iii ) statistical charts on thematic topics ( 2 ) ; and ( iv ) technical publications on socio-economic and environment statistics ( 2 ) ; 
Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
A coherent national policy would enhance the managerial capability on economic and technical cooperation among developing countries within government and could enable developing countries to take maximum advantage of their participation in cooperation activities and speed up the implementation of relevant decisions and programmes .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
It also suggests an approach that consists of a careful selection of specific activities within the sector , followed by interactions among developing countries on the conceptual plane in the first instance , moving on to detailed technical work involving programme / project preparation , analysis and implementation .  
Examination and recommendation to developing countries on a continuing basis , in the light of changing circumstances and emerging conditions of specific areas and capacities relating to economic cooperation among developing countries and to technical cooperation among developing countries for absorbing lessons from the success of other developing countries .  
The national committees for the Decade and related technical agencies of the industrialized countries have remained active in the respective countries and have pursued a variety of collaborative relationships with neighbouring countries , and supported disaster-reduction initiatives in developing countries .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the ILO International Training Centre have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
Empowerment in this regard might be perceived as adopting a correct ( technical / organizational ) approach , based on alternative sets of prescriptive rules developed by experts .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
The operational and administrative procedures that the ministries use to conduct their day-to-day business need to be improved , and there needs to be ( a ) a degree of decentralization of decision-making to qualified managers and technical specialists ; ( b ) a building up of a professional civil service based on merit ; ( c ) an improvement in communication flows within the ministries ; and ( d ) a procedure for record-keeping in order to establish a solid foundation for institutional memory . 
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
International economic , trade and development cooperation : As the world 's fourteenth largest trading nation and the sixth largest outbound investor , the Republic of China on Taiwan is willing to share its own development experience and achievements with the international community and has already offered to developing countries financial and technical assistance for development projects .  
Specific reimbursement rates for environmental and intensified operational use conditions would be recommended by the initial United Nations technical survey team for approval within the mission budget and revised as required by changing circumstances .  
International security must be identical for all States in all its dimensions : military and political , social and economic , scientific and technical and humanitarian .  
Among the points of discussion were the recruitment of students to central or local mine-clearance training schools ; the need for expatriate staff or technical advisers to stay on after the initial establishment of a national demining programme ; a recommendation that the United Nations provide pre-tailored material for new demining operations , including standard operating procedures , training and materials .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
The regulatory activities of the judges during the first half of 1994 , which for journalists were overly technical and which held little meaning among the general public , together with the preparatory work of the Deputy Prosecutor , which appeared dry work , were not initially helpful to the Tribunal when it came to overcoming the scepticism expressed throughout the first months of its existence .  
FAO reported that , in support of its technical advisory assistance to member countries in the field of water law and its administration , it had issued in 1994 a publication entitled " Preparing national regulations for water resources management : principles and practice " ( FAO Legislative Study Series , No . 52 ) , which consisted of a manual providing conceptual material for use in the preparation of national regulations for the management , development , use and protection of freshwater resources . 
Smaller specialized agencies have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with highly focused subsectoral issues and that operational activities should remain flexible to meet requirements in these specific technical areas .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the International Trade Centre ( ITC ) have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
Ensure universal and equal access to and completion of primary education by all children and eliminate the existing gap between girls and boys , as stipulated in article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child ; 10 / similarly , ensure equal access to secondary education by the year 2005 and equal access to higher education , including vocational and technical education , for all girls and boys , including the disadvantaged and gifted ; 
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
With the increased importance of NGOs in the United Nations system , this constituency and the scholarly community have a major role to play in channelling relevant information and research results , developing teaching materials , engaging in advocacy and sponsoring fruitful technical assistance activities , as the correctional training initiatives have recently demonstrated .  
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
At the same time , operational activities are to be expanded significantly and a solid base for technical cooperation and assistance established , to strengthen the programme 's role as a service provider , as well as an honest broker in putting prospective donors and clients in touch , promoting international exchanges , coordinating regional and interregional action , etc .  
However , since the UNDP basic needs questionnaire does not include this problem area , and countries or other entities are often unaware that this United Nations programme exists , including national planning offices charged with formalizing technical cooperation projects , its potential contribution is apt to be ignored and its inclusion in country programmes , with their competing priorities , unlikely or chancy at best .  
We believe that the formulation of this concept , including aspects of financial , material and technical support by the international community for the peace process in Liberia , requires a realistic , weighted approach based on the provisions of previous Security Council resolutions .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
It was agreed that the Committee should be flexible and simply take note of the existence of national institutions , irrespective of the political or ideological regime under which they had been established , bearing in mind that they could be improved and that technical assistance could be provided to that end .  
Although international contractual personnel were supposed to be recruited for technical and trades and crafts-related functions , a substantial number have been employed to perform administrative core functions that should have been assigned to United Nations staff members .  
NULLCooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the League of Arab States continued during 1994-1995 in technical fields of mutual interest in the areas of agriculture and rural development , natural resources and environment protection , human resources training and global economic and social development .  
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
While historic factors such as the low level of African incomes and inadequate domestic technical expertise and capacity explain a part of this situation , it is also the general perception that inappropriate macroeconomic policies , combined with an antiquated and ineffective legal , regulatory and prudential framework , have been the main impediments .  
Besides the introduction and my concluding observations , the report is divided into six sections , related to : public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative aspects .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
The experience gained over 30 years demonstrates the utility of free and unrestricted exchange of information through a dedicated global means of communication linked to individual national technical agencies .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
NULLWhile there is no comprehensive international programme for the early warning of geophysical hazards , there are some internationally acknowledged technical facilities or national agencies which collect , analyse and disseminate information regarding global seismic and volcanic events .  
Requirements were outlined in a 1992 guidance document and IAEA provides a standard basis of reference with the International Nuclear Event Scale , which allows a common understanding of nuclear events among the technical community involved , the media and the public .  
The experiences of both WMO and IAEA demonstrate that a sustained and broadly based effort , drawing on the distributed technical abilities of various institutions and national collaborators , is critical for the successful coordination of international warning systems .  
" A technical consultation on sustainable fisheries development in the area of the FAO Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission ( WECAFC ) , held at Caraballada , Venezuela , from 18 to 22 October 1993 , agreed that the conflict between industrial and artisanal fisheries continued to be a problem in the region , given the difficulties of coming up with equitable solutions .  
" In addition to international developments related to the elaboration of the 1982 Convention , FAO continued to stress , in fisheries policy and technical advice provided to its developing members , that the implementation of conservation and management measures in exclusive economic zones would be unlikely to bring sustained long-term benefits in the absence of sound , reliable and cost-effective MCS systems . 
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
NULLGovernments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training that is relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
It also continued to collaborate actively with regional organizations in Africa , and to provide extensive technical assistance for the effective management of policy reforms in many areas , including public finance , monetary policy , debt management and exchange rate management , as well as in the design of social safety nets .  
In addition , it promotes assessment , integrated development and management of water resources ; and addresses the need for planned mineral resources exploration and development and responsible land use , through training , exchange of information , technical advice and the strengthening of relevant national and regional institutions .  
Promotes regional and subregional cooperation on modalities for addressing critical issues faced by disadvantaged groups in societies undergoing rapid change , with particular consideration to technical cooperation among developing countries through the organization of national and subregional training workshops and field study-cum-seminar programmes ;  
They receive the label " untrustworthy " , which effectively bars them from engaging in professional or technical work and blocks their access to administrative posts or positions of responsibility or employment in a foreign firm , even though their qualifications and skills may make them ideal candidates for the job .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
That a key element of reform is the selection of members with the requisite technical skills and broad managerial capabilities to enable the Commission to take bold initiatives to keep pace with global trends in human resources management and the changing needs of the organizations .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training that is relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
Those areas included ensuring the continuity of remote sensing data from satellite operators , technical assistance in the implementation and operation of ground stations , price reductions and easier access to data , provision of training and education for efficient and timely data processing and analysis , and increased efforts in the coordination of programmes and projects between national , regional and international aid agencies .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Although concrete results have been reached over the past few years in improving the technical infrastructure at the Palais des Nations , the physical distribution of buildings and the relative autonomy of many Secretariat organizational units located in Geneva , made it difficult for the Electronic Services Section of the United Nations Office at Geneva to provide the increasing amount of services required .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to cooperate more closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
The management stated , in its response , that the original request for proposal dated 1 August 1990 was formulated with the objectives of ( a ) identifying a state-of-the-art access control system that would generally meet the technical and security requirements of the United Nations and ( b ) identifying prospective contractors capable of supplying such a system .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
provide a wide range of health services , which includes preventive , curative , health protection and promotion , environmental health and family health programmes , to meet the refugees ' basic needs and improve their overall state of health , with professional and technical assistance from the World Health Organization ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;

Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;

were only two solutions : one would be for the current system to be radically changed so as to incorporate the specialized agencies as major players in determining conditions of service for the staff ; the other would be to allow the staff of the specialized agencies and technical programmes to develop their own system so that they could get on with the important tasks that needed to be addressed urgently .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
conceptual framework incorporating socio-economic and gender analysis at the macro ( inter-household ) and micro ( intra-household ) level with people 's participation and conflict resolution has been developed and is being operationalized through a socio-economic and gender analysis field manual accompanied by an open-ended series of technical supplements , which will be concise , sector and subsector specific guides to utilizing the socio-economic and gender analysis paradigm .  
Its main objective is to regulate the administrative decentralization of our executive power , which , in the framework of the Republic 's unified approach , involves shifting and delegating technical and administrative functions that are not exclusive to the national executive power .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The Committee agreed with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee that it was important to have a firm scientific and technical basis for future action on the complex attributes of space debris and that the Subcommittee should focus on understanding aspects of research related to space debris , including debris measurement techniques ; mathematical modelling of the debris environment ; characterization of the space debris environment ; and measures to mitigate the risks of space debris  
They conveyed the Community 's proposal to dispatch a Ministerial Trade and Investment Mission to South Africa at a mutually convenient date in 1997 and also to establish a joint CARICOM Diplomatic Mission in South Africa in the near future to advance economic , technical and cultural relations with the countries of southern Africa and with the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
We would therefore be deeply appreciative if this understanding were translated into tangible results and if the subsequent technical discussions held following political consultations were much more fruitful .  
It is the understanding of the Government of Cape Verde that , despite the structural difficulties it faces , it is duty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peaceful international environment and a partnership of solidarity that will allow all the nations of the world to benefit from mankind 's scientific and technical achievements and to improve social management in order to guarantee each citizen internationally recognized basic rights associated with the values of freedom , democracy , development and well-being .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
Enhanced international technical assistance and advisory services can decisively strengthen national capacities and the institutional bases for supporting national plans and strategies that are designed to bring about sustained and sustainable social development .  
In the same negotiations , insistence on unilateral , non-transparent national technical means as opposed to a multilateral and transparent international monitoring system created a major obstacle for consensus .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
The report of the Secretary-General on this item ( A / 51 / 381 ) is especially helpful in that it recalls the need to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation .  
It clearly portrays the endeavours of the United Nations system in implementing General Assembly resolution 50 / 17 of 20 November 1995 , which requested the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation , as well as to continue to expand the parameters of this cooperation in response to the growing needs of our common member States . 
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
The GCOS Space Plan is aimed at the following : ( a ) defining the components of the initial operational system , based on the existing systems of various space agencies ; ( b ) outlining the scientific and technical requirements for observations of global , atmospheric , oceanic and terrestrial climate variables that may be made with space instrumentation ; and ( c ) reviewing existing and planned space agency missions for compliance with GCOS requirements , including assured continuity of the observations .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .  I should now like to turn to the other , technical draft resolution before the Council .  
Those acting at the international level have long been recognized for their contributing role in advocating for reproductive rights and reproductive health and for providing assistance to national Governments and national non-governmental organizations in technical aspects of population , family planning and reproductive health programmes .  
The Committee had played a vital role in promoting economic , social and cultural rights , by formulating final views on the way in which States had fulfilled their Covenant obligations , by defining its General Comments as a basis for jurisprudence in that area , by discussing the question of the elaboration of an optional protocol to the Covenant that would allow individuals and groups to present legal complaints with regard to the violation of one or several of the rights protected by the Covenant , and by successfully conducting its first technical assistance mission .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
To that end , the Ministry of State responsible for women 's status and problems , in cooperation with other State agencies , had undertaken the collection of gender-based statistics , developed programmes of vocational and technical education for girls and a policy of credit for women entrepreneurs , incorporated women 's human rights in the curricula of human rights education in secondary schools , launched public awareness campaigns and developed measures to eliminate violence against women .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the tenth session , as approved at the ninth session , taking fully into account the results of the ninth session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
ILO aimed , in the context of technical programmes implemented at the national level , to give women the means to play a more active economic role by organizing vocational training courses for them in areas traditionally reserved for men , by proposing various measures to develop their entrepreneurship and by organizing workshops to teach them to organize themselves better vis - - vis their employers and to negotiate better working conditions .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
Military contingents , including military , technical and rear support units ( subunits ) , shall be fully supplied with weapons and military equipment , spare parts and military and technical supplies , and technical servicing , evacuation and repair components under schedules , tables and norms specially drawn up for them , taking into account the physical and geographical conditions of the region in which their tasks are carried out and in accordance with individual agreements .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
The technical analysis , along with policy proposals reflecting a set of priorities at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels , should help in the elaboration of objectives for the rehabilitation and restructuring of the economy with a view to absorbing the surplus labour force , diversifying trade , achieving an adequate rate of growth in income and ensuring its equal distribution among regions .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The text was based on General Assembly resolution 49 / 194 , with a few new provisions incorporated in the light of the Secretary-General 's proposals contained in his report on strengthening the rule of law ( A / 50 / 653 ) , including a provision on the need to mobilize additional resources for the Centre for Human Rights and , in particular , one relating to the Centre 's programme of advisory services and technical assistance , which had a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law . 
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
Provision of adequate social services and facilities , improving and rationalizing urban planning and shelter design to cope firmly with the actual needs of communities , as well as provision of technical and other relevant assistance to the inhabitants of unplanned settlements are essential for the improvement of living conditions .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality and to assist Member States in achieving the goals of preventing crime within and among States and improving the response to crime , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46 / 152 and in line with the recommendations of the Ninth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;

In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
The low priority assigned to forestry in national development plans results in low budget allocations in comparison to needs , and is reflected in lack of technical capability , human resources , extension facilities , basic data / information , and administrative efficiency . 
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Welcoming the agreement signed on 22 September 1994 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of Burundi on the implementation of a major programme of technical assistance and advisory services in the field of human rights , the various components of which form part of preventive action supported by the international community ,  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The Office has documented numerous case-studies worldwide of management and technical changes that have led to reduced environmental impacts and improved economic performance .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
With a view to achieving these aims , it is essential to eliminate duplication and strengthen cooperation between relevant international organizations , in particular UNCTAD , WTO and the International Trade Centre UNCTAD / GATT , in order to conserve scarce resources and make full use of the existing and potential synergies among these organizations .  Among the measures that should be considered is the establishment of a technical assistance fund administered by WTO in order to help LDCs participate actively in WTO .  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions on the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance during the transition period , a process of peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building , in particular its resolutions 49 / 137 and 49 / 21 I of 19 and 20 December 1994 , respectively , which emphasize the compelling need to design a new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities established by the Governments of the region ,  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of the International Conference on Central American Refugees and in the new subregional development strategy , the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Recognizing that El Salvador is at a complex stage in the process of consolidating peace , which calls not only for the implementation of the remaining commitments under the Peace Agreement but also for a new approach involving the implementation and consolidation of medium-term and long-term national development programmes and strategies aimed at resolving the structural problems that are the cause of tension and social instability , and emphasizing the importance and necessity of international technical and financial assistance , both bilateral and multilateral ,  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
Tasks like facilitating public administration by effectively and creatively utilizing human resources ; building government processes and institutions to provide a peaceful resolution of conflict ; the need to shift non-core functions of government to the private sector ; to maintain the vitality of technical cooperation while changing the mechanisms of delivery to incorporate additional technological advances ; and to perform those tasks successfully while balancing severe resource constraints .  
At its twelfth meeting , the Group of Experts identified several high-priority areas , such as advice in policy formulation and implementation strategies , administrative restructuring for economic reform , people-oriented development , strategic fiscal and financial management , and strengthening of training in , for example , evaluation and management of change , in which Member States may seek technical help from United Nations agencies . 
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
While the main efforts for administrative improvement must be initiated and sustained at the national level , it needs to be recognized that technical cooperation with international and regional institutions , including regional United Nations agencies , will be vital in assisting and supporting the process of improvement .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
It was not really possible to develop a special legal status applicable to all the objects and systems concerned , because of their great dissimilarities ; it was more realistic to choose a legal status based on certain aspects , such as the capability of the aerospace object to travel through outer space and to remain in airspace for a certain period of time , and the technical design and nature of the object or system , for example whether it was single - or multi-staged , piloted or unpiloted , and launched vertically or horizontally .  
The Subcommittee could contribute to establishing a special legal regime to regulate the use of the geostationary orbit ; ITU regulated only the technical aspects of its utilization , while the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its subcommittees were concerned with the political and legal aspects of the peaceful uses of outer space .  
As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
The technical and professional posts remaining in the Department for Development Support and Management Services were to constitute the minimal critical mass needed to provide substantive support to overall planning and management activities in mineral resources in line with the mandate of the Department .  
In Viet Nam , a technical cooperation project was recently completed that assisted the Government in completing a new mining law , together with the implementation of regulations and a model mining agreement , and in establishing an administrative framework for the effective operation of the new legislation and the sustainable development of the mining sector .  
Just prior to the restructuring of the United Nations Secretariat in the areas of economic and social development in 1993 , UNDP , the principal funding agency for United Nations technical cooperation activities in mineral resources , revised the funding priorities and the funding mechanism by which United Nations agencies were supported in their technical cooperation activities .  
The Governing Council of UNDP , at its thirty-eighth session ( 1991 ) , adopted comprehensive legislation , in keeping with General Assembly resolution 44 / 211 on the comprehensive triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , that put forth new initiatives relating to the national execution of technical cooperation activities , and the development of projects according to an integrated and prioritized national programme , and placed renewed emphasis on human development and capacity-building in development activities .  
While the United Nations system continues to provide technical cooperation assistance and advisory services of a neutral and non-commercial nature in the field of mineral resources at the request of Member States , its ability to do so has been severely diminished owing to evolutions in the funding of technical cooperation activities , and current budgetary reductions and the financial situation in the United Nations Secretariat .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
Furthermore , the General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and expressed its appreciation for the provision of the services of two interregional advisers .  
During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The main objective of the new format of the Ninth Congress was to maximize its practical and scientific value through problem-oriented workshops , demonstrations of different approaches to facilitate technical assistance and cooperation , and special sessions devoted to the discussion of priority issues of direct interest to all countries .  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 137 on human rights in the administration of justice , called attention to such standards and norms , and recommended that the establishment of a comprehensive programme within the system of advisory services and technical assistance be considered in order to help States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures that had a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law .  
It stressed the need to assist States in the task of building and strengthening adequate structures through technical assistance to national projects in reforming penal and correctional establishments , in education and training of lawyers , judges and security forces in human rights , and in other specific spheres of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law .  
With the aim of providing high-quality technical support services to countries , some agencies have identified focal points on gender in their country teams and geographical divisions to monitor the mainstreaming of gender issues at the national and regional levels , as well as at the global level .  
As described in greater detail in the report of the Secretary-General on technical advisory services for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme ( E / CN . 15 / 1996 / 8 ) , such resources could be used for technical cooperation activities and advisory services geared towards building and supporting democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems with emphasis on the complementary relationship of justice , peace and development and the need to address them simultaneously .  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
In keeping with the options I outlined in my report to the Council of 19 January 1996 , and pursuant to resolution 1042 ( 1996 ) , I sent a technical team last month to examine the current functions of the MINURSO military component and to determine whether its size could be reduced , while still permitting it to play an effective role in monitoring the cease-fire and verifying allegations of violations . 
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
In particular , the private enterprise sector , which is the key agent of development , is not well developed in most African countries , and its growth is constrained by shortages of capital and of entrepreneurial , managerial , technical and marketing skills .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
The fifth objective is to facilitate appropriate follow-up and complementary work to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme studies and research and analysis of the economic and social impact of drug production , trafficking and consumption , as well as formulations of alternative development programmes to remedy this impact , and to provide technical assistance in the formulation of national policies to prevent and reduce the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances . 
To that end , the co-sponsors invited individuals from specific governmental agencies and private industries to attend and , in order to receive the full benefit of the programme , the co-sponsors also requested that each participating organization or company wishing to attend the Conference should send both the chief operating officer or the equivalent and the senior technical officer .  
26 Mechanisms used for accessing the resources and expertise of FLC included sharing information , exchanging personnel , finding technical assistance , using unique federal laboratory facilities and capabilities , licensing patents and technical know-how , acquiring software , performing cooperative research and development , using cooperative research and development agreements directly with private companies and other entities , working cooperatively with NASA , forming consortia and using technology developed under government contracts .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
Furthermore , while some countries apply the principle of the total programme approach and national execution to all sources / projects of technical cooperation , in most countries existing NEX development planning structures / procedures do not provide for the integration of activities other than those falling strictly within the UNDP country programme ( excluding , for example , projects executed through bilateral aid , development financing institutions , multilateral organizations , trust funds and so forth ) .  
Although at times difficult political , economic and technical problems had to be solved , common sense and the two sides ' commitment to their international obligations always won out .  
In cases where the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles , the coastal State , if it meets specific technical criteria , can establish the outer limits of the legal " continental shelf " up to 350 nautical miles from the baselines , or up to 100 nautical miles seaward of the 2,500-metre isobath , whichever is further seaward .  
The paramount task in the settlement of conflicts is the formation of a common economic area , the all-round development of trade and economic and scientific and technical cooperation , the implementation of joint projects in the field of telecommunications , construction , transport , fuel and energy and environmental protection , and the encouragement of investment and trade on the basis of the universally recognized principles of international law , bearing in mind cultural and historical ties .  
The difficulty experienced by international organizations and Governments to update their respective instruments was recognized , but it was recalled that the Recommendations have been developed and are kept up to date in the light of technical progress , the advent of new substances and articles and the exigencies of modern transport systems , and therefore there would be a risk for the Recommendations to become obsolete or not adapted to the technical progress if a four-year interval period was adopted .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
At the same time , existing modalities will be reformed and streamlined in seven ways : reduced meetings ; fewer and improved reports and revitalized publications ; new networking arrangements ; increased interactions with member States ; more effective technical support , including use of country representatives ; enhanced South-South cooperation ; and strategic alliances with partners .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .  NULL  
The project foresees technical assistance from UNCTAD , primarily in the establishment of institutional , operational and managerial capacities , and the necessary legal framework for the proper setting up and functioning of the port .  
In 1995 , in close collaboration with the Palestinian Authority , the Programme prepared the project entitled " Multi-sectoral drug control assistance to the Palestinian Authority " , which will provide technical assistance ( a ) to establish a drug control institutional framework ; ( b ) to reduce the illicit supply of narcotic drugs through improved detection , interdiction and prosecution capacities ; and ( c ) to prevent and reduce drug abuse through improved awareness , treatment and rehabilitation methods .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .  
The Special Fund was established by the General Assembly to provide new administrative and operational machinery to spearhead the enlargement of the scope of United Nations technical assistance and , in particular , to " . . . facilitate new capital investments of all types - private and public , national and international - by creating conditions which would make such investments either feasible for more effective " ( General Assembly resolution 1219 ( XII ) on the financing of economic development , dated 14 December 1957 ) .  
With regard to the progress that has been made since registration in relation to exploration , it is proposed that a workshop / seminar be convened to assess the current state of deep seabed mineral exploration with a view to determining if there are any outstanding technical issues to be overcome as well as to provide the Authority with a clear set of guidelines for work that may be expected of a contractor in a plan of work for exploration approved in the form of a contract ( stage I of the exploration plan ) . 
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
UNCTAD , in its field of competence and in collaboration with relevant regional and international organizations as well as non-governmental organizations , should be prepared to extend to island developing countries its technical cooperation capacity in respect of policies for sustainable economic development .  
Considerable international technical and financial assistance is provided by the housing cooperative movement in developed countries ; for example , for 44 years , the United States Cooperative Housing Foundation has supported projects in 90 countries , and is currently active in 30 , including major projects in South Africa and Poland . CECODHAS and ICA Housing work energetically in support of housing cooperatives in the transitional economies . 
The following narratives of ESCAP assistance to the concerned countries include : ( i ) adoption of the international standards and practices of countries with market economies , ( ii ) analytical activities , policy advice and technical assistance to the economies in transition , and ( iii ) possible ways of enhancing economic and technical cooperation among countries with economies in transition and with developing countries , in particular through cooperation with regional and subregional groupings .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
The Panel at its second session ( E / CN . 17 / 1996 / 24 ) noted that a series of issues concerning the provision of technical , technological and scientific advice on traditional knowledge , innovations and practices of forest use and conservation merited further development ( para . 88 ) , identified matters that should be addressed ( para . 89 ) and noted the need for the effective protection of indigenous rights and for the equitable sharing of benefits ( para .  NULL  
Much more information is needed regarding the actual and potential costs on various alternative routes available to the Central Asian republics as a basis for regional and national decisions on transport priorities for investment in infrastructure , technical assistance , training , better management and improved cooperative arrangements .  More precise information , available to all parties , would result in far more effective cooperation concerning rates and conditions on existing or proposed alternative routes .  
Many serious technical problems have been noted in the use of physical infrastructure , such as outdated vehicles and rolling stock , lack of repair facilities , lack of financial means to buy new vehicles , problems of break gauge , bogie change and axle load on railroads , and problems of CIS brake systems and automatic coupling ( SA-3 ) , which are not compatible with the wagons and trains of non-CIS countries .  
Indigenous people should have access to adequate financial and technical assistance , from States and through international cooperation , to pursue freely their cultural , economic , social and spiritual development and for the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized in the present Declaration .  
Welcoming also the continued efforts by States to provide humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation to the people of Haiti , Supporting fully the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti and the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in the establishment of a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the full observance of human rights and the full restoration of the constitutional democracy of Haiti , and encouraging the International Civilian Mission to continue to cooperate with the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti and others participating in institution-building , including police training activities ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Delayed publication of semi-annual financial statements ; elimination of miscellaneous supplemental schedules to the main financial statement ; elimination of preliminary unaudited financial statements for regular budget and peace-keeping budgets at the end of the biennium ; elimination of supplementary annex to technical cooperation report . ( b ) Payments and disbursements .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
The health issues included in the Platform for Action were already part of the Ninth General Programme of Work of WHO and technical programmes have continued with their activities as planned although , given current resource constraints , substantial additional funding is not anticipated .  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
" To that end , in certain subregions , coordination of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to combat illicit trafficking of drugs and precursors will be improved , taking into account national priorities and in a continuous dialogue with the competent national authorities " .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
The strategic reform of UNIDO , endorsed by member States at the General Conference of UNIDO in December 1995 , has emphasized UNIDO 's dual role as a worldwide forum for supporting and promoting industrial development , and a provider of specialized integrated technical cooperation services .  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
With financial support from Germany , preparatory work is already under way on a high-impact programme for entrepreneurship development among women , under which 10 national programmes will be elaborated , each aimed at releasing the principal technical , managerial , financial , institutional and policy constraints affecting the development of women 's entrepreneurship .  
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
Since the question of financing of technical cooperation activities supported by OIC and its subsidiary bodies is of crucial importance , particularly in view of diminishing international resources for official development assistance , the Islamic Development Bank and other funding institutions in the Islamic world should participate in periodic consultations between the United Nations and OIC . 
International strategies of cooperation and coordination are outlined in the Habitat Agenda , chapter IV , section E . The main strategic objectives and activities presented in that section cover the establishment of an international enabling environment ; issues of international finance , external debt and trade ; the promotion of the transfer of technology and exchange of information ; and the provision of support to technical and institutional cooperation .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
The Special Fund had been established by the Assembly in its resolution 1240 ( XIII ) of 14 October 1958 to provide , inter alia , " systematic and sustained assistance in fields essential to the integrated technical , economic and social development of the less developed countries " .

It has established national committees in more than 80 countries , and through its regular meetings and special seminars has played a major role in the exchange of experience and technical information on the sustainable use and conservation of water in food production .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
In respect of international cooperation and practical technical assistance , the Governments were making efforts to strengthen the rule of law through international cooperation and assistance , improving policy development , increasing the use of bilateral and multilateral agreements and promoting the establishment of integrated regional policies , programmes , plans and mechanisms to prevent crime and ensure justice .  
At its fifth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted resolution 5 / 2 , entitled " Technical cooperation and interregional advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice " , in which it reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the Programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality , as well as the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme .  
Furthermore , the Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the Programme by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandates . 
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
Governments recognized UNCTAD 's technical cooperation programme as an important element in providing practical assistance to developing countries , especially those with the greatest need , and committed themselves to strengthening its effectiveness and impact as an essential complement to the institution 's policy-oriented analytical and deliberative work .  
This situation is particularly lamentable in the light of the fact that several States parties to the Convention are in possession of the financial and technical means to enable them to establish a system of rapid alert in regions where political situations are identified as being volatile .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .

They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
Finally , the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities for the promotion of human rights ; details about these activities at the national , regional and global level are outlined in the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights ( see E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 ) .

In 1994-1995 , following the support provided in the area of health policy and planning as well as in definition of proposals for decentralized projects through bilaterals , WHO 's work focused on the following : definition of a post-war strategy for rehabilitation of the public health sector and sustained development ; definition of possible health-care financing alternative ; technical support and training of nationals in developing a health insurance scheme ; completing policy frameworks on resource allocation and urban health care ; and providing technical support in the areas of health insurance .  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
In Haiti , although there is no direct technical cooperation related to a specific project , close and regular coordination is maintained at a political level .  
The programme is thus composed of the three following major activities : promotion and implementation of the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , and rights contained in other relevant international instruments ; cooperation and coordination with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , including with the international human rights community , and the programme of technical assistance and advisory services ; and , dialogue with Governments and all other parties concerned with minority issues .  
Commit ourselves to working towards the greater use of solar energy through the provision of adequate technical assistance and funding , the full utilization of existing international funds , and the facilitation of increased participation by both public and private sectors .  
The Programme is conceived as a necessary global commitment and a major coordinated effort of the various national and international actors to develop and implement more than 300 top-priority renewable energy projects of national , regional and international value within a 10-year period in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility , economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar energy .

A sustained commitment of all relevant parts of the United Nations towards increased cooperation under the guidance of the High Commissioner , increased resources for both technical and financial assistance and continued substantive programme development are required in order to provide an effective response to the growing demand by the Member States for cooperation with the United Nations regarding the rule of law .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
The Expert Group recognized the need to create forums in which national statistical agency experts could address technical issues , and emphasized that informal ad hoc groups comprised of representatives of a small number of countries , constituted along the lines of the Voorburg Group on Service Statistics , could play an effective role in addressing such technical issues due to their greater flexibility compared to intersecretariat groups .  12 .  For each issue identified , the Expert Group reviewed ongoing research and existing coordination processes at the international level .  
The choice of the date for the elections is dependent first and foremost on the resolution of outstanding policy issues ( S / 1996 / 705 , para . 16 ) and , subsequently , on technical , procedural and support questions flowing from the agreed policy framework .  
Once these fundamental policy issues have been resolved , approximately 140 days will be required for the resolution and implementation of pending technical and support aspects , such as public information programmes , registration of voters , candidacy nomination and campaigning , staff training , data and systems verification and materials supply , to ensure that the electoral process is conducted in a fair manner .

That was due to a number of factors , including sociological attitudes which perpetuated the domination of women ; illiteracy among women ( 91 per cent of women were illiterate ) ; the fact that women 's roles , needs and responsibilities were not seriously taken into account in economic and social development policies ; the priority accorded to technical solutions to women 's problems ; and the marginalization of women in political bodies , even though women represented a vast proportion of the electorate .  
In conclusion , he urged all Parties to encourage the establishment or strengthening of national climate committees , as well as national and regional action plans for climate change , in support of the Climate Agenda , an inter-agency initiative to establish an integrated framework for international climate-related scientific and technical programmes , and reaffirmed WMO 's strong commitment to fully support the Convention and its implementation process . implemented jointly . 
The IPCC welcomed critical comments based on careful scientific and technical analyses , but many of the objections raised had already been considered in the IPCC process and rejected because of inadequate scientific bases .  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .

Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned . 
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;

Firstly , Costa Rica wishes to express its satisfaction at the initiation of the consultative process for the formulation of the medium-term plan , agreed in General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 , which , with the initiation of systematic consultations with sectoral and technical bodies of the United Nations , will allow the experts directly involved in programme implementation to give constructive expression to their views and for these views to be considered when making budgetary allocations .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
In November 1995 , the Committee approved , on an exceptional basis , taking into account prevailing humanitarian conditions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the export of 186.5-million cubic metres of natural gas per month from the Russian Federation for an initial period of two months , on condition that it would revert to the matter in the case of interruptions or delays in the delivery of natural gas to Sarajevo for other than technical reasons .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the Secretary-General 's efforts to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
The committee is currently focusing its work on a review of Liberian electoral laws and constitutional provisions ; the establishment of an independent and impartial administrative mechanism for the management of the electoral process ; the role of the international community in the holding of elections ; and the technical , logistic and financial assistance necessary to support the electoral process .  
The purpose was to provide graduates , sponsored by their Governments , with the opportunity to work in the field under the direction of senior experts or senior staff members of the United Nations in order to assist developing countries through the implementation of technical cooperation projects .  Over the course of time , a number of such associate experts have been assigned to functions carried out by offices at headquarters , usually in economic and social research and analysis ; those at headquarters offices are also sometimes referred to as " junior professional officers " .  
The status of associate experts is clearly defined : they are staff members at the junior professional level , subject to the provisions of the Charter and Staff Regulations ; they can not seek or accept instructions concerning the performance of their duties from any Government , including their own , or from any authority outside the Organization ; conditions of service are specified in a letter of appointment , under the 200 series of the Staff Rules for technical assistance project personnel , on a fixed-term appointment , generally for a period not exceeding four years .  
The principles elaborated in the above-mentioned administrative instruction on non-reimbursable loans for technical cooperation projects ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) , particularly in terms of an agreement or understanding between the United Nations and the donor and the issuance of a special service agreement with the individual , have been applied only in a limited number of cases .  
Functions assigned to gratis personnel have expanded from the traditional field of technical assistance projects to the backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( particularly in the logistics area ) and other activities such as disarmament , humanitarian assistance , mine clearance , investigation and prosecution of persons for serious violations of international humanitarian law ; more recently , functions assigned to gratis personnel have extended also to economic and social research and analysis , internal oversight services and administration and management .  
To defray costs that are involved in accepting gratis personnel , the standard practice of the United Nations is to apply the policy established for technical cooperation experts ( ST / AI / 231 / Rev . 1 ) and other contributions , and charge 13 per cent for the support services and an additional 1 per cent , if applicable , for compensation to gratis personnel in the event of injury , illness or death attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations .  
" Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .

Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
Besides the concluding observations , the main body of the present report is divided into six sections , on public security ; human rights and the judicial system ; economic and social issues ; electoral matters ; technical assistance programmes ; and administrative questions .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fishery-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized , and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fishery organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue cooperation in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .  
In fact , the much needed international humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people remains hindered by the apparent non-cooperative attitude of the Israeli authorities , who continue to enforce upon the population of today 's Palestine the same restrictive bureaucratic formalities that they designed to deal with the people living under their military occupation in previous years .

The Committee shall comprise [ government representatives ] [ persons nominated by governments , acting in their individual capacity ] who are experts [ in social , economic , legal , technical , scientific and technological , and / or environmental fields ] [ with relevant knowledge ] in the field of the Convention . [ one ] [ two ] [ three ] years based on equitable geographical distribution [ and the principle of rotation ] [ other arrangement . . . . ] .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
It seems to us that the CD , with its accumulated experience of complex disarmament negotiations on weapons of mass destruction , is the ideal forum in which to carry forward discussions on the technical and legal questions which must be confronted if we are to achieve the elimination of nuclear weapons .  
Because of a range of technical problems and the rate at which applications have been approved by the Security Council Committee , medical commodities have not reached Iraq in a coordinated or complementary manner , and most have been destined for hospitals and specialized facilities rather than primary health care centres .  
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
In its resolution 50 / 119 of 20 December 1995 , entitled Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to present to it on a biennial basis a report entitled State of South-South cooperation containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in that regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation .  
In recent experience United Nations electoral assistance has been geared more to smaller missions that provide technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned with coordinating support provided by others or to providing a symbolic United Nations presence , compared with the large missions of prior years that organized , conducted or observed the elections .  
Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
However , it is fundamentally true that the overall monitoring system could only be made comprehensive when the Council is able to conclude that Iraq 's prohibited programmes have been destroyed , removed or rendered harmless and the full extent of the level of technical development achieved in each of the prohibited programmes is known .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
The results had been reduced government expenditure , improved economic administration , a stabilized Yemeni rial , promotion of private sector activities , enactment of transparent investment and trade policies , agricultural privatization , giving priority to technical education and starting the implementation of a social security system .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
In paragraphs 20 and 21 of resolution 1997 / 66 , the Commission requested the Special Representative " to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate " and to report on these matters to the upcoming sessions of the Assembly and Commission .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
The unique advantage of UNDP in this area derives from its extensive field presence in the region , its role as a trusted and objective provider of information and advice and coordinator of United Nations system programmes , its widespread contacts with governmental and non-governmental entities , and its growing body of technical expertise in country offices .  
Taking into account the desire of both organizations to continue to cooperate closely in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and technical fields and in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic and technical development ,  
Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
The issue of human rights was of particular importance for Kuwait , because the entire population was suffering as a result of the delay by the Iraqi regime in freeing prisoners and detainees from Kuwait and elsewhere , as well as its uncooperative attitude at the meetings in Geneva of the Tripartite Commission and of its technical committee .  14 .  The human , social and psychological consequences of the Iraqi occupation continued to be felt .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
The aim of mine-action programmes , therefore , is not only technical - to survey , mark and eradicate mines - but also humanitarian and developmental - to create an environment in which people can live more safely and in which economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination . 
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Taking note also of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-first annual meeting , [ 3 ] held in New York on 26 September 1997 , in which the Ministers emphasized the increasing importance and complementarity of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries as a means of supporting and broadening the global partnership in international development cooperation ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
He agreed with the view , expressed in paragraph 21 of the Advisory Committees first report ( A / 52 / 7 ) , that an economy that resulted in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service was a false economy and that the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget were realistic and reliable .  
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
An economy that results in an unacceptable inferior product or lower standard of service is a false economy and the General Assembly must be given the technical data to assure itself that the estimates contained in the proposed programme budget are realistic and reliable .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
I must therefore underline that continued and adequate support from all member States for the Agency 's technical cooperation programme is indispensable if one is to realize the atoms for peace vision , which is the dual quest to prevent the spread of a military use of nuclear technology and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear techniques for peaceful purposes . 
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
Informal , democratic , transparent , universal , open and announced negotiations held in this official Headquarters with technical services can not be replaced by other forms of negotiations which , in lacking these elements , could only be considered complementary to them , if even that .  
Egypt also supports the initiative launched by Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia and encourages full United Nations support for this newly born initiative , in the same manner as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency supported the African States in the formulation of the Treaty of Pelindaba by assisting the Governments of the region and the Governments concerned to settle the remaining policy and technical issues , thus assisting in advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
UNDCP is assisting the Government in establishing a permanent institution at the national level responsible for raising funds and planning , coordinating , implementing and monitoring technical cooperation in alternative development projects in the country .  
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical , managerial , monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level .  
However , the political will to promote these fundamental changes is still not evident , and most of the effort remains on technical fixes related to more efficient vehicles and not on a major shift from private to public transport systems .  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
In addition , China has developed rewarding systems for young people such as the Ten Top Chinese Young People , prominent young entrepreneurs , prominent young township entrepreneurs , young technical pace-setters , young skilful workers at their posts , rural young shooting star guides , the Chinese young scientist prize and Chinese youth science and technology pioneering prizes .  
The disappointing results in the utilization of renewable energy sources are attributable mainly to a lack of information on the economic and technical viability of the technologies in small island developing States , and unaffordable prices of existing technologies , especially solar energy technology .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
The main issues that have emerged during SBSTTA sessions have been detailed technical issues , such as how to promote access to and transfer of technology , the development of monitoring systems and assessments , and issues dealing with agricultural , terrestrial , marine and coastal biodiversity and traditional knowledge .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Also in its resolution 51 / 59 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to distribute to all States the International Code of Conduct for Public Officials , annexed to that resolution , and to include it in the manual on practical measures against corruption , to be revised and expanded by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 14 , with a view to promoting its use in advisory services , training and other technical assistance activities .  
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
A typical example of the technical superiority of the traffickers has been their increased use of mobile cellular phones and faxes since the mid-1980s , once law enforcement authorities were known to be legally and technically equipped to carry out successful wire-tapping operations of the traditional phone network ( which showed improved interdiction and arrest results ) .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
The safety of space NPS at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents will be ensured by safety systems and NPS structural elements designed to meet safety requirements , and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
In Israel , the Ministry of the Environment and its organs use all administrative , technical and legal measures provided by environmental laws , and by laws dealing with general issues , such as licensing , planning and public health , to implement bilateral and multilateral treaties that Israel has signed and ratified .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
Some States observed that on a technical level , aerospace objects should not be considered as aircraft because they were designed to be spacecraft with special procedures for design , construction and launch different from those applying to aircraft , not to mention that their flexibility and capability to manoeuvre as aircraft was only incidental to their intended use .  
Others argue that environmental standards and technical regulations are different in that they comprise measures : ( i ) which are largely voluntary ; ( ii ) which may be based upon non-product related process and production methods ( PPMs ) ; ( iii ) for which channels of information dissemination are less clearly established ; and ( iv ) based on the precautionary principle . 
While the traditional approach to competitiveness discounts the external economies associated with innovation , the more recent evolutionary - neo-institutionalist school proposes innovation and technical change at the firm level as a key determinant of international competitiveness in addition to the ability to compete in delivery on the basis of prior investments .  
The main responsibility of Governments is to " provide the required budgetary resources to the educational sector , with reallocation within the educational sector to ensure increased funds for basic education " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( a ) ) and " to monitor the implementation of educational reforms and measures in relevant ministries , and establish technical assistance programmes " ( Platform for Action , para . 84 ( b ) ) .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
With regard to project activities , the Committee was informed that a reserve is maintained for each project in accordance with United Nations administrative instructions ( ST / AI / 285 ) for technical cooperation trust funds , which stipulates in Part IV , B , that " a cash reserve at the level of 15 per cent of the annual estimated expenditures " is to be maintained during the implementation of the trust fund activities to cover eventual shortfalls and will be utilized to meet the final expenditure of the trust fund , including liquidating liabilities .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
In order to foster the effective implementation of the Convention and to encourage international cooperation in the area of juvenile justice , the Committee transmits , as it may consider appropriate , to specialized agencies , UNICEF and other competent bodies any reports from States parties that contain a request , or indicate a need , for advisory services and technical assistance , along with observations and suggestions of the Committee , if any , on those requests or indications ( in accordance with article 45 ( b ) of the Convention ) .  
The country does not have the technical , physical or human resources to manufacture weapons of mass destruction , since its principal concern is to promote its economic development plan and to mitigate the adverse impact that the coercive measures imposed on our people have had on all aspects of life .  
I am convinced that integrating support for policy formulation , analytical and normative functions and relevant technical cooperation activities will serve to reinforce the necessary critical mass available at Headquarters for this indispensable aspect of the work of the Organization and the overall effectiveness of the Secretariat .  
He was convinced that integrating substantive support for policy formulation , analytical and normative functions , and relevant technical cooperation activities would serve to reinforce the necessary critical mass available at Headquarters for that indispensable aspect of the Organization 's work and the overall effectiveness of the Secretariat .  
The High Commissioner considers that the HRFOR mandate remains valid , namely , to carry out investigations into violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including possible acts of genocide ; to monitor the ongoing human rights situation , and through its presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring ; to cooperate with other international agencies to re-establish confidence and thus facilitate the rebuilding of civil society ; and to implement programmes of technical cooperation in the field of human rights , particularly in the area of the administration of justice .  
Unpaid work in the household and in agriculture , and volunteer work should be measured and valued using improved methods including regular time-use studies , and international organizations and research institutions should provide technical assistance to developing countries in valuing and making visible women 's unpaid work . 
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
Complementary efforts for the provision of technical support by a variety of national , regional and international organizations should be encouraged and coordinated in strengthening global spatial data infrastructure activities .  
A technical seminar will be organized in October l997 , supported by the Government of the Netherlands and the European Union , on the theme of " Preventing and combating the illegal employment of foreigners in selected OECD countries : effectiveness of national policies and action for cooperation at the international level " .  
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation may be seen as a complement to the monitoring activities of the human rights programme from which no Government is exempt , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
UNTMIH paved the way for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to Haiti 's long-term development , meshing security concerns with technical assistance and a whole range of environmental , agricultural , educational and administrative reform programmes .  
Noting the key role played to date by the United Nations Civilian Police , the International Civilian Mission in Haiti and United Nations Development Programme technical assistance in helping to establish a fully functioning Haitian national police force of adequate size and structure as an integral element of the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti 's system of justice and , in this context , welcoming continued progress towards professionalization of the Haitian national police and towards fulfilment of the May 1997 " Haitian national police development plan for 1997-2001 " ,  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Since those rules were of a technical nature , they did not require any further clarification ; however , Committee members were free to comment on them , either during the forthcoming discussion or in the observations of individual States , which the Commission and its Special Rapporteur awaited with interest .  16 .  Article 27 , which was the last provision of the draft articles , had been included at a late stage and the decision as to its placement in the text had been left for the second reading .  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;

Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation does not exempt any country from the monitoring activities of the human rights programme , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Among the inhibiting domestic structures and growth-constraining factors in Africa are the internal social disarticulation at almost all levels of production ; weak and undiversified production base ; economic delusion and fragmented domestic factor and product markets ; low level of endogenous human resource development and capacity utilization ; and weak physical , institutional and technical capacities .  
Requests the Chairman of the Commission to appoint a special representative with the mandate to make recommendations on how to improve the human rights situation in Rwanda , to facilitate the creation and effective functioning of an independent national human rights commission in Rwanda , and further to make recommendations on situations in which technical assistance to the Government of Rwanda in the field of human rights may be appropriate ;  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Its portrayal of these problems , however , as being such that they can not be solved through a technical process only and as requiring a major political solution is incorrect and contradicts the conclusion drawn in paragraph 46 that not much is unknown about Iraq 's proscribed capabilities .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
Recent experience has demonstrated , however , that United Nations assistance rendered in the field of electoral assistance is geared more and more to smaller missions , which give technical assistance to the electoral authorities of the Member State concerned in coordinating the electoral support provided by others , or provide a symbolic United Nations presence , rather than the large missions of prior years for which it organized and conducted ( e.g . Cambodia ) or observed ( e.g .  
This includes improved contribution to the work of those bodies on the development and updating of a wide range of international legal instruments , regulations and recommendations that provide a common technical and legal basis for the development of coherent international infrastructure networks , for the improvement of the efficiency , safety and environmental performance of the transport sector and for the facilitation of border crossing .  
As part of this , it will coordinate region-wide data collection , analysis , training and technical assistance activities designed to expand policy-relevant knowledge of ( a ) demographic processes , such as family transformation and childbearing , international migration and integration of foreigners , population ageing and changes among older people and shifts in the health status of mothers , children and other population groups ; and ( b ) interrelationships between these processes and economic and social developments . 
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In the Turks and Caicos Islands , technical cooperation has been largely aimed at direct interventions with a view to laying the basis for meaningful economic development .  In this connection , assistance was granted for the establishment of an investment agency , the creation of a national insurance scheme , and to improve customs administration and tertiary level education .  
Calls for the facilitation of access by all Non-Self-Governing Territories to relevant United Nations programmes whose objectives are the promotion of the social , educational , technical , environmental , cultural and economic well-being of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to assist in the timely progression of the process of self-determination ;  
There will be particular emphasis on strengthened planning and recruitment systems and methods , taking full account of the principle of equitable geographical distribution and gender balance ; staff learning , training and career development ; managed staff reassignment programmes ; established managerial competencies ; support to organizational and managerial reform ; improved work environment and managerial practices ; and better technical human resources management services and support to departments and offices .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
In July 1996 , an important joint letter addressed to the staff of IMF and that of UNDP on cooperation between the two organizations was signed by their two executive heads , who called on their members to collaborate more closely on new and ongoing technical assistance , country strategy notes ( when requested by Governments ) and policy framework papers and stressing the need for greater collaboration in post - and near-crisis countries and in countries engaged in programmes involving market-oriented reforms and transition .  
The importance of the national professional project personnel as the major source of expertise for technical cooperation projects has increased steadily in recent years because of their crucial advantages in transferring national private sector expertise to public institutions , using national talent that could be lost through the brain-drain and cultural compatibility with national work environment .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
We are encountering many complexities in these conditions , and these require radical organizational and institutional restructuring , vast resources and the relevant modern technologies and specialized technical know-how .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
Entitled " Putting peace to work : priorities and strategies for the development effort in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1997 " , these papers articulated a coordinated and targeted approach to the main developmental priorities , as identified by the Palestinian Authority , and included proposals from United Nations agencies and programmes for specific technical and project assistance for implementation beginning in late 1996 and 1997 .  
ESCWA has focused its activities on supporting the economic and social sectors in the occupied territories as well as monitoring their developments through the provision of advisory services and technical assistance and the preparation of reports , analytical studies and project proposals regarding the rehabilitation of the Palestinian economy .  
The consultations had provided an opportunity for agencies to present their activities and to discuss possible cooperation on , for example : joint input to the Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission and the Working Group , the provision of relevant information to be included on a website page , joint minority-related technical cooperation projects , submission of information on system-wide complaints procedures , input into the treaty bodies , dissemination of the recommendations and resolutions of supervisory bodies , and the provision of training on minority-related human rights instruments at regional and national levels .  
In his paper , Mr . Alfredsson suggested that better use should be made of international and bilateral technical cooperation programmes with a view to enhancing respect for minority rights at the domestic level ; that the Working Group should show , using concrete examples , that dialogue and technical cooperation could be effective mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution ; that the Working Group might encourage research on topics of particular relevance to its mandate and ensure that the guidelines on State reporting addressed minority concerns .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
They shall take joint actions in international financial and economic organizations with a view to ensuring appropriate funding for projects agreed on at the trilateral level , including requests to make use of the European Union 's integrated international assistance programmes , such as Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) , as well as appropriate programmes within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .  
Traditional cultural , social and religious values and practices had reinforced the lower status which society accorded to women and had restricted their opportunities for education , technical and vocational training and employment , thereby limiting their participation in the overall development process .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The progressive movement from exclusive reliance on remote monitoring by national technical means towards more cooperative and intrusive methods , including on-site inspections , is a noteworthy trend that is likely to continue with START III .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .  
The purpose of the review is to provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of the implementation of the Convention commitments ; to review , in a facilitative , non-confrontational , open and transparent manner , the information contained in the national communications ; and to ensure that the COP has accurate , consistent and relevant information at its disposal .  
Financial , material and technical assistance complemented by a favourable international economic environment was imperative for the realization of the strategic objectives set out in Beijing .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
Requests the Commission , at its seventh session , to finalize the programme for the Tenth Congress and to make its final recommendations , through the Economic and Social Council , to the General Assembly , taking into account that the Tenth Congress should deal with a limited number of precisely defined substantive topics reflecting the urgent needs of the world community and include practical technical workshops on well-focused issues related to the substantive agenda items ;  
If the Council approved his recommendations , the Secretary-General intended to dispatch a technical team to the mission area during the first half of October 1997 to reassess the resources required for the deployment of MINURSO at full strength and would revert to the Council in November , with a comprehensive report including a detailed plan , timetable and financial implications for the holding of the referendum of self-determination and fulfilment of the United Nations objectives in Western Sahara . 
Experience shows that the best results in entrepreneurial development are attained with programmes to promote and train entrepreneurs that are linked to support services with direct help to the potential entrepreneur in accessing finance , technical , managerial and marketing advice , and suitable physical facilities .  
The Meeting of the Parties shall periodically review the adequacy of the commitments of the Parties included in Annex I or acting under Article 10 , in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts , as well as relevant technical , social and economic information , with a view to achieving the objective of the Convention .  
Co-operate in developing at the national and , where appropriate , regional level , systematic observation and data archives , scientific and technical research , and support for improving endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental programmes , conferences , meetings and seminars related to the climate system , and the enhancement of access to , and exchange of , data and analyses thereof , obtained from areas beyond national jurisdiction , taking into account the particular concerns and needs of developing country Parties in implementing Article 5 of the Convention .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the full , open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific , technological , technical , socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change , and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies , including through the establishment of relevant mechanisms for this purpose in the subsidiary bodies of the Convention .  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .  In its resolution 14 ( XXXVIII ) , the Commission requested the Executive Director to indicate the relationship between mandates and budgetary allocations .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
Similarly , most UNDCP technical and financial resources for alternative development in the Andean region no longer support a wide range of isolated model projects , but rather aim at strengthening the institutional capacities of national alternative development entities and their programmes .  
By providing necessary technical inputs and advice from the earliest stages of formulation of programmes and projects , it aims at improving their quality and potential effectiveness , pinpointing areas of omission or overlap and identifying the potential for merging them with existing or planned initiatives by other organizations .  
UNDCP held two meetings , in June and October 1997 , with its regional advisers and chief technical advisers involved at the field level in key alternative development projects .  
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
A strong programme of advisory services and technical cooperation was identified by the World Conference as a major contribution to building national capacities and thus improving respect for human rights .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Both plants will be subjected , in the immediate future , to a detailed technical evaluation by the original suppliers to identify the most efficient and effective way to restore their capacity to an acceptable level of availability and reliability .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The need to set indigenous language literacy teaching within a well _ defined legal , administrative , financial and technical framework would appear to be self _ evident .  
All peoples of the world possess equal facilities for attaining the highest level in intellectual , technical , social , economic , cultural and political development .  
That concept remained valid and relevant and was likely to assume additional importance in the light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation .  
The Haitian Government counts on international and regional technical assistance to help it provide this council with modern communication methods and an effective institutional capacity and a solid information base .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Twenty-one per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 22 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .  
Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Emission reduction targets for annex I countries should be based not on purely political compromise but on objective technical and scientific criteria relating historical emissions to their measured effect in terms of global warming .  
There is a very wide range of circumstances with which NSOs are faced , reflecting profound differences in mandate , technical capacity , social priorities , legal and institutional environment and user sophistication .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .  
To serve as a permanent forum for meetings and exchanges among specialists in various disciplines and national officials responsible for the major sectors of economic , educational , cultural , scientific and technical activity ;  
One of UNESCOs major thrusts for contributing to development is directed towards renewing and diversifying technical and vocational education , so as to prepare young women and men as adults for the world of work and for responsible civic life .  
The Committee agreed with the view of ICAO , as stated in the report , regarding replacement of the aircraft , access to technical support and spare parts as required for the effective initial stage of operation , and approved the Libyan request in principle .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
Synthetic bathymetric data will be accompanied by a detailed and complete technical description of the method applied and the bathymetric measurements used to produce the cartographic and analog sources from which it stems .  
Twenty per cent of engagements were for administrative functions and 16 per cent for political , economic , social , environmental , humanitarian , advisory and technical assistance functions .

Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate , develop and enhance further the ties existing between them in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural , technical and administrative fields ,  
With a view to fostering participation of foreign companies and maximizing competition , the contracting authority may wish to cause the invitations to the preselection proceedings to be published also in a language customarily used in international trade , in a newspaper of wide international circulation or in a relevant trade publication or technical or professional journal of wide international circulation .  
Information received from a number of regional institutions indicate , however , that they are still unable to meet the technical assistance needs of small island developing States in their respective regions on account of a number of constraints , which are briefly outlined in section III below .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .

Within the Palestinian Police Force , UNHCHR has established a cadre of qualified human rights and law enforcement peer trainers and intends to work further with such trainers , through advanced training fellowships and technical assistance , to develop an institutionalized code of conduct and standing orders consistent with international human rights standards .  
The overall strategy is based on using limited UNDP core resources to launch capacity-building programmes that are subsequently sustained through bilateral donor support , and ensuring the sustainability of capacity-building programmes by matching UNDP technical and managerial expertise with the accountability and viability of local implementation partners .  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
Member States should continue to cooperate , at the national and regional levels , and with industry and through the International Telecommunication Union , to implement suitable regulations to preserve quiet frequency bands for radio astronomy and remote sensing from space ( para .  162 ) , and to develop and implement , as a matter of urgency , practicable technical solutions to reduce unwanted radio emissions and other undesirable side-effects from telecommunications satellites ;  
That the proposed Decade was both a moral imperative and an opportunity for the world community , in a spirit of global cooperation , to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to alleviate human suffering and enhance economic security ;  
The Secretary-General was also requested to create a Scientific and Technical Committee , of 20 to 25 experts selected in consultation with their Governments , to develop overall programmes to be taken into account in bilateral and multilateral cooperation for the Decade , paying attention to priorities and gaps in technical knowledge identified at the national levels ( for an assessment of the work of the Committee , see A / 54 / 132 / Add . 1E / 1999 / 80 / Add . 1 ) .  
In 1982 , the Basic People 's Congresses ( the legislative mechanism ) approved the new educational structure with a view to redesigning the educational system by introducing technical and artistic education linked with vocational training at the basic and intermediate stages , the aim being to meet the needs of the national economy for a workforce with technical and vocational qualifications .  
These included the reviews of technical assistance activities submitted to the annual meetings of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Competition Law and Policy ; analytical studies dealing with economic aspects of restrictive business practices ; practical information papers outlining the basic features of restrictive business practices ; commentaries on a possible model law on restrictive business practices ; and the reports of regional seminars organized by UNCTAD .  
To ensure that the programme is effective and sustainable in the face of increasing demands for technical assistance , a small increase in internal resources , equivalent to three man-months per year , will be needed for the specific purposes outlined in paragraph 79 above .  
The objectives of UNCTADs technical cooperation activities on competition policy have been pursued with a two-track process that encompasses ( i ) the preparation of a series of briefing papers / notes on key issues / concepts related to competition policy and its development implications ; and ( ii ) informal consensus-building activities in the form of seminars , regional symposiums and other training activities , involving numerous policy makers from developing countries .  
Potential barriers , whether cultural and organizational , political and legal , technical and programmatic or economic , needed to be identified and then removed or minimized .  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
To be effective , such a policy initiative would need to backed by funds which are additional to current aid flows , and it should be accompanied by measures in the form of technical and other assistance to ensure that national administrations are in a position to effectively undertake expenditure devoted to social purposes .  
UNCTADs work should therefore be guided by a dual effort at integration and collaboration : integration of its analytical , normative and technical cooperation work , and collaboration with other development-related international organizations , as well as with civil society and the private business sector . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
The IGE also reviewed UNCTADs technical assistance activities in developing countries and economies in transition in the course of 1998 , and , acting as a preparatory meeting for the fourth review conference , agreed on a provisional agenda for the conference , to be held in September 2000 .  
Promoting South-South cooperation , particularly in terms of economic and technical cooperation , and supporting a triangular mechanism whereby donor countries would provide [ financial / appropriate United States ] support for South-South cooperation ; considering the establishment of a generalized trust fund [ supported by voluntary contributions United States ] for triangular economic technical cooperation among developing countries .  
In view of the low level of voluntary contributions , the small proportion of the regular budget allocated to technical cooperation , and a fluctuating and inadequate operational budget , additional resources were urgently needed .  
As a multilateral organization with an impressive record of achievements in the industrialization of developing countries and with rich experience in cooperation with the donor countries and international organizations , UNIDO was well qualified to facilitate the flow of resources needed for industrial technical cooperation .  
This joint session , to be attended by senior PA officials and representatives of the donor community , would aim to present a coherent set of technical assistance activities identified by the PA and to attract the interest of potential donors to UNCTAD and UNDP proposals . 
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
As already indicated , UNCTAD proposals for technical assistance to the Palestinian people in a number of project areas remain pending owing to the constrained resource base available for delivering prompt , effective and comprehensive assistance in response to outstanding priority requests by the PA .  
As for shortcomings that still need to be addressed , difficult circumstances at the field level have constituted a major cause of interruptions , delays or otherwise hindering the smooth implementation of technical cooperation activities .  
Information and education efforts should be intensified , especially in the context of bilateral or multilateral technical cooperation programmes , with a view to ensuring respect for and proper implementation of certain existing laws which provide sufficient procedural guarantees . 
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
Training was not in principle meant to be awarded for the pursuit of academic studies leading to degrees or diplomas , but rather to give qualified persons the opportunity to extend their professional or technical knowledge and experience to areas applicable to future seabed mining and to acquaint them with advanced methods and techniques used by registered pioneer investors .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee , attended by a total of 126 States , have been marked by broad support for the draft convention , strong political commitment and the presence of sound technical expertise .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
Other areas of concern to developing countries relate to the proof of sound scientific evidence of their own sanitary and phytosanitary measures , market access restrictions resulting from pests and diseases existing elsewhere in the country concerned ( but not in the region of the exporter ) or , more generally , the potential trade and / or economic impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers applied against their exports .

While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
The new approach stresses the need for better integrated ( or comprehensive ) technical cooperation programmes , regular dialogue with key stakeholders in the countries , especially those in the private sector , and stronger partnership among United Nations agencies and donor agencies to promote private sector-led industrial development and good corporate governance through interactive policy formulation and implementation .  
Member States are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights , to enable the Office to further extend its activities in support of Member States that request assistance in establishing national institutions and also to support such institutions in their work .

A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) acts with its partners in the international community to assist in meeting the operational challenges of migration , advance understanding of migration issues , encourage social and economic development through migration , and uphold the human dignity and well-being of migrants .

As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Widespread concern was expressed that an enhanced electronic signature would be considered as if it were a distinct legal concept , rather than just a description of a collection of technical criteria , the use of which made a method of signing particularly reliable .  
Moreover , the special combination of inputs technical assistance and emergency supplies on the one hand and materials for construction and water equipment on the other ( benefiting approximately 110,000 people ) has made possible the implementation of an integrated emergency and rehabilitation programme whose overall objective is to facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition from emergency to development , through effective and direct involvement of the beneficiaries themselves . 
A critical task was joint determination of critical milestones for conceptual designs , for delivery of content by the concerned substantive specialists , for coordination with the concerned technical services and for systematic feedback on design options from beta testers representative of the specialized constituencies for the global social development programme of the United Nations .  
Decisions to recommend projects for support are considered by interdisciplinary review entities , at substantive , administrative and financial levels , and are based on the technical quality of the proposal , its relationship to national policies and the contribution that project results are expected to make to the further equalization of opportunities by , for and with persons with disabilities .  
The third characteristic that contributes to the unique value proposition of the Voluntary Fund is its focus on initiatives that contribute to an architecture of the possibilities of human beings . 40 As noted above , a number of Voluntary Fund-supported initiatives have focused on building leadership , and managerial or technical skills and have thereby empowered persons with disabilities to plan , negotiate and implement practical action .  
Fourth , the United Nations Development Programme must prepare studies on industrial projects for manufacturing basic commodities agricultural and mineral where Africa again would contribute raw materials and human resources , and the international investment firms would provide financing and technical know-how in a fair manner applied to all .

Requests the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to continue to cooperate in their common search for solutions to global problems , such as questions relating to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights , social and economic development and technical cooperation ;  
If it proved possible to reach agreement on a basic text by the twenty-third executive session of the Board in mid-December , then the Conference could be devoted to a major reflection on the experience of development with a view to identifying clear priorities for trade and development based on a practical approach involving such elements as human resource development and technical cooperation .  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize adequate technical assistance and funding and to utilize fully existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
In that regard , foreign direct investment , technical assistance for national capacity-building and export outlets were but a few of the indispensable conditions for the participation of the South in world trade .  Vigorous and sustainable economic growth , which could greatly foster employment and poverty eradication efforts , was vital .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;

The administrative and technical structure of primary health care has been developed at the central and local levels in such a way as to constitute an integrated system conducive to the promotion of development through collaboration among all the sectors concerned with health and development .  
All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
Scientific and technical progress is never used for purposes that are incompatible with the enjoyment of any human rights , including every individual 's right to life , health , liberty of person and privacy .

Moreover , accusations have been based on highly questionable expert reports , such as autopsies failing to meet technical requirements or ballistic tests performed on manipulated evidence , as in the Xamn case , or superfluous procedures , such as the ballistic test performed on hogs in the same case .  
As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
All training activities carried out under the OHCHR technical cooperation programme continue to include sessions on the human rights of women , with a specific focus on concerns relevant to each professional group addressed by the training - judges , police officers , members of non-governmental organizations , government officials , military , peacekeeping personnel , human rights monitors and others .  
In 1992 , the member countries signed the Maastricht Treaty , agreeing to eliminate over 280 physical , technical , and fiscal barriers to the creation of a single market , and moved one step closer to the final stage of currency union .  
The Commission examined the issue in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , and reported its conclusions to the Assembly in its annual reports for those years . 4 The responses of the Commission were based on extensive consultations and studies in the context of which it had sought advice from ACPAQ , its expert technical body on post adjustment , and the views of a legal consultant and several legal experts , the Legal Counsel of the United Nations and the legal advisers of the organizations . 
The Commission continues to believe that the existence of a national border in close proximity to the duty station makes Geneva a distinct situation which justifies the current post adjustment system , which was tailored to reflect that difference ; the legal , administrative , and technical difficulties associated with any of the above-described changes to the current arrangement militate strongly against implementation of those changes .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
Norway fully supports the cooperation between the OIC and the United Nations in their common search for solutions to global problems related to international peace and security , disarmament , self-determination , decolonization , fundamental human rights and economic , social and technical development .

However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
Recognizing the importance of a sound economy to social and political stability , the European Union will continue its considerable economic and technical assistance to the Palestinians with a view to contributing to a more secure and prosperous future for them in the next millennium .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
We have acquired impressive scientific , technical and industrial potential and expertise in the area of mine clearance which could be put to use in future international programmes in this sphere .  
The first stage was mine removal associated with the demarcation of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border , which , under mutual agreement with Ecuador , was performed with national resources and the supplementary technical and financial support of four friendly countries : Canada , Spain , the United States and Japan , to whom we reaffirm our gratitude for their swift and favourable acceptance of our requests for assistance . 
Due to the magnitude of the problem and the climatic and geographic characteristics of mined zones , we believe that this stage can be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the Ottawa Convention only if we can gain access to technical and financial cooperation and to logistical support given by other States parties to the Ottawa Convention , non-governmental organizations and international organizations that are committed to the cause of achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines .  
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
India is vitally interested in peace , development and stability in the Middle East , a region close to our heart and with which we share bonds of history and culture , reinforced in modern times through multifaceted cooperation encompassing trade , investment , cultural exchanges , technical assistance and human resource development .

Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;

Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties .

The apparent economic and technical obsolescence of a major part of the fleet is necessarily reflected in higher operating costs , as repair and maintenance rapidly increase with age , schedule delays and unreliability , and greater environmental risks associated with obsolete vessels .  
While the Government of Ethiopia is encouraged by the results achieved and is committed to continuing the demining programme , it is recognized at the same time that much remains to be done to get rid of all the landmines scattered in various parts of the country , and that this immense task can not be completed without international support in the form of technical and financial assistance .  
Based on previous experience , member States closely involved in the preparations have worked hard to create a lean and efficient secretariat , which will be staffed by highly qualified professionals and will build on existing experience and technical expertise .  
It was difficult to believe that while Governments and international organizations were spending vast sums of money on bilateral and international law reform programmes , the training and legislative technical assistance programme of the United Nations body dealing specifically with international trade law was being funded from limited extrabudgetary resources in the form of special contributions by a very few Governments .  
Many mercenaries who are experts in the use of explosives and technical devices with destructive material effects are hired to commit deadly attacks that cause collective fear and dread or , in other words , indiscriminate terror .  
Generally speaking , these approaches and ideas have been put forward in the various countries in which UNIAPRAVIs ideas have become established.They have been disseminated through three main channels : firstly , through international meetings organized , promoted or attended by UNIAPRAVI ; secondly , through documents and publications prepared by UNIAPRAVI ; and , thirdly , through the provision of technical assistance and advice requested by members .

While highlighting the primary responsibility of national Governments for the development and promotion of SMEs , representatives from developing countries emphasized the critical need for appropriate support and assistance from the international community , particularly through the UNCTAD technical assistance programmes which were relevant to enterprise development .  
Since then , the international community had started to devote more attention to the main policy , regulatory , legal , economic and technical issues underlying electronic commerce .

Despite the economic war waged against Cuba for nearly four decades , the position achieved by women in society , their cultural , technical and professional level , their high rates of economic , political and social participation , and the radical changes in their attitudes and lives were significant indicators of social progress .  
Concerning Myanmars cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , it had in October received an ILO technical cooperation mission and , with its advice , it had adopted the necessary administrative , executive and legislative measures to ensure that there could be no instances of forced labour in the country .  Those measures should completely do away with any apprehension the international community might have that laws inherited from the British colonial Government might be applied so as to facilitate forced labour in the territory of Myanmar .  
As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
When he addressed the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , the Minister of Justice stated that the President of Equatorial Guinea was prepared to take the initiative to appoint a high-level team from his Government to meet with the Office of the High Commissioner in order to negotiate point by point a comprehensive programme of technical assistance , pursuant to Commission resolution 1999 / 19 of the year before .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
The representative of France , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed through extrabudgetary resources .  
He was gratified that , despite many difficulties over the years , this work had matured into a fully operational programme of technical assistance activities , growing out of a solid base of research and analytical expertise .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reiterated the importance attached by his Group to the question of the financing of experts in UNCTAD expert meetings and the need for funding in that respect .  The participation of experts from developing countries enhanced the complementarity between technical cooperation and analytical and deliberative work and helped in integrating these activities , as called for by UNCTAD X .  
The Missions administrative and technical personnel , military security detachment and logistical support services were required to support the liquidation of MONUA , in particular , in connection with the protracted negotiations with the Government of Angola regarding the disposition of the substantial amount of surplus assets not required by other peacekeeping operations and subsequently handed over to the Government in April 2000 in accordance with the contract of sale concluded in March 2000 .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
For the Meeting the UNCTAD secretariat had prepared an issues note that identified and described six broad areas of HCMs : information provision and technical assistance ; financial support ; fiscal incentives ; investment insurance ; investment-related trade measures influencing the volume , sectoral composition and geographical distribution of FDI in host countries through market access preferences and export promotion devices ; and measures geared specifically to the facilitation of transfer of technology .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .  
The work of the Conference was organized around three technical committees , established to deal with a range of specific issues pertinent to cartography , surveying , land management , GIS technology and spatial data infrastructure in support of sustainable development , as defined by an agenda item of the Conference .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The measures provided for under subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of the present decree do not apply to supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian or protective purposes , related technical assistance or training approved in advance by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 ( 1999 ) or to protective clothing , including flak jackets and military helmets imported into Afghanistan by United Nations personnel , representatives of the media and the staff of humanitarian organizations for their personal use only .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 8 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient financial resources will be made available for maintaining adequate technical infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive of the Oversight Support Unit efforts and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of recommendations of the external oversight bodies .  
The provisional expansion of UNOMSIL was supported by additional resources utilized for the deployment of military observers and additional international civilian staff in the fields of political and civil affairs and human rights , as well as for the necessary administrative , technical and logistical support services .  
While UNAMSIL took over the substantive civilian and military components of UNOMSIL , as well as its assets , the significant expansion of the Mission necessitated commensurate strengthening of its civilian staffing establishment , logistical and technical support structures , the provision of additional communications , electronic data-processing and other equipment , acquisition of vehicles and contracting additional air assets .  
With regard to contingent-owned equipment , additional requirements of $ 2,784,600 were attributable to the reservation of funds for the anticipated settlement of claims , pending completion of the technical and administrative review , for equipment losses sustained by several contingents as a result of hostile action .  
Owing to the development on the ground during the reporting period , additional resources were utilized under the other official travel budget line item to support intensive political negotiations and consultations , especially in the aftermath of the breakout of hostilities in May 2000 , as well as for the travel to the mission area of the United Nations assessment team , military planning , political , public information , administrative , technical and logistical personnel and stress counsellors to provide counselling to the United Nations military personnel released from detention .  
Of the 38 replies received , one , from a Member State , reported having appointed a focal point for international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and 9 respondents ( 24 per cent ) , 8 of which were Member States , indicated that they did use the instrument distributed by the Centre .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported conducting a wide range of activities aimed at strengthening human rights in the administration of justice , noting that further information was contained in a forthcoming analytical report of the High Commissioner to the Commission of Human Rights on the implementation of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 104 ) .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Few recipient countries have established effective focal coordination points for technical cooperation and the few that have done so have only been partially successful in moderating the competing interests of various ministries , departments and non-governmental agencies , many of which often compete for the same resources from the same limited pool of international technical assistance donors and providers .  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism .  
For example , half of the respondents considered that a summary of each report should be provided well in advance of meetings and that Secretariat briefings should be organized on key reports , highlighting their policy implications and clarifying technical concepts .  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
This will generally require basic policies relating to areas such as the balance between public - and private-sector control of such technologies , cooperation with other countries in technical and legal matters and the balance between the application of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression and privacy rights and the effective regulation of the technologies to maximize the benefits derived from them .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Urges the international community , including regional organizations , to undertake a greater and more determined financial and technical cooperation effort to support and promote alternative development projects , drawn up as part of national programmes , on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility as a pillar of international cooperation in countering the world drug problem ;  
They are determined to eliminate forthwith restrictions other than those related to customs , together with administrative , technical , financial , monetary and quantitative restrictions , and to reduce progressively , as agreed , all charges and taxes and treat Arab commodities as national commodities in the wider sense .  
In view of the increasing functions assigned to the technical body in the General Secretariat , they entrust the Secretary-General , together with the Economic and Social Council , with the task of supporting and developing that body with a view to triggering the Arab mechanisms and institutions responsible for following up joint Arab economic action .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
The Special Fund had been established by the Assembly in its resolution 1240 ( XIII ) of 14 October 1958 to provide , inter alia , systematic and sustained assistance in fields essential to the integrated technical , economic and social development of the less developed countries .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
In line with those objectives , the Department provides timely and qualitative organizational and technical support to the General Assembly , its General , First , Special Political and Decolonization ( Fourth ) , Second and Third Committees and its various subsidiary organs , to the Economic and Social Council and most of its subsidiary and ad hoc bodies and to United Nations conferences dealing with disarmament , international security and economic , social and related matters .  
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management . 
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
There is a substantial decrease in the anticipated level of extrabudgetary resources owing to the reduced level of funding from the traditional funding agencies ( UNDP and UNFPA ) for country project activities , the reduced level of involvement by the Department in the execution of a large electricity network rehabilitation project and decreased response to requests for bilateral and multilateral donor funding for technical cooperation activities , except in the area of public administration ( subprogramme 8 ) , where there is an expected increase due to commitments that have been made to the Department .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
While noting the work undertaken by ITU relating to the scientific and technical aspects of the utilization of the geostationary orbit , some delegations expressed the view that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee continued to be the competent bodies to discuss the legal and political aspects of the geostationary orbit .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
How to continue to benefit from the technical and logistical advantages of ad hoc groupings and limited representation forums , while ensuring that decisions with global repercussions are taken in forums that are more inclusive and that have clearly defined and broad-based intergovernmental mandates , such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the Development Committee and the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council ?  What would be the most appropriate form for an enhanced institutional relationship between WTO and the United Nations ?  
The view was expressed that technical interoperability , while it constituted a desirable objective , should not be regarded as a theoretical prerequisite for cross-border use of electronic signatures .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purpose of preparing a version of the revised draft elements of responsible crime prevention2 and proposing priorities for international action , including areas for technical assistance , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
There are several short - and medium-term measures developing countries should consider for profiting from enhanced production and export opportunities : ( i ) awareness-raising ; ( ii ) research and market studies ; ( iii ) facilitating certification and reducing its costs ; ( iv ) developing national standards ; ( v ) developing local markets ; and ( vi ) providing appropriate governmental and technical support .  
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 2 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Agencies will thus provide their technical expertise according to their respective mandates following the themes of the round tables : HIV / AIDS prevention and care ; HIV / AIDS and human rights ; the social and economic impact of the epidemic and the strengthening of national capacities to combat HIV / AIDS ; and international funding and cooperation to address the challenges of the AIDS epidemic .  
The objectives of the workshop were to provide information on the occurrence , technical parameters , economic interest and potential resources contained in mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules , to identify existing institutional factors that have contributed to the discovery of such resources and continuing research on them and to provide information which would assist in drafting rules , regulations and procedures for prospecting and exploration for these mineral deposits , in particular deep sea polymetallic sulphide deposits and cobalt crusts .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
Requests the Secretary-General to convene , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation for the purposes of further revising the draft elements of responsible crime prevention , 7 with a view to arriving at a version of the draft elements on which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session will be able to reach consensus , and of proposing priority areas for international action , including the identification of technical assistance issues , to promote effective community-based crime prevention ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Encourages the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions , to document and disseminate innovative and successful practices of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , including triangular cooperation arrangements and those supported by the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
The report notes significant progress in implementing the new directions strategy , especially in areas such as the strategic orientation of TCDC activities , advancing TCDC through pivotal countries , new developments in triangular cooperation , sharing knowledge and experiences and the integration of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
Their main assets are committed , resourceful and talented staff , a strong field presence and the combination of normative , analytical and technical cooperation functions under one roof .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
I encourage the Security Council to consider innovative mechanisms , such as establishing a subsidiary organ , an ad hoc informal working group or other informal technical arrangement to discuss prevention cases on a continuing basis , particularly with regard to periodic regional or subregional reports that I intend to submit to the Council , as well as other early warning or prevention cases brought to its attention by Members States .  
Examples of this include improving support for democratic principles such as a fair role for the opposition , equitable access to public media , security sector reform , promoting tolerance and respect for human rights and providing technical assistance for the constitution and national institutions .  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
The PBC had also expressed concern at the negative growth in the operational budget and the reduction of major programmes C and D . Those issues were related : the main reason for the reduction of major programmes C and D was the lower level of technical cooperation delivery expected during 2002-2003 . 
The Group was convinced that , in the current situation of limited financial resources , UNIDO should continue to enhance its potential for technical cooperation in environment-related activities by strengthening existing working relationships with other international organizations such as GEF and the Montreal Protocol .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
Urges developed country Parties to provide technical and financial assistance , as appropriate , through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative programmes to support the efforts of the Parties in implementing the programmes and measures identified in the annexed framework and to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention ;  
This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on government actions , such as fair trade policies , removal of technical , legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer , sound economic policy , regulatory frameworks and transparency , all of which create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer .  
It was noted that the implementation of UR Agreements had not visibly improved their countries market access opportunities largely due to : high trade barriers remaining in the developed country markets ; increasing stringency of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical standards and erosion of preferential tariff margins , be it actual or the threat thereof .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
As per the respective Commission on Human Rights resolutions , Member States of the United Nations are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions should strengthen their support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop borders post , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
Some of the countrys partners having expressed a desire to re-establish their cooperation programmes , the various sectoral programmes prepared with the financial and technical support of United Nations specialized agencies will serve as support documents for resource mobilization and / or dialogue meetings ( consultative groups , round tables , sectoral and thematic consultations ) as needed .  
Development partners agreed to support least developed countries efforts to increase public and private investment , and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , and provide technical support for geologic mapping and compilation of basic data on local mineral potential , product adaptation and market studies for small - and medium-scale mines , as well as acquisition of new technologies .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
Responsibilities would include providing Intranet access to all peacekeeping missions ; designing and enhancing the Intranet to facilitate the sharing of sensitive information among restricted groups ; coordinating with field offices , installing hardware and software as required and provide ongoing technical support to servers , firewalls and related components of the infrastructure dedicated to the Intranet ;  
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
The new Services will appropriately reflect the level of responsibilities of each of the Service chiefs , who act as the principal advisers to senior management within the Department and also support field operations on all technical and logistics support issues within their respective areas of responsibility for some 30 peacekeeping missions and independent political offices appointed by the Secretary-General .  
These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
It was a simple request for participation in the work of the United Nations by a State with impressive economic achievements and an exemplary human rights record , which had made laudable efforts in the field of national and economic assistance and technical cooperation .  
The representative of Belgium , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;
