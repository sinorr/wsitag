Particularly since the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , the region has taken the initiative in launching offensive and sought both a permanent cure and a temporary solution to the separatist problem .  The in-depth anti-separatist struggle in the political , ideological , educational , and cultural fields has dealt a crashing blow to all kinds of separatist activities , reversed the passive situation , and retaken the initiative .  As a result , basic stability of Tibet 's social and political situation has been maintained for a fairly long period .

Japanese militarists described Taiwan and the northeast of our country as Japan 's lifeline and considered the entire Korean Peninsula as their permanent colony .  They included all of Asia in Japan 's sphere of influence .  Those false reasoning and fallacies have long been discarded in the garbage can of history .  
Nevertheless , how can such a country - - a country that has yet to liquidate its aggressive history and make official apologies and compensations to the aggression-inflicted countries and whose political leaders , including the prime minister , have from time to time tried to " call back the dead souls " of its militarists , denied or beautified its aggression , and continued to hurt the feeling of the countries and peoples concerned - - be qualified to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council ?  
Because Japanese society widely considers that neighboring countries all have requests and think that Japanese economic aid and science and technology are critical to many developing Asian nations , therefore even if people have been " offended " on the historical issue , this is of no significance and will not hinder Japan from becoming an " international country , " to the point of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council .

Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent .

Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality .

In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan .

When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
The amendments also relax the rules for granting permanent residency to the foreign spouses and children of Taiwan-resident ROC citizens . The basic requirement of five years ' continuous residency is unchanged , but the alternative requirement of being resident in Taiwan for 183 days in eight of the last 15 years is reduced to 183 days in five of the last ten years .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland .

"  
as a permanent member of the U N security council , li said , china has worked positively to preserve world peace and stability , promote political settlement of international and regional disputes , push ahead the process of world disarmament and advance the common development of all countries  
It is recognized that now that there are no allied forces or enemy States in the meaning of Article 53 , continued permanent membership in the Council is irrelevant , outdated and probably undemocratic .

Revision of the existing system , which would allow , inter alia , for automatic updating of the scale , with permanent members of the Security Council paying a uniform fixed premium on their regular budget contributions , economically less developed countries benefiting from that surcharge in proportion to their per capita income and economically more developed countries paying the same percentage as towards the regular budget ;  
The European Union , as it has already stated on previous occasions , particularly in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations , attaches the greatest political importance to the need to find a solution to the Organization 's financial crisis in order to establish a solid , permanent financial base for the Organization , thus enabling the United Nations to carry out all the mandates entrusted to it .  
Thus , despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country , there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war will be rectified , leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala .  
Keep peacemaking as proposed clearly in its basic tradition , the peaceful settlement of disputes , as foreseen in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations , in contrast to peace enforcement , which is perceived as a projection of provisional measures as defined in Chapter VII , Article 40 , of the Charter in respect to breaches of the peace and acts of aggression , but where both proposals are distinct permanent mechanisms to meet new challenges of the times .  
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers . 
The single , modest , intention of our document was to sound a warning concerning the profound collateral effects on the entire United Nations system of the possible expansion of the number of permanent members .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .

Another representative also expressed her preference for a permanent body working on a full-time basis , given the nature , complexity and specific activities of the Court as well as the increasing number of cases that might come under its jurisdiction , but nevertheless supported a more flexible solution , bearing in mind the possible economic and practical difficulties involved .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
Other objectives reached have been : the establishment and regular functioning of bilateral working mechanisms with the Government and URNG ; the signing of agreements on security arrangements with each of the parties ; the establishment of close relations with the competent State organs in the area of human rights ; and permanent , flexible contacts with other human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations .

" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee , confirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council that had withdrawn from the Committee in 1989 would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee , and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
An equitable and balanced expansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council , coupled with reforms in its working methods and procedures , would render the Council more responsive and relevant to prevailing geopolitical realities and more open to the participation of small and medium-sized States , which constitute the majority of the Organization .

Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
An important area of activity of the Chair shall be the progressive development of a nationwide system of permanent education for democracy and peace through human rights , including the elaboration of special educational programmes for members of such services as the army , the police , penitentiary personnel , the teaching profession , public administration , the judiciary , etc .  
The parties to those negotiations had agreed that permanent status issues should be covered at a later stage of the political process and they had recognized that some issues were so complex and sensitive that an interim period was needed before dealing with them . 
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
This makes us hopeful that the Assembly will be able to do so as a permanent part of its daily work , not having to deal with tragic events such as these , but in a healthy and natural way playing its role as the universal , supreme and sovereign organ of the United Nations .  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
In this regard , I am pleased to note that my country enjoys excellent , long-standing diplomatic relations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement , whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an expression of steadfastness in our convictions and in continued political cooperation . 
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .  
The present momentum for the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal should not be lost , but should be matched by commensurate political will to ensure that the work is completed in time for a conference in 1998 .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
We note with interest that Germany , a nation widely regarded as a potential direct beneficiary of an increase in permanent membership , put forward the idea that new permanent members should not be eternal but subject to periodic review with a 15-year interval in the form of a General Assembly vote .  
It is inconceivable that , in an era when the virtues of democracy and good governance at the national level are being preached , such democracy is not applied at the level of the United Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member States is not represented in the Security Council in the permanent category .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Israel ought to have realized and accepted the fundamental truth that the key to its long-term security is not through the permanent occupation of neighbouring territories and the maintenance of a hawkish attitude towards its neighbours , but through the forging of a political compact with these neighbours .  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
Take note of the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } position that three elements ( permanent core capacity ; variable capacity to support ongoing missions and additional capacity to support the liquidation of completed missions ) are essential to the effective coverage of backstopping functions at Headquarters ; that the core capacity should be funded from the regular budget ; and that the variable and additional capacity should be funded from the support account ( paras .  NULL  
Reiterating the urgent need for all concerned in Burundi , including extremists inside and outside the country , to make concerted efforts to defuse the present crisis and to commit themselves to a dialogue aimed at establishing a permanent political settlement and the creation of conditions conducive to national reconciliation ,  
In view of the pattern of meetings and conference-servicing requirements in 1994-1995 , it is expected that any requirements of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that can not be absorbed from within permanent capacity would require an additional appropriation and could not be met from within the reduced budgeted resources for temporary assistance in the approved programme budget for 1996-1997 .  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;  
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
To ensure that the proper mix of permanent , temporary and contractual staff and adequate technological resources are available so that documentation produced in all six official languages is of high quality and is issued in a timely fashion , in strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the various bodies and organs of the United Nations ;  
In the course of the active dialogue , it was suggested that such informal meetings as consultations with permanent missions scheduled by the substantive secretariats prior to sessions of intergovernmental bodies , which are serviced on an " as available " basis , should be coordinated sufficiently in advance with the Interpretation and Meetings Service to ensure that , whenever possible , the same room , staff and interpretation resources were used on a particular day . 
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
It urges you to intervene with the Government of the United States of America with a view to halting and preventing any repetition of hostile acts in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law that are being committed by a State that is a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State of the United Nations whose sovereignty , security and territorial integrity are thereby threatened and whose civilian population is thereby left in a state of alarm .  
The concept of national forest programmes should be considered as iterative and in permanent evolution in order to be fully efficient and adapted to changing economic , social and political situations .  
We urge them to find without delay the appropriate political mechanisms to make it possible to find a satisfactory solution to the crisis , with the understanding that only a broad and permanent political settlement providing for how the Government will be shared between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority can constitute the key element for establishing peace and harmony between Burundians , putting Burundi back on the path towards democracy and making possible international cooperation for reconstruction , development and the stability of the country .  
A permanent and independent electoral commission responsible for the conduct of elections would be an indispensable component of a neutral political environment in which parties , candidates and the public have maximum faith in the integrity of the electoral process .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
The national and regional development work-sites , which in times of economic difficulty and in the absence of any sustained creation of productive , stable and permanent jobs , as well as in periods of drought , constitute supplementary employment programmes . 
In addition , comprehensive media support , based on permanent cooperation with the mass media ( national radio and television services , regional radio services , press ) has been developed and gradually strengthened by :  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
The main reason for the unregulated status of hundreds of thousands of permanent residents of Latvia and Estonia of non-Latvian and non-Estonian origin is the legislation of those countries on the basis of which those persons have arbitrarily been deprived of their citizenship and have been declared to be aliens in their own countries of residence whose fundamental political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights are thus being curtailed .  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
For this reason , if a proportion is to be set based on existing types of appointments - despite the fact that the distinction between " career " and " fixed-term " appointments has disappeared to a large degree - it would appear preferable to do so on the basis of " career " appointments , which traditionally include probationary , permanent and indefinite appointments , rather than on the basis of the " fixed-term appointment " label , which covers a wide variety of disparate situations and purposes .  
As is now the case for permanent appointments , the career track appointments would be subject to termination for abolition of post , reduction of staff , on health grounds , for failure to meet the requisite level of performance and for disciplinary reasons . 10 With respect to performance , the new performance appraisal system will allow for a full annual review which would render redundant the review now conducted at the end of the first five years of service under a permanent appointment . 
Israel must fully implement its bilateral and international legal obligations , including , primarily , ending the construction and expansion of settlements , a complete and unconditional withdrawal from the city of Hebron , the release of Palestinian prisoners , and engaging in earnest negotiations in the permanent status talks with the Palestinian Authority in order to find a final and just solution to the question of Palestine .  
MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan , which has become a basic strategic principle of its foreign policy , is the most acceptable approach for Turkmenistan in pursuing its national interests and is in keeping with the country 's historical , geopolitical and ethno-cultural realities .  
In the past year , Turkmenistan adopted a constitutional law on permanent neutrality and a declaration on the international obligations of neutral Turkmenistan in the field of human rights , and set up a national institute for democracy and human rights , which received the support and approval of State and public organizations in various countries .  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
Secondly , it would require education for solidarity , in order to ensure , as a fundamental prerequisite for collective harmony , the permanent integration of our peoples on a solid basis of personal and national self-esteem , an education in which the principle of shared responsibility is increasingly strengthened in the minds and hearts of citizens .  
Central importance should be assigned to employment in the formulation and implementation of economic and social policies , with the understanding that the public sector , private sector , cooperatives and civil society have a shared interest in and responsibility for employment , and that the achievement of full employment should be a permanent goal for all of them .  
Specifically , this has included activities such as moving people to safe havens and providing assistance upon their arrival , arranging for medical treatment abroad for those wounded and unable to obtain it in situ , and facilitating third-country resettlement on either a temporary or permanent basis .  
Non-governmental organizations provide a wide variety of services to help orient and settle new arrivals , including temporary housing , interpretation , accompanying individuals to governmental agencies , guidance in seeking employment and permanent housing , orienting family members to public and commercial services such as schools and stores , etc .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
At the informal consultations held on 15 January 1997 at a briefing by UNDCP for permanent missions to the United Nations ( Vienna ) , there was agreement that the bureau of the special segment ( preparatory body ) should be distinct from that of the regular segment ( functional commission ) and should remain in office until the special session .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
The participants stressed their role in the development and future of human settlements and announced the establishment of a permanent coordinating structure , to be known as the World Association of Cities and Local Authorities Coordination , to coordinate their partnership with the United Nations system and with other international agencies .  
Both recurrent and non-recurrent statistical publications of the Statistics Division are distributed , free of charge , to permanent missions , foreign ministries and other official recipients on mailing lists maintained by the Office of Conference Services of the Secretariat and to national and international statistical offices and United Nations agencies and others who assist the Division in data collection or analysis , on mailing lists maintained by the Division .

A framework is thus taking shape of " permanent and persistent violations " of the economic , social and cultural rights of a substantial and increasing majority of the world 's population , threatening the solidarity of international humanitarian principles and human rights .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
The Working Group decided that at its sixteenth session it would focus on the questions of the membership , participation in and mandate of a possible permanent forum , including issues such as equitable geographical distribution on the basis of where indigenous peoples live and the open and authentic representation of indigenous nations , peoples , organizations and communities .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
At the eleventh summit of Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group , held in Asunci \ x { 93ee } , Paraguay , in August this year , our leaders agreed that the elimination of extreme poverty , the achievement of social justice , the promotion of forms of citizen participation , as well as the improvement of standards of living and the general welfare of our peoples are permanent objectives for our countries and can be more easily achieved through cooperation and coordination between democratic Governments .  
The very fact that the most diametrically opposed positions have used contradictory numerical estimates makes us think that these calculations could change if applied one by one to all the separate paragraphs and subparagraphs of the groups or clusters that a joint decision would contain that is , on the questions of permanent members , non-permanent members , rotation , discrimination , the veto , procedural matters , working methods and so forth . 
The thirty-third ordinary summit of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , held in Harare in June this year , underscored the pressing need for democratizing the United Nations Security Council and stressed that the process should take full account of the position of Africa as the largest continental grouping at the United Nations as far as the allocation of permanent and non-permanent seats in the reformed Council is concerned .

Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .

Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
Also , because meetings are not scheduled in Vienna throughout the year and permanent capacity is not fully utilized , and in view of the possible introduction of remote interpretation , it is proposed to maintain permanent interpretation capacity at the minimum level consistent with required language combinations .

Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .

Full-time permanent staff of HA are entitled to basic salary , monthly cash allowance , and other fringe benefits ( such as provident fund , annual leave , free medical outpatient and hospitalisation benefits and home loan interest subsidy ) while part-time staff are entitled to basic salary and other statutory benefits , including provident fund .  
We are committed to maintaining a small but responsive and accountable government , and a permanent , meritocratic , professional , politically neutral and clean civil service . "  
Under the Inland Revenue Ordinance , there are certain conditions for electing Personal Assessment . These conditions include the taxpayer electing Personal Assessment must be aged 18 years or more , he must be a permanent or temporary resident of Hong Kong , and , in case of married couples not living apart , both must enter into the election if they both have income to be included and both are eligible to elect , etc .  
He said : " The figure shows that disciplined grade staff who have joined the civil service on or after June 1 , 2000 have progressively been transferred to permanent terms upon the completion of a three-year probationary period provided they could achieve continued satisfactory conduct and efficient performance of work and maintain continued physical fitness .  
Unless otherwise specified in CEPA , a " natural person " means a Hong Kong permanent resident , whereas a " juridical person " means any legal entity duly constituted or otherwise organised under the applicable laws of Hong Kong and which has engaged in substantive business operations in Hong Kong for three to five years .  
A draft Vocational Training Law completed by the Ministry of Interior to cope with the national economic and social developments is a start . Its aim is to obtain more skilled laborers , to provide full employment and to set up a permanent vocational training system . The vocational training program is being given top priority in the Six-Year Economic Development Plan .  
She instilled a fresh , lively , open and progressive atmosphere in the primary school during her eight-year stay . When , in 1955 , the then Minister of Education , Chang Chi-yun , decided to set up a permanent Elementary School Teachers ' In-Service Education Center to raise the standard of primary school teachers , Dorothy Kao was invited to take charge of the planning work .  
Originating as country farmhouses alongside tire hot springs , rustic chicken restaurants may look spartan but they offer spiritual re lease for the permanent city dweller , added to which their " free-range chicken " signs seem to offer the tempting opportunity to enjoy a rare pleasure at little cost .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
For example , traditionally most museums have had permanent collections built around a specific theme . But very often their artifacts are far removed from their places of origin , cutting off their connection to their original environment , thereby obscuring much of their contextual meaning .  
Genetic engineering appears to be infinitely profitable and omnipotent . However , it is worth noting that gene transfer has risks : transferred genes can spread to unintended hosts , they can not be retracted , and they become permanent . If there is a problem , it could very well be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle .  
They are convinced that humanitarian assistance is necessary and should be permanent . Some even suggested that service in agricultural assistance teams be allowed to substitute for compulsory military service , so that even more young people from Taiwan can participate in international humanitarian assistance . Let 's go back for a moment to August 22nd .  
The construction budget for the new terminal at CKS Airport , which opened in July , included a public art allocation of NT $ 100 million . Deciding how to handle this huge sum proved a difficult task for the project 's executive committee . Many people questioned whether public art has to be limited to the installation of permanent " works of art . "  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan . Both ruling and opposition parties agreed that the issue was worthy of prompt attention , and later President Chen Shui-bian and interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien also publicly expressed their support .  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
The amendments also relax the rules for granting permanent residency to the foreign spouses and children of Taiwan-resident ROC citizens . The basic requirement of five years ' continuous residency is unchanged , but the alternative requirement of being resident in Taiwan for 183 days in eight of the last 15 years is reduced to 183 days in five of the last ten years .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
as a permanent member of the U N security council , li said , china has worked positively to preserve world peace and stability , promote political settlement of international and regional disputes , push ahead the process of world disarmament and advance the common development of all countries  
It is recognized that now that there are no allied forces or enemy States in the meaning of Article 53 , continued permanent membership in the Council is irrelevant , outdated and probably undemocratic .  
The end of the cold war , the emerging enhanced role of the United Nations and the prevailing political climate of conciliation create an ideal environment for an effective effort to achieve permanent solutions to long-standing problems .  
An equal , independent and impartial justice can be ensured only by a permanent court composed of magistrates elected in order to try , with full awareness and in conformity with general and impersonal legal norms , the cases referred to them .  
Throughout the very delicate transitional period that is leading towards permanent peace , public opinion which should have been influenced by a specific , national , coherent message has been abandoned in Somalia .  
UNHCR undertakes special programmes to protect women and children from sexual violence , abduction , military recruitment , irregular adoption and other forms of threatening and humiliating treatment that may lead to permanent trauma and social breakdown .  
The raising of awareness about indigenous peoples must be seen not as the task of a Year but as part of the ongoing and permanent process of education and public information about human rights and the urgent need to protect and strengthen cultural diversity .  
Revision of the existing system , which would allow , inter alia , for automatic updating of the scale , with permanent members of the Security Council paying a uniform fixed premium on their regular budget contributions , economically less developed countries benefiting from that surcharge in proportion to their per capita income and economically more developed countries paying the same percentage as towards the regular budget ;  
The European Union , as it has already stated on previous occasions , particularly in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations , attaches the greatest political importance to the need to find a solution to the Organization 's financial crisis in order to establish a solid , permanent financial base for the Organization , thus enabling the United Nations to carry out all the mandates entrusted to it .  
Thus , despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country , there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war will be rectified , leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala .  
Keep peacemaking as proposed clearly in its basic tradition , the peaceful settlement of disputes , as foreseen in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations , in contrast to peace enforcement , which is perceived as a projection of provisional measures as defined in Chapter VII , Article 40 , of the Charter in respect to breaches of the peace and acts of aggression , but where both proposals are distinct permanent mechanisms to meet new challenges of the times .  
We are also of the view that additional permanent members should be chosen on the basis , not only of equitable geographical representation , but also of such objective criteria as the political , economic and demographic weight of a country , its capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and its commitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in permanent membership .  
Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers . 
The single , modest , intention of our document was to sound a warning concerning the profound collateral effects on the entire United Nations system of the possible expansion of the number of permanent members .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
As we see it , a gradual and permanent expansion of contacts , primarily in the economic field and in environmental protection , scientific research , the transfer of technology , culture , education and tourism , could also bring about substantial changes in the qualitative content of the political dialogue .  
Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Chaguaramas , signed at Chaguaramas , Trinidad and Tobago , on 4 July 1973 , 1 / which established the Caribbean Community , created a permanent body for intraregional cooperation , consultation and coordination in order to enhance economic , social and cultural development , including the optimum utilization of available human resources for sustainable development ,  
We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
Another representative also expressed her preference for a permanent body working on a full-time basis , given the nature , complexity and specific activities of the Court as well as the increasing number of cases that might come under its jurisdiction , but nevertheless supported a more flexible solution , bearing in mind the possible economic and practical difficulties involved .  
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
Other objectives reached have been : the establishment and regular functioning of bilateral working mechanisms with the Government and URNG ; the signing of agreements on security arrangements with each of the parties ; the establishment of close relations with the competent State organs in the area of human rights ; and permanent , flexible contacts with other human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations .  
" that the amount of financial indebtedness resulting from non-compliance with contractual obligations of certain missions accredited to the United Nations has increased to alarming proportions " , reminded " all permanent missions to the United Nations , their personnel and Secretariat personnel of their responsibilities to meet such obligations " , and expressed " the hope that the efforts undertaken by the Committee , in consultation with all concerned , will lead to a solution of this problem " . 
A permanent international criminal court has been eagerly awaited by human rights advocates and Governments alike for more than half a century , and the document prepared by the Commission is a milestone in this direction .  
" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee and confirmed by the General Assembly resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council , that had withdrawn from the Ad Hoc Committee in 1989 , would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .  
" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee , confirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council that had withdrawn from the Committee in 1989 would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee , and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
Such normalization should be based on mutual and permanent respect for the real national interests of the two peoples and their States , dealing with issues by peaceful political means and laying the foundation for cooperation between two completely independent and sovereign States .  
An equitable and balanced expansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council , coupled with reforms in its working methods and procedures , would render the Council more responsive and relevant to prevailing geopolitical realities and more open to the participation of small and medium-sized States , which constitute the majority of the Organization .  
They called for the speedy establishment of a permanent international criminal court that would prosecute perpetrators of massive violations of human rights , including perpetrators of egregious acts of racial discrimination .  
NULLThe estimates relating to human resources covered staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts , temporary staff hired for varying durations of time , consultants , contractual personnel and expert groups .  
Member States , particularly those that are unrepresented or underrepresented and those whose desirable range is below the mid-point or that have few women staff in posts subject to geographical distribution , are encouraged to submit the names of qualified , suitable women candidates for vacancies , which are circulated regularly through the permanent missions or in international journals and media .  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
An important area of activity of the Chair shall be the progressive development of a nationwide system of permanent education for democracy and peace through human rights , including the elaboration of special educational programmes for members of such services as the army , the police , penitentiary personnel , the teaching profession , public administration , the judiciary , etc .  
The parties to those negotiations had agreed that permanent status issues should be covered at a later stage of the political process and they had recognized that some issues were so complex and sensitive that an interim period was needed before dealing with them . 
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
This real accounting audit of personnel files , accompanied by a legal and organizational analysis , has revealed a certain number of failings that can be addressed through a proposed organizational arrangement linked to a permanent system of administrative management .  
This makes us hopeful that the Assembly will be able to do so as a permanent part of its daily work , not having to deal with tragic events such as these , but in a healthy and natural way playing its role as the universal , supreme and sovereign organ of the United Nations .  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
In this regard , I am pleased to note that my country enjoys excellent , long-standing diplomatic relations with the five permanent members of the Security Council and that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement , whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in an expression of steadfastness in our convictions and in continued political cooperation . 
In our view , new permanent members should be chosen on the basis not only of equitable geographic representation , but also of such criteria as political , economic and demographic weight , their capability and proven track record of contributing to the promotion of peace , security and development , both regionally and globally , and their commitment to assuming responsibilities inherent to permanent membership .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .  
The present momentum for the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal should not be lost , but should be matched by commensurate political will to ensure that the work is completed in time for a conference in 1998 .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Criteria for the choice of permanent members must be political and economic realities , global constructive engagement of the potential candidates , and their capacity and willingness to contribute in an appropriate fashion to the maintenance of international peace and security , in particular through participation in and support of peacekeeping operations .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
We note with interest that Germany , a nation widely regarded as a potential direct beneficiary of an increase in permanent membership , put forward the idea that new permanent members should not be eternal but subject to periodic review with a 15-year interval in the form of a General Assembly vote .  
It is inconceivable that , in an era when the virtues of democracy and good governance at the national level are being preached , such democracy is not applied at the level of the United Nations and that an entire continent of 54 Member States is not represented in the Security Council in the permanent category .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
Inasmuch as the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for carrying out the major purpose of the United Nations , namely , the achievement and maintenance of world peace and stability , its importance is obvious .  As it has indicated on previous occasions , Japan , with the endorsement of many other countries , is prepared to discharge its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council in accordance with its basic philosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibited by its Constitution .  
Israel ought to have realized and accepted the fundamental truth that the key to its long-term security is not through the permanent occupation of neighbouring territories and the maintenance of a hawkish attitude towards its neighbours , but through the forging of a political compact with these neighbours .  
In welcoming the special envoy of the Secretary-General , Mrs . Sadako Ogata , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , the Prime Minister went even further , and announced the mechanisms planned as a means to establishing permanent consultation on security measures between the military and civilian authorities concerned and the representatives of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
The permanent communications mechanism which the Parties undertake to establish and put into operation in order to facilitate secure , efficient and rapid communications among the respective competent civilian , military and public security authorities and between them and the Security Commission , with a view to preventing incidents , responding to alerts and contributing to the fulfilment of the objectives and obligations set forth in this Treaty . Article 61 .  
Take note of the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } position that three elements ( permanent core capacity ; variable capacity to support ongoing missions and additional capacity to support the liquidation of completed missions ) are essential to the effective coverage of backstopping functions at Headquarters ; that the core capacity should be funded from the regular budget ; and that the variable and additional capacity should be funded from the support account ( paras .  NULL  
Reiterating the urgent need for all concerned in Burundi , including extremists inside and outside the country , to make concerted efforts to defuse the present crisis and to commit themselves to a dialogue aimed at establishing a permanent political settlement and the creation of conditions conducive to national reconciliation ,  
In view of the pattern of meetings and conference-servicing requirements in 1994-1995 , it is expected that any requirements of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that can not be absorbed from within permanent capacity would require an additional appropriation and could not be met from within the reduced budgeted resources for temporary assistance in the approved programme budget for 1996-1997 .  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;  
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
To ensure that the proper mix of permanent , temporary and contractual staff and adequate technological resources are available so that documentation produced in all six official languages is of high quality and is issued in a timely fashion , in strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the various bodies and organs of the United Nations ;  
In the course of the active dialogue , it was suggested that such informal meetings as consultations with permanent missions scheduled by the substantive secretariats prior to sessions of intergovernmental bodies , which are serviced on an " as available " basis , should be coordinated sufficiently in advance with the Interpretation and Meetings Service to ensure that , whenever possible , the same room , staff and interpretation resources were used on a particular day . 
The letter suggested that a permanent union between the two entities and United States citizenship were not guaranteed , that Puerto Rico did not have true political sovereignty , that there was no bilateral compact binding on the United States , and that the status of commonwealth , or any other status adopted under current conditions , would be neither irrevocable nor permanent and was not binding on Congress .  
It urges you to intervene with the Government of the United States of America with a view to halting and preventing any repetition of hostile acts in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law that are being committed by a State that is a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State of the United Nations whose sovereignty , security and territorial integrity are thereby threatened and whose civilian population is thereby left in a state of alarm .  
The concept of national forest programmes should be considered as iterative and in permanent evolution in order to be fully efficient and adapted to changing economic , social and political situations .  
We urge them to find without delay the appropriate political mechanisms to make it possible to find a satisfactory solution to the crisis , with the understanding that only a broad and permanent political settlement providing for how the Government will be shared between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority can constitute the key element for establishing peace and harmony between Burundians , putting Burundi back on the path towards democracy and making possible international cooperation for reconstruction , development and the stability of the country .  
A permanent and independent electoral commission responsible for the conduct of elections would be an indispensable component of a neutral political environment in which parties , candidates and the public have maximum faith in the integrity of the electoral process .  
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
Moreover , there is no permanent international judicial body that could ensure that the alleged perpetrators will be brought to justice , even where both the political will and a functioning judiciary are absent at the national level .  
The national and regional development work-sites , which in times of economic difficulty and in the absence of any sustained creation of productive , stable and permanent jobs , as well as in periods of drought , constitute supplementary employment programmes . 
In addition , comprehensive media support , based on permanent cooperation with the mass media ( national radio and television services , regional radio services , press ) has been developed and gradually strengthened by :  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
The General Assembly , since the adoption of its resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , had adopted a number of principles governing peacekeeping expenditures : collective responsibility of Member States ; utilization of a different funding procedure to that applied to the regular budget ; special responsibility of permanent members of the Security Council ; and greater capacity to pay of developed countries .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
On the question of an increase in permanent membership , many States have retained an open mind , asking legitimate questions regarding the criteria on which to base such a decision , now and in the future , for any course of action adopted will , in fact , establish a precedent .  Can the historical realities which influenced the Council 's composition 50 years ago be paralleled or matched in any way by present contingencies ?  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
The main reason for the unregulated status of hundreds of thousands of permanent residents of Latvia and Estonia of non-Latvian and non-Estonian origin is the legislation of those countries on the basis of which those persons have arbitrarily been deprived of their citizenship and have been declared to be aliens in their own countries of residence whose fundamental political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights are thus being curtailed .  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
For this reason , if a proportion is to be set based on existing types of appointments - despite the fact that the distinction between " career " and " fixed-term " appointments has disappeared to a large degree - it would appear preferable to do so on the basis of " career " appointments , which traditionally include probationary , permanent and indefinite appointments , rather than on the basis of the " fixed-term appointment " label , which covers a wide variety of disparate situations and purposes .  
As is now the case for permanent appointments , the career track appointments would be subject to termination for abolition of post , reduction of staff , on health grounds , for failure to meet the requisite level of performance and for disciplinary reasons . 10 With respect to performance , the new performance appraisal system will allow for a full annual review which would render redundant the review now conducted at the end of the first five years of service under a permanent appointment . 
Israel must fully implement its bilateral and international legal obligations , including , primarily , ending the construction and expansion of settlements , a complete and unconditional withdrawal from the city of Hebron , the release of Palestinian prisoners , and engaging in earnest negotiations in the permanent status talks with the Palestinian Authority in order to find a final and just solution to the question of Palestine .  
MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan , which has become a basic strategic principle of its foreign policy , is the most acceptable approach for Turkmenistan in pursuing its national interests and is in keeping with the country 's historical , geopolitical and ethno-cultural realities .  
In the past year , Turkmenistan adopted a constitutional law on permanent neutrality and a declaration on the international obligations of neutral Turkmenistan in the field of human rights , and set up a national institute for democracy and human rights , which received the support and approval of State and public organizations in various countries .  
The survey and evaluation and the resulting preliminary report shall seek to identify with particularity , at the international , regional and national levels , inter alia , the number and types of human rights educational materials available , existing human rights educational institutes , centres and permanent focal points , national percentages of teachers trained in human rights education , the percentage of schools having adopted human rights curricula at the primary , secondary and post-secondary levels , and number and types of human rights education components in professional training and non-formal education programmes .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost .

The Council holds Israel responsible for driving the Palestinian people into a state of frustration with its refusal to comply with the agreements reached , and it calls upon the permanent members of the Security Council to meet their responsibilities by halting the Israeli attacks , by ensuring that the blockade being maintained against the Palestinian people is lifted and by providing international protection . 
Any approach to combating discrimination against non-citizens should take into account several critical factors including different categories of non-citizens ( e.g . permanent residents , temporary residents , undocumented aliens , etc . ) regarding different categories of rights ( e.g . political rights , civil rights , right to education , social security , other economic rights , etc . ) in countries of different levels of development and offering differing rationales for such distinctions ( e.g . issues of national reciprocity ) .

We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .
