If China 's large enterprises will really compete with multinational enterprise groups in the international markets , they must further resolve the problem of irrational enterprise structure and , in light of the law governing the market economy , form a more reasonable economy of scale as quickly as possible through merger , association , and reorganization .  Enterprises should be large in size , but more importantly they should be powerful in strength .  
Do not look at the gentle and quiet appearance of deputy Li Xianyu of a certain research institute ; this 35 year-old female senior engineer said in powerful tones : " The rapid reaction capability of our units has been greatly enhanced as a result of many years of modernization , and we will certainly not allow the ' Taiwan independence ' forces to split the motherland .

And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .

James Gradoville , a member of the delegation and Motorola regional director of Asia-Pacific government relations , told our reporters : We have consistently emphasized to members of Congress that it should pass a " clean resolution , without strings , " to enable American business to benefit from the opening up of the China market and enable Chinese enterprises to move toward the world still better ; at the same time this will provide a new and powerful motive force for spurring the steady and healthy development of Sino-US relations .  
He said : Following the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the United States and some other Western countries have proceeded from the political need of promoting the Western social system and hegemonism , and therefore are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the socialist path and extremely reluctant to see China adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , continuing to develop and becoming big and powerful .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .

At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
During the 1996 consultations between China and the United States on negotiations on intellectual property rights , China 's fight against copyright piracy in the illegal manufacture of sound and video recordings had an irrefutable record of glorious achievements .  This was powerful proof of the huge effort China has put forth in protecting intellectual property rights .  
Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
Judging from the craft 's own characteristics , they can be used for powerful surprise attacks in a short period from its good mobility , easy concealment nature , accurate firing power and strong antipersonnel force .

In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .

In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .

They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Facts have proved that economic operating pattern is the decisive factor of stimulating and attracting talented personnel , and the foundation for bringing up new-type personnel with the special characteristics of having enterprising spirits , competitive awareness , concepts of law and credibility , and professional ethics lies in the market economy .  The WTO is an invisible and powerful pointer as well as the soil for breeding and hastening parturition .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The creative spirit of the masses of people is respected , the spirit of daring to think and act and be pioneers is recommended and admired in the society , and the new experiences acquired by the masses at the grass-roots level have become a powerful base for the party to formulate policies .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
At an assembly in the capital ardently welcoming back the Yugoslavian embassy personnel , Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech , calling for " the entire party and citizens of all nationalities across the country to turn the immense indignation toward NATO 's savage behavior and great patriotic passion into a powerful motivation to struggle together in one mind and heart for the ongoing strengthening of China 's economic might , national defense forces , and national solidification force " .  
They have brought into full play the exemplary role of the advanced models well in all fields of social life and among various mass groups .  They have vigorously given full scope to healthy tendencies in society and created a fine general mood to respect the advanced and vie with each other to become the advanced .  They have also given a powerful ideological guarantee and intellectual support to creating a fine atmosphere in society for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
In order to establish a rational and just new international and economic order , our country must further reform in greater depth and win world respect and a favorable international political and economic environment with powerful economic strength and comprehensive national strength .  
Even when China is developed and powerful in the future , China 's military capability will always be defensive in nature and be limited to satisfying the minimum security requirement of being able to defend the country 's sovereignty , territorial integrity , and legitimate interests .  
As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .  " I 'm involved with you and you with me , " and this becomes a powerful , material force restraining world war .  
The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .

In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
Yang Jiechi , Chinese ambassador to the United States , chaired this evening 's function .

It is necessary , in line with the requirements of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up ideological and political building , constantly enhance our steadfastness and consciousness in carrying out the party 's line , principles , and policies , energetically endorse and support reform , subordinate ourselves to and serve the overall interests of the state 's economic construction , conscientiously fulfill the fundamental functions of the armed forces , ensure unimpeded implementation of military orders , and provide a powerful security guarantee for the state 's reform , development , and stability .

"  
Over a long period in the past , our economic mode was not diversified , and practice showed that such an economic mode had no vigor and dynamism .  Now , to speed up development , the western areas must develop a mixed economic structure with the publicly owned economy as a main body and with the common development of economies in other ownership forms .  The masses should be mobilized to develop the economy so that the people can get rich when the country becomes powerful .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .

Over the past 100-plus years , the Chinese sons and daughters have all along taken the accomplishment of national " rejuvenation " and the building of an independent , unified , and powerful China as the ideal with greatest depth and the goal to be assiduously sought after .  They have fought heroically on the tortuous roads , one stepping into the breach as another fell , and accumulated invaluable experience at a high price .  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
Fostering high-quality news talent must be a strategic mission , adopting powerful measures and concentrating our efforts to foster a large and renowned group of politically strong , professionally excellent , stylistically honest and strictly disciplined reporters , editors and translators .  
In this new century , young writers are faced with such new major tasks as how to join in the mighty undertaking and the powerful current of the times , magnify the themes of the times and the spirit of unremitting to strive to implement modernized socialism , and inspire people with excellent works ;  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Encouraged by the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and out of the worry about and righteous indignation at the " Taiwan independence " splittist forces ' attempt to split the country , Chinese nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have taken active actions and conscientiously plunged themselves into the powerful current of opposing " Taiwan independence " and division and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland , thus forming a grand-scale upsurge of patriotism .  
International security strategy experts analyzed : The space force that Russia is forming at an accelerated pace will be a strong arm and sharp weapon for Russia to deal with the " space warfare " of the 21st century and ensure national strategic security ; what is more , is a " powerful " move to counter the United States ' NMD .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
This important thinking came from practice and guide practice .  Once this important thinking is combined with practice , it will become a powerful spiritual and material strength and will greatly advance construction of party-building and comprehensive military construction .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
In recent months , administrative and legal organizations at all levels in Shanxi Province have launched a swift and fierce attack , smashing 13 secret criminal gangs and 169 viciously powerful criminal gangs , and apprehending over 1,200 members of secret or violent gangs .

Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
Everyone said , in building a powerful modernized and regularized revolutionary armed forces , it is essential to consistently uphold the fundamental principle of absolute party leadership over the armed forces , and resolutely resist the influence of erroneous trends of thought such as " separating the armed forces from the party , " " depoliticizing the armed forces , " and " nationalizing the armed forces . "  
We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .  
Mu Xiudong , political commissar of a missile brigade of the Second Artillery Corps , said during a discussion that without emancipating its mind and seeking truth from facts - - a spirit of exploring a scientific theory in an in-depth manner - - the party would have been unable to acquire major theoretical innovations , the Chinese nation would have been unable to achieve independence and liberation , building socialism with Chinese characteristics would have been impossible , and there would not have been such powerful national defense as we have today .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
Making full use of the powerful position of junior military academies and strengthening ideological and political education among the children and youth so that they will foster from childhood the fine quality of loving the party , the motherland , the people , and the army and give them training in acquiring a patriotic spirit of a high degree , a strong sense of national defense , a strong will , and strong physique is a major issue that has a bearing on the future of China 's socialist modernization .

When her colors went freely flying in " No Going , No Coming , " which was made out of transparent pieces of acrylic , her thoughts already had no way of completely expressing themselves on a canvas . Then in her powerful work " People / positioning , " she explored the Eastern conception of the mutual interaction between people , objects , time and space .  
People are eager to collect its fearsome lower jaw , and in the USA a great white shark 's jaw can fetch up to US $ 5000 . Such rich rewards are naturally a powerful inducement , and to go shooting great white sharks has become a favorite pastime for Western divers . They also target other shark species , and the skeletons can be seen on sale in gift shops .  
When Tsai Ming-liang went up on stage on December 10 to collect his Golden Horse for best director , he said , choking with emotion , that he hoped his actors would have his good luck in the future . Back stage , he could n't hold back , crying for longer than the film 's famous lachrymose last scene . Finally , calming down and returning to his jocular self , Tsai said , " I had n't known how powerful the Golden Horse Award was , that it would make me cry for so long . "  
The new mayor of Taipei City , Chen Shui-bian , has appointed lieutenant-general Li Tsuo-fu as director of the city 's Department of Military Service , because of his reputation for fair and upright dealing while in the army , which earned him the nickname " the Tiger . " But since ancient times the Chinese have also had the saying that " powerful people are as changeable as tigers , " implying that the actions of the powerful are as unpredictable as the patterns on tigers ' coat are variable .  
Four years ago the villagers of Ssumakussu found a grove of sacred red cypress trees , the largest of which required a chain of 20 people to encircle it . The tree resembles a giant whose powerful arms are raised and open , and its discoverer , neighborhood chief Tseng Chen-chuan , has named it " Ta Lao Ye , " which means " big old gentleman . "  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
Chuo Ko-hua , a scholar of folk customs and ancient monuments who has spent time studying divination poems and who also has an understanding of Chinese herbal medicine , says that the remedies prescribed by medicinal oracles were not powerful and were mainly tonics , but they could sometimes cure minor ailments .  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture . His humor and criticism ought to have pushed modern Chinese to engage in self-reflection and seek progress .  
In the Tang dynasty , brothels were places where the rich and powerful met and mingled , and the entertainers were not only stunningly beautiful , but were also accomplished in every kind of artistic skill and social grace , including " poetry and calligraphy , conversation both serious and humorous , singing and dancing , playing musical instruments and appreciating tea . "  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
On a platform marked " northern lions " stands a stocky , powerful lion with well-defined bones and muscles and the heavy brows and large eyes of a true-grit son of North China . His angry gaze is reminiscent of the many stone lions which crouch along both sides of Marco Polo Bridge , where they witnessed the blood and tears of China 's eight-year war with Japan .  
Chao Ko-shih has seen an even more ridiculous example . One powerful and wealthy old man died from cancer , but because his children had different religious beliefs and each wanted to put on impressive and stately funerals , he ended up with five different ceremonies . The Protestants , Catholics , Buddhists and Taoists each had at least one go at it . When a ceremony ended , they would give him a shot of embalming fluid , put him back in the freezer and wait for the next time !  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .  
Under the old imperial system there was no police force per se , charged with maintaining social order . There were only various types of ruffians and lackeys , who frequently repressed the people and served as the cat 's -paws of corrupt and powerful officials . People assumed the newly formed police were going to be much of the same .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr . Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter . He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful . A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians . I 'm not faced with any major interference or resistance , and I enjoy the support of the people . An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
Chiang warns , " If you take a bank job , you 'd better be ready to bone up on the financial industry , sharpen your sales skills , and become a multi-talented money management advisor . " Financial products are complex and come in infinite variety . Banks badly need powerful systems for integrating financial information , so computer specialists with a strong quantitative grasp of the business will be highly valued by their employers .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
One figure in the business privately complains , " The government has always coddled Taiwan 's banks under the rubric of ' maintaining financial stability , ' and the banks have gotten used to it . You ca n't ask them to get lean and mean overnight . " The financial sector serves as the circulatory system feeding economic development . Taiwan has a powerful manufacturing sector , but a weak financial sector , which has always been a drag on overall national development .  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
But performers who are used to singing in the restrained , thin falsetto of Peking Opera can not be expected to open their throats and produce a powerful voice , capable of reaching out over the orchestra and into the ears of the audience , without comprehensive prior training .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
The site-which has been a tourist attraction ever since the quake hit-has been preserved and turned into an earthquake education park , complete with a museum . If you come by here you 'll not only get a better understanding of the awesome power of nature , but the gigantic enlarged photographs and videos will evoke powerful memories in any Taiwanese who experienced the 921 temblor .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun . " For example , whereas the Atayal , high mountain dwellers like the Bunun , had internal divisions and even wars among themselves , the Bunun were very loyal to the group , maintaining unity against outsiders .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
But in fifth grade , his teacher discovered that this " problem student " could draw powerful and intriguing pictures . The teacher signed Lee up for a province-wide primary-school drawing competition in which , incredibly , he won a prize . This prize seemed to set free the previously locked-up spirit of this small Aboriginal child .  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

China 's market has great potential and faces fierce competition , while Switzerland has many powerful transnational corporations and a large number of small and medium sized companies with unique and professional technology Therefore , the prospects for further development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation are promising  
A number of other policy considerations are involved in such a decision , but such a move would give a very powerful signal that a Government intends to achieve stable economic conditions through the necessary supporting fiscal and monetary policies .  
High levels of poverty and unemployment , lack of distributive justice , social unrest arising from ethnic , cultural and minority differences and powerful vested interests that need to be contained remain barriers , and these must be addressed continuously and simultaneously .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
Moreover , the powerful vitality and steadfast determination which drive peoples to preserve their national traditions and cultural identities demonstrate their will to safeguard from within the inevitable process of international integration something stable and lasting , which links the present of each nation to the roots of its traditions , and the need to affirm the singularity of each society , each nation and each community , and not only of each individual .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
Today , when the international political situation opens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the jurisdiction of the Court , anachronisms , conservative tendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent the total flourishing of an international judicial order binding on all , beginning with the most powerful among us . 
Unless the Organization effectively demonstrates its ability to guarantee the international legal order over and above " international policies " dominated by the most powerful nations , under which economic and trade embargoes are imposed and the principles of non-intervention are violated , the international system will without doubt soon be in its painful and prolonged death throes .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
Our economy , although subject to the blockade , will grow and will provide for and meet the most pressing needs of our people .  The powerful infrastructure that we have built up over three decades with what some have called the subsidy that Cuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of education and culture and a stable land of peace and order .  
Each of these from the most powerful to the least , from the leaders of Mozambique 's political parties to the poorest citizen walking to a ballot box in the countryside , from senior officials in this grand building to the youngest private in a blue helmet who guarded a lonely road-crossing in the bush all can be proud of what their work together has accomplished .  
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
Executive Board decision 94 / 14 synthesized and built on a decade of gradual reform , 1 / providing UNDP with the three principal goals of ( a ) strengthening international cooperation for sustainable human development ; ( b ) helping the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for human development ; and ( c ) focusing UNDP resources on making the maximum contribution in its programme countries to key SHD dimensions .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
It is nevertheless my firm belief , formed as a result of my experience as Minister of Education and Training and reinforced by a host of conferences and symposiums and a variety of studies and surveys at the national , regional and international levels , that these twin assets of Vietnamese women will not be fully exploitable as long as women lack the powerful and intensive catalyst of education . 
Nations intervention should be confined to situations which posed an unquestionable threat to international peace and security and where Security Council decisions were based on the clearly expressed support of the majority of Member States , rather than on the political exigencies of a few States , no matter how powerful they might be .  
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Ten years separate us from the early-morning hours of 26 April 1986 when two powerful explosions in rapid succession destroyed the Unit 4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , exposing the burning core and releasing 50-million curies of radioactive isotopes into the environment .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Measures should be taken to prevent the introduction and use of unrelated , irrelevant and inappropriate issues by more powerful countries as a means of gaining advantage in global trade and investment , or as unfair leverage in imposing inappropriate conditions and policies on dependent countries .  
We must express our gratitude to all our compatriots , to our friends abroad and to the entire Ukrainian community , whose understanding and support were a sturdy pillar , a powerful force driving the constitutional process .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
All the endeavours to establish a new , just and equitable economic world order , free of humiliating conditions and restrictive and onerous practices , are brutally challenged by a powerful minority that reserves the worst and cruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet . 
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
The media have an essential part to play since , in addition to their powerful educative role , they play a decisive role in ensuring the exercise of freedom of opinion , expression and information which is a vital factor in the strengthening of peace and international understanding and in promoting a culture of peace .  61 .  In promoting a culture of peace , the role of those whose activity has a direct and multiplier impact on the minds is of prime importance .  
We want it to be a strong , principled and effective body , the common inheritance of all mankind , not the preserve of a few wealthy and powerful States , but the guardian of all , especially the poor , the weak and the defenceless . 
Adoption of the optional protocol would be a powerful signal in favour of economic , social and cultural rights , a sign that the international community wants to take them seriously and put the two types of rights on an equal footing .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
Apart from avoiding potentially protracted litigation , the parties often take into account the potential difficulty of overcoming what might be regarded by the court or arbitral tribunal as a powerful recommendation , as it had been made by independent experts familiar with the project from the outset , and was based on contemporaneous observation of the project prior to , and at the time of , the dispute having first arisen .  
Spains administrative , academic and scientific institutions have attained a high level of scientific and technical development and the necessary capabilities to ensure that the present role of remote sensing as a powerful tool in environmental management will be strengthened in the near future .  
At a secondary level , therefore , State obligations require active protection against other , more assertive or aggressive subjects _ more powerful economic interests , such as protection against fraud , against unethical behaviour in trade and contractual relations , against the marketing and dumping of hazardous or dangerous products .  
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance . 
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
In spite of our unflinching commitment to the provisions of the NPT and repeated calls over the years to be assured , through a legally binding international instrument , against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by our powerful partners , their response has not been at all reassuring .  
With fresh confidence and courage , the entire Korean people in the north , the south and overseas will spur the national reunification movement and build a reunified , prosperous and powerful State in the near future .  
The plain fact is that the openness of the most powerful nations to accept rational and realistic changes in the Security Council is a key indicator of the future of global multilateral relations in general and of this Organization in particular .  
Your endorsement hopefully through a presidential statement of the need for the United Nations to remain fully committed through a predictable and dependable source of funding for the post-independence requirements of East Timor which perhaps more than any other country will be the child of the United Nations and of this Council will send a powerful , reassuring message to the people and to the Second Transitional Government , which has a huge challenge before it in the months ahead , as well as to the Constituent Assembly of East Timor .

In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
The tremendous achievements in economic and social development , which have been attained in the past 20 years by Shenzhen , the special economic zone personally founded by Deng Xiaoping and formed with the painstaking efforts of the second and third generations of the leading collectives of the party 's central committee , are the powerful evidence of our party 's endeavor to act as the " Three Represents " in the new period , and have laid the solid foundation for Shenzhen to take the lead in basically realizing socialist modernization .

He said : Following the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , the United States and some other Western countries have proceeded from the political need of promoting the Western social system and hegemonism , and therefore are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the socialist path and extremely reluctant to see China adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace , continuing to develop and becoming big and powerful .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
After that , Japan set its sight on the objectives of becoming a political power and a military power .  It has attempted to use its powerful economic , scientific , and technological strength to speed up the development of its military strength in order to exercise greater clout in global affairs , particularly in the Asian political arena .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .

Conscientious organization of the singing of these songs by military personnel is of major significance to nurture high ethical standards for officers and men , to carry forward the excellent tradition and style of the people 's army , to build an excellent image for a powerful and civilized army , and to promote reform of ideological and political education .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .

In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .

In his speech , Wang Ke pointed out that Chairman Jiang 's major expositions on logistical work , which closely evolve around the national and military conditions and address such basic questions as what logistics should be built and how to develop logistics , represent a new development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's military logistical ideology , a scientific summary of logistical work 's features and patterns under a new situation , and a powerful ideological weapon and an action guidebook for military logistical modernization in a new era .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
The theoretical connotation of the English word " governance " is rather complicated .  It refers to a framework on the global level composed of accepted principles , norms , and systems , which can provide a basis for cooperation without the intervention of powerful central authorities .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
Thus , we must continue to enhance our national defense strength , and tempered a sharp and powerful " sword " of justice for safeguarding the sovereign and territorial integrity of socialist China and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation .  
It is a major political advantage of our Party and state.Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech is not only a powerful ideological weapon to strengthen ideological and political construction in the military , but also the fundamental strategy for devoting efforts to doing well the positive " Three Stresses " education in grassroots organizations and for correctly handling the relationship between the education and work .

They should become an advanced collective that makes contributions to constructing our country 's material and spiritual civilizations .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
Facts have proved that economic operating pattern is the decisive factor of stimulating and attracting talented personnel , and the foundation for bringing up new-type personnel with the special characteristics of having enterprising spirits , competitive awareness , concepts of law and credibility , and professional ethics lies in the market economy .  The WTO is an invisible and powerful pointer as well as the soil for breeding and hastening parturition .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The creative spirit of the masses of people is respected , the spirit of daring to think and act and be pioneers is recommended and admired in the society , and the new experiences acquired by the masses at the grass-roots level have become a powerful base for the party to formulate policies .

The splendid achievements in the Ninth Five-year Plan period have again told the world the indisputable fact : Deng Xiaoping Theory is the great banner leading us from victory to victory , and the party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has the superb leading ability of controlling the overall situation , dealing with all kinds of complicated situation , and leading all the people of the whole country in forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , and is a powerful and reliable leading collective .  
At an assembly in the capital ardently welcoming back the Yugoslavian embassy personnel , Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech , calling for " the entire party and citizens of all nationalities across the country to turn the immense indignation toward NATO 's savage behavior and great patriotic passion into a powerful motivation to struggle together in one mind and heart for the ongoing strengthening of China 's economic might , national defense forces , and national solidification force " .  
They have brought into full play the exemplary role of the advanced models well in all fields of social life and among various mass groups .  They have vigorously given full scope to healthy tendencies in society and created a fine general mood to respect the advanced and vie with each other to become the advanced .  They have also given a powerful ideological guarantee and intellectual support to creating a fine atmosphere in society for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
Acting as a key force to safeguard national security and world peace , our army should continue carrying forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism - - not fearing oppression and ghosts and not believing the evil .  Meanwhile , our army should have a clear-cut stand to oppose hegemonism and power politics and provide a powerful backing for creating a peaceful international environment and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
In order to establish a rational and just new international and economic order , our country must further reform in greater depth and win world respect and a favorable international political and economic environment with powerful economic strength and comprehensive national strength .

As capital , technology , goods , services , labor , information , and other productive factors flow outward across regions , overstepping national boundaries , and transcending cultures and concepts of values , this links the whole world more tightly together through common markets , mutual trade , and shared interests .

The two sides unanimously held that the five principles of peaceful coexistence , which were advocated by the two countries 47 years ago and have subsequently been widely recognized and practiced by the international community since then , are still shining in resplendent fashion and maintaining powerful vitality today , and represent the cornerstone in building a new international political and economic order .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .

In the face of the ever-changing international situation and intense international competition , without a lofty idea , firm conviction and powerful spiritual mainstay , it is impossible for comrades of the entire party and people throughout the country to make our country powerful , invigorate our nation and basically realize our socialist modernization in the middle of this century .  Without a strong rallying power and brilliant creativity , it is impossible for them to do so .  Without an indomitable will and concerted efforts , it is also impossible for them to do so .  
To unite and ally all social strata , ethnic groups , political parties and groups to the greatest degree , and form an enormous and powerful revolutionary and constructive army is the fundamental strategy of the Communist Party of China in leading the people to fulfill national liberation and rejuvenation .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
Yang Jiechi , Chinese ambassador to the United States , chaired this evening 's function .

"  
Over a long period in the past , our economic mode was not diversified , and practice showed that such an economic mode had no vigor and dynamism .  Now , to speed up development , the western areas must develop a mixed economic structure with the publicly owned economy as a main body and with the common development of economies in other ownership forms .  The masses should be mobilized to develop the economy so that the people can get rich when the country becomes powerful .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
The " three represents " advocates the realm of a communist 's lofty thought , which is going with development of productive forces , advocating advanced cultures , and giving primary consideration in all ways to the interests of the people .  This spirit is a powerful spiritual driving force for us to ensure thorough implementation of all work and to truthfully realize the demand that the party exercises absolute leadership over the military .

Over the past 100-plus years , the Chinese sons and daughters have all along taken the accomplishment of national " rejuvenation " and the building of an independent , unified , and powerful China as the ideal with greatest depth and the goal to be assiduously sought after .  They have fought heroically on the tortuous roads , one stepping into the breach as another fell , and accumulated invaluable experience at a high price .  
Relying on its strength in science and technology and its powerful armaments , the United States has set up a worldwide intelligence system for collecting from land , air , below the sea , and indeed from space political , military , and economic intelligence on all parts of the world , so as to serve its pursuit of global hegemony and creation of a unipolar world .  
Fostering high-quality news talent must be a strategic mission , adopting powerful measures and concentrating our efforts to foster a large and renowned group of politically strong , professionally excellent , stylistically honest and strictly disciplined reporters , editors and translators .  
In this new century , young writers are faced with such new major tasks as how to join in the mighty undertaking and the powerful current of the times , magnify the themes of the times and the spirit of unremitting to strive to implement modernized socialism , and inspire people with excellent works ;  
In light of the many and heavy tasks faced by brigades and regiments , their Party committee secretaries should pay special attention to observing and analyzing the situation from the political perspective , adhere to the correct direction of military construction , give top priority to ideological administration and education .  They should rely on correct education and instruction to assure that the military is under the Party 's effective control and rely on the powerful spiritual backbone to unite military professionals and inspire their fighting spirit .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Encouraged by the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and out of the worry about and righteous indignation at the " Taiwan independence " splittist forces ' attempt to split the country , Chinese nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals of Chinese origin have taken active actions and conscientiously plunged themselves into the powerful current of opposing " Taiwan independence " and division and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland , thus forming a grand-scale upsurge of patriotism .  
International security strategy experts analyzed : The space force that Russia is forming at an accelerated pace will be a strong arm and sharp weapon for Russia to deal with the " space warfare " of the 21st century and ensure national strategic security ; what is more , is a " powerful " move to counter the United States ' NMD .  
It is the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force inspiring people of different ethnic backgrounds in the whole region to fight bravely in unity .  It is a powerful ideological weapon enabling us to know and transform the world .  We must always uphold it without wavering .  
Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
This important thinking came from practice and guide practice .  Once this important thinking is combined with practice , it will become a powerful spiritual and material strength and will greatly advance construction of party-building and comprehensive military construction .  
Thus rational and correct command decisions are bound to unleash powerful capability for a belligerent in winning a war with its existing fighting capacity , even under adverse circumstances .  
For example , a belligerent will have to concentrate forces for a " move " aimed at forcing the enemy to submit to its own will and intention , through releasing a large amount of powerful information .  A belligerent will also have to release information intended to highlight its own strong points and the enemy 's weaknesses , sow discord between the enemy troops , and unleash a psychological attack on the enemy , thus putting psychological pressure on the enemy , weakening the enemy 's will , and " winning a war without fighting " .  
In recent months , administrative and legal organizations at all levels in Shanxi Province have launched a swift and fierce attack , smashing 13 secret criminal gangs and 169 viciously powerful criminal gangs , and apprehending over 1,200 members of secret or violent gangs .

Mao Zedong 's thinking on the untied front , Deng Xiaoping 's theory on the united front in the new period , and the theses of the party 's third-generation leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core on the united front provide the powerful ideological weapons for guiding the triumphant advanced of the united front .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
It is not a special case .  With the many favorable conditions , the Chen Shui-bian administration has speedily entered a stage of good diplomatic relations with the United States . On the contrary , the new politically powerful in Washington had a poor opinion of the Chinese Communists , which greatly deteriorated further after the Chinese Communists ' handling of the military plane collision incident caused ill feelings among the American people .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
We should persist in sticking to the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , vigorously bring about our prosperous socialist culture and make efforts to provide our reform , opening up and modernization with a powerful spiritual motive power and ideological guarantee .  
Everyone said , in building a powerful modernized and regularized revolutionary armed forces , it is essential to consistently uphold the fundamental principle of absolute party leadership over the armed forces , and resolutely resist the influence of erroneous trends of thought such as " separating the armed forces from the party , " " depoliticizing the armed forces , " and " nationalizing the armed forces . "  
We must insist on grasping two links simultaneously and being firm on both hands , intensify the construction of spiritual civilization , arm people with scientific theory , guide people with correct public opinion , mold people with lofty spirit , inspire people with excellent works , and provide powerful spiritual motivation with reform , opening up , and modernization .

The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
The more powerful the backwave , the faster the base will be washed away . Given this vicious cycle , both dikes made of steel reinforced concrete or " breakwaters " made up of huge concrete tetrapods dropped into the ocean off the coast are both are basically weak structures that require continual repair . Dikes must be periodically raised and new concrete tetrapods laid down .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
She would frequently paint beyond the borders of the picture frames or add wooden blocks to the flat surface . When her colors went freely flying in " No Going , No Coming , " which was made out of transparent pieces of acrylic , her thoughts already had no way of completely expressing themselves on a canvas . Then in her powerful work " People / positioning , " she explored the Eastern conception of the mutual interaction between people , objects , time and space .  
People are eager to collect its fearsome lower jaw , and in the USA a great white shark 's jaw can fetch up to US $ 5000 . Such rich rewards are naturally a powerful inducement , and to go shooting great white sharks has become a favorite pastime for Western divers . They also target other shark species , and the skeletons can be seen on sale in gift shops .  
When Tsai Ming-liang went up on stage on December 10 to collect his Golden Horse for best director , he said , choking with emotion , that he hoped his actors would have his good luck in the future . Back stage , he could n't hold back , crying for longer than the film 's famous lachrymose last scene . Finally , calming down and returning to his jocular self , Tsai said , " I had n't known how powerful the Golden Horse Award was , that it would make me cry for so long . "  
The new mayor of Taipei City , Chen Shui-bian , has appointed lieutenant-general Li Tsuo-fu as director of the city 's Department of Military Service , because of his reputation for fair and upright dealing while in the army , which earned him the nickname " the Tiger . " But since ancient times the Chinese have also had the saying that " powerful people are as changeable as tigers , " implying that the actions of the powerful are as unpredictable as the patterns on tigers ' coat are variable .  
Four years ago the villagers of Ssumakussu found a grove of sacred red cypress trees , the largest of which required a chain of 20 people to encircle it . The tree resembles a giant whose powerful arms are raised and open , and its discoverer , neighborhood chief Tseng Chen-chuan , has named it " Ta Lao Ye , " which means " big old gentleman . "  
Fan applies the differences in the value systems of men and women that psychologists have uncovered to the news media . She notes that , compared to men , women are less likely to be concerned with winning and losing ; women are more concerned with process . Women also do not like abstract and obscure theories , but prefer to see stories about the human side of things - - about how people live their lives . Women are no less interested in ordinary people and disadvantaged groups than they are in the powerful and successful .  
Chuo Ko-hua , a scholar of folk customs and ancient monuments who has spent time studying divination poems and who also has an understanding of Chinese herbal medicine , says that the remedies prescribed by medicinal oracles were not powerful and were mainly tonics , but they could sometimes cure minor ailments .  
Looking at the evolution of " sexual affairs " in dynasties down the ages , a regular pattern emerges : the more prosperous and powerful a dynasty was , the less restrictions it placed on people in sexual matters ; while the more weak and corrupt a dynasty was , the more tightly it controlled people 's lives , and the more severe the constraints it placed on sex .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
During the years of the preposterous and unprecedented Cultural Revolution , I finally realized that the difference between Mao Zedong and Karl Marx was that Mao extended the scope of the powerful machinery of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the political and economic sphere into the domain of the human mind .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture . His humor and criticism ought to have pushed modern Chinese to engage in self-reflection and seek progress .  
In the Tang dynasty , brothels were places where the rich and powerful met and mingled , and the entertainers were not only stunningly beautiful , but were also accomplished in every kind of artistic skill and social grace , including " poetry and calligraphy , conversation both serious and humorous , singing and dancing , playing musical instruments and appreciating tea . "  
Anyone who has eaten kimche before might have an idea what to expect in Korean vegetarian cooking . The variety of vegetables is simple ; and steaming , boiling , and scalding are the most common cooking techniques . Oil is not often used , with sugar , soy sauce , sesame oil , hot peppers , and garlic-all ( save sugar ) powerful acrid flavorings-being preferred . Jung really enjoys this style , and feels that these are simple vegetarian recipes that people can use for a long time without getting tired of them .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
The recovery in exports indicates that the threat of domestic deindustrialization has for the most part abated , and economic restructuring has been effective . The rise of the petrochemical , computer , and electronics industries suggests that Taiwan has already staked out a place for itself in the future world economy . As far as the stock market is concerned , the increase in exports means more capital at home , becoming a powerful force reinvigorating the bourse .  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
Hsieh notes that in the US , sectors such as the steel and automotive industries have powerful labor unions which can play a leading role in determining the direction which relations between labor and management take , so there is no need for the government to get involved ; and in various European countries , left-wing labor alliances are just as powerful as right-wing political parties , and alternate with them in government , so the idea of " collective bargaining " is not an empty phrase .  
On a platform marked " northern lions " stands a stocky , powerful lion with well-defined bones and muscles and the heavy brows and large eyes of a true-grit son of North China . His angry gaze is reminiscent of the many stone lions which crouch along both sides of Marco Polo Bridge , where they witnessed the blood and tears of China 's eight-year war with Japan .  
Chao Ko-shih has seen an even more ridiculous example . One powerful and wealthy old man died from cancer , but because his children had different religious beliefs and each wanted to put on impressive and stately funerals , he ended up with five different ceremonies . The Protestants , Catholics , Buddhists and Taoists each had at least one go at it . When a ceremony ended , they would give him a shot of embalming fluid , put him back in the freezer and wait for the next time !  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .  
Under the old imperial system there was no police force per se , charged with maintaining social order . There were only various types of ruffians and lackeys , who frequently repressed the people and served as the cat 's -paws of corrupt and powerful officials . People assumed the newly formed police were going to be much of the same .  
Under the ROC 's " Standard Criteria for Identifying Hazardous Industrial Wastes , " hazardous wastes are divided into three major categories . The first comprises specifically listed substances which are generated by industrial processes or are inherently toxic . The second comprises substances defined as hazardous by their characteristics , including those which are corrosive , flammable or infectious ( mostly medical waste ) , or contain individual non-ferrous metals . This includes substances such as powerful oxidants which may cause other materials to ignite .  
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly . They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .  
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr . Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter . He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful . A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians . I 'm not faced with any major interference or resistance , and I enjoy the support of the people . An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
Although the political gulf between family members was perhaps not as wide as it had been in previous decades , he was worried that a scholar like himself might not have what it took to do a good job as principal after a lifetime of operating within a socialist system and enjoying powerful political backing .  
Chiang warns , " If you take a bank job , you 'd better be ready to bone up on the financial industry , sharpen your sales skills , and become a multi-talented money management advisor . " Financial products are complex and come in infinite variety . Banks badly need powerful systems for integrating financial information , so computer specialists with a strong quantitative grasp of the business will be highly valued by their employers .  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
One figure in the business privately complains , " The government has always coddled Taiwan 's banks under the rubric of ' maintaining financial stability , ' and the banks have gotten used to it . You ca n't ask them to get lean and mean overnight . " The financial sector serves as the circulatory system feeding economic development . Taiwan has a powerful manufacturing sector , but a weak financial sector , which has always been a drag on overall national development .  
This cultural symbol of " steady devotion " symbolizes the determination of Kukeng Rural Township to leave behind its image as a disaster-stricken area and to welcome the future with open arms . This determination , in turn , recalls the way this unpromising area-surrounded by water on three sides , with powerful dust storms during the seasonal winds in winter and heavily saline soil-has still managed to produce agricultural products like paddy rice , sugar cane , peanuts , corn , squash , and melon seeds .  
" The growth of the false cypress forests represents a process of stabilization of the rolling mountain rivers . The false cypress trees are the living deities of the process of natural restoration of the land , " writes Chen Yu-feng in his book The Flora of Taiwan . In particular , the medium-elevation cloud forests are unstable zones of heavy rainfall and powerful erosion , and when mighty false cypress trees spring up along the lines of collapse they mend the gashes in the forest and bring new life to the broken ground .  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
But performers who are used to singing in the restrained , thin falsetto of Peking Opera can not be expected to open their throats and produce a powerful voice , capable of reaching out over the orchestra and into the ears of the audience , without comprehensive prior training .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
The site-which has been a tourist attraction ever since the quake hit-has been preserved and turned into an earthquake education park , complete with a museum . If you come by here you 'll not only get a better understanding of the awesome power of nature , but the gigantic enlarged photographs and videos will evoke powerful memories in any Taiwanese who experienced the 921 temblor .  
Perhaps the SARS outbreak can remind humankind that regardless of ethnic differences , of how powerful a nation may be , and of whether it stands at the center or on the periphery of world affairs , in the face of a tiny virus the divisions and conflicts of the human world are nothing more than a farce . In the face of the disease , ideological and ethnic differences that are often seen as insurmountable , come to appear insignificant .  
The outbreak of an epidemic of the pre-viously unknown disease SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) revealed a Taiwan public health system shot through with flaws . But twenty years ago , Taiwan had suppressed malaria , Japanese encephalitis , infantile paralysis , and other infectious diseases and had successfully set up a powerful frontline , grassroots defense network against epidemics .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun . " For example , whereas the Atayal , high mountain dwellers like the Bunun , had internal divisions and even wars among themselves , the Bunun were very loyal to the group , maintaining unity against outsiders .  
But on the other hand , the promotion of creativity certainly does make contemporary society more diverse and interesting . Thus some school principals try to inspire a greater love of learning in their students with a performance of ballet . Or powerful political and business leaders are delighted to join in a costume show during New Year office parties . Even corpses , not normally put on public show , can be shaped and sculpted into all kinds of forms and go on a global tour .  
But in fifth grade , his teacher discovered that this " problem student " could draw powerful and intriguing pictures . The teacher signed Lee up for a province-wide primary-school drawing competition in which , incredibly , he won a prize . This prize seemed to set free the previously locked-up spirit of this small Aboriginal child .  
The first typhoon to strike Taiwan this year , Typhoon Mindulle , swept in from the southwest at the start of July , bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds and causing massive landslides and coastal flooding . Once again , having been through the disasters of the 921 earthquake of 1999 and 2001 ' s Typhoons Toraji and Nari , the people of central Taiwan faced the hardship of losing livelihoods and loved ones .

China 's market has great potential and faces fierce competition , while Switzerland has many powerful transnational corporations and a large number of small and medium sized companies with unique and professional technology Therefore , the prospects for further development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation are promising  
A number of other policy considerations are involved in such a decision , but such a move would give a very powerful signal that a Government intends to achieve stable economic conditions through the necessary supporting fiscal and monetary policies .  
High levels of poverty and unemployment , lack of distributive justice , social unrest arising from ethnic , cultural and minority differences and powerful vested interests that need to be contained remain barriers , and these must be addressed continuously and simultaneously .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
Moreover , the powerful vitality and steadfast determination which drive peoples to preserve their national traditions and cultural identities demonstrate their will to safeguard from within the inevitable process of international integration something stable and lasting , which links the present of each nation to the roots of its traditions , and the need to affirm the singularity of each society , each nation and each community , and not only of each individual .  
It is to wonder how the scales of justice can operate and extend their influence when not backed up by a powerful sword if I may transpose into the international sphere the familiar thought patterns of the municipal order which has accustomed us to the trilogy so dear to Montesquieu of legislative , executive and judicial powers .  
Today , when the international political situation opens up vast prospects for frequent recourse to the jurisdiction of the Court , anachronisms , conservative tendencies and all kinds of interests unfortunately prevent the total flourishing of an international judicial order binding on all , beginning with the most powerful among us . 
Unless the Organization effectively demonstrates its ability to guarantee the international legal order over and above " international policies " dominated by the most powerful nations , under which economic and trade embargoes are imposed and the principles of non-intervention are violated , the international system will without doubt soon be in its painful and prolonged death throes .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
Our economy , although subject to the blockade , will grow and will provide for and meet the most pressing needs of our people .  The powerful infrastructure that we have built up over three decades with what some have called the subsidy that Cuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of education and culture and a stable land of peace and order .  
Each of these from the most powerful to the least , from the leaders of Mozambique 's political parties to the poorest citizen walking to a ballot box in the countryside , from senior officials in this grand building to the youngest private in a blue helmet who guarded a lonely road-crossing in the bush all can be proud of what their work together has accomplished .  
The world 's less powerful countries and those of lesser political , military and economic influence have thus become wary of the exploitation of global humanitarian principles and objectives to serve the purposes of some parties rather than others .  
Executive Board decision 94 / 14 synthesized and built on a decade of gradual reform , 1 / providing UNDP with the three principal goals of ( a ) strengthening international cooperation for sustainable human development ; ( b ) helping the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for human development ; and ( c ) focusing UNDP resources on making the maximum contribution in its programme countries to key SHD dimensions .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
NULLThe combination of remote-sensing data with global positioning and geographic information systems ( GIS ) can provide a powerful means for more precise interpretation of data if a sufficient level of expertise and technical resources is available .  
It is nevertheless my firm belief , formed as a result of my experience as Minister of Education and Training and reinforced by a host of conferences and symposiums and a variety of studies and surveys at the national , regional and international levels , that these twin assets of Vietnamese women will not be fully exploitable as long as women lack the powerful and intensive catalyst of education . 
Nations intervention should be confined to situations which posed an unquestionable threat to international peace and security and where Security Council decisions were based on the clearly expressed support of the majority of Member States , rather than on the political exigencies of a few States , no matter how powerful they might be .  
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Ten years separate us from the early-morning hours of 26 April 1986 when two powerful explosions in rapid succession destroyed the Unit 4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , exposing the burning core and releasing 50-million curies of radioactive isotopes into the environment .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
Measures should be taken to prevent the introduction and use of unrelated , irrelevant and inappropriate issues by more powerful countries as a means of gaining advantage in global trade and investment , or as unfair leverage in imposing inappropriate conditions and policies on dependent countries .  
We must express our gratitude to all our compatriots , to our friends abroad and to the entire Ukrainian community , whose understanding and support were a sturdy pillar , a powerful force driving the constitutional process .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
We have been enthusiastic supporters of all initiatives aimed at limiting the arms trade , in addition to being aware that there are free markets often beyond Government control , we are concerned that the industrialized countries , by lifting embargoes in this field , may begin moving towards the opposite extreme and promote the sale of weapons everywhere , under pressure from the military industry , which has an extremely powerful lobby . 
All the endeavours to establish a new , just and equitable economic world order , free of humiliating conditions and restrictive and onerous practices , are brutally challenged by a powerful minority that reserves the worst and cruellest of the infernos for the rest of the planet . 
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
Widespread abuses appear to be ongoing within the context of an oppressive military presence , continuing environmental damage and the cultural subordination of indigenous people in the face of the massive exploitation of resources by powerful multinational corporations .  
At the same tie , however , the legitimate wishes of many States to combat international terrorism were being held hostage by the double standards of powerful countries that preached against terrorism even as they impeded the negotiations on the draft Convention on the matter with all the diplomatic means and political pressure at their disposal , thus blocking the adoption of the clear and all-inclusive definition of terrorism that was needed and an unequivocal and impartial condemnation . 
The Platform for Action adopted at the Conference was established as a powerful tool for the empowerment of women , aimed at removing all the obstacles to womens active participation in public and private life by promoting their full and equal participation in economic , social , cultural and political decision-making processes .  
The media have an essential part to play since , in addition to their powerful educative role , they play a decisive role in ensuring the exercise of freedom of opinion , expression and information which is a vital factor in the strengthening of peace and international understanding and in promoting a culture of peace .  61 .  In promoting a culture of peace , the role of those whose activity has a direct and multiplier impact on the minds is of prime importance .

Adoption of the optional protocol would be a powerful signal in favour of economic , social and cultural rights , a sign that the international community wants to take them seriously and put the two types of rights on an equal footing .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
The remark was also made that the topic of diplomatic protection involved a series of complicated theoretical and practical questions and had an unfortunate history , having been regarded as an extension of colonial power or a system imposed by powerful States on weak States .  
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
Apart from avoiding potentially protracted litigation , the parties often take into account the potential difficulty of overcoming what might be regarded by the court or arbitral tribunal as a powerful recommendation , as it had been made by independent experts familiar with the project from the outset , and was based on contemporaneous observation of the project prior to , and at the time of , the dispute having first arisen .  
Spains administrative , academic and scientific institutions have attained a high level of scientific and technical development and the necessary capabilities to ensure that the present role of remote sensing as a powerful tool in environmental management will be strengthened in the near future .  
At a secondary level , therefore , State obligations require active protection against other , more assertive or aggressive subjects _ more powerful economic interests , such as protection against fraud , against unethical behaviour in trade and contractual relations , against the marketing and dumping of hazardous or dangerous products .  
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
A common factor in all those problems is the need to have integrated information systems existing in a distributed manner but linked through powerful networks able to serve as the backbone for national developmental and global research activities .  
Encouraging concerted efforts by [ international organizations and powerful countries / the international community Australia , EU ] to establish favourable conditions for the fuller and equitable integration of African and the least developed countries into the global community [ in terms of encouraging debt relief and structural adjustment policies sensitive to the needs of these countries Canada ] ;  
Developing countries did not question the intrinsic potential of trade as a powerful ingredient of growth , and many were more committed to a rule-based multilateral trading system than were their major developed trading partners , for whom unilateralism was always both an alternative and a temptation .  
The institutions that , more than national governments , govern the real lives of billions today the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , the G-7 , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) are dominated by a few rich and powerful countries , and there is no transparency , no accountability , no effective mechanism for civil society participation.In short , there is no good governance . 
Our new system is clearly seriously flawed when a dispute between two powerful transatlantic partners can be settled in a political vacuum which totally ignores the very real and disastrous consequences it will inevitably unleash on the economies of a fragile group of small States . This is certainly not globalization with a human face . 
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .
