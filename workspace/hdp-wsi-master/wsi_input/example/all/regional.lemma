The President of the Agricultural Bank , Yang Mingsheng , said that with the speeding up of economic integration in the Yangtze River Delta , the region had formed many favorable conditions like a fast economic transition , and more market-orientated and standardized government management .  A Healthy and sound environment and conditions are available for the regional cooperative development of the branches of the Agricultural Bank .  
The basic framework of the study includes : The current population situation and developmental conditions of the Yangtze Delta Region , the regional property development , the developmental trends in property structure and employment population , the developmental trends in urbanization and the development of cities , the total population and the ecological carrying capacity of population resources , the aging of the population , and the social security system of urban and rural areas .  
Wu said China and Ethiopia boast traditional friendship and they have always supported each other , shared common views on many major international and regional issues , and maintained sound consultations and cooperation in international affairs .  
After the end of the cold war , ASEAN confronted new international and regional situations and comprehensively adjusted its development strategy and foreign relations strategy , and increasingly became a cooperative organization in the southeast Asia region based on economic cooperation and integrating politics , economy and security .  
He pointed out that in the United Nations affairs , China has been consistently abiding by the goals and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter , seriously fulfilling its responsibilities , actively supporting various kinds of United Nations work done in the spirit of the Charter , and has made constructive efforts and positive contributions to maintaining world peace , seeking the just and reasonable resolution of major international and regional issues , protecting the interests of developing countries , and the promotion of equal co-operation and understanding among various countries .  
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Huaqiu Liu held talks with Kamyao here on the 29th .  Both parties exchanged opinions in depth regarding further developing bilateral relations and also international and regional problems that were of common concern , and they achieved widespread agreement .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .

Dai Xianglong said : Implementing the strategy of developing the western regions is an important plan for restructuring the economy and promoting the coordinated development of regional economies .  It is an important measure for increasing domestic demand and promoting the sustained , rapid and coordinated development of the national economy .  It is also an important opportunity for the restructuring of bank credits and promoting the development of banking .  
During the discussion , officers and men reviewed the army 's glorious history in fighting the people 's war , defeating the strong by the weak , and defeating the superior by the inferior .  They spoke glowingly of the army 's tremendous achievements in revolutionization , modernization , and regularization and reaffirmed their confidence of winning the regional war under the high-tech condition .  
He said that making great development in the Western Region is an important operation to expand domestic demands and promote sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy as well as an important deployment for strategically readjusting economic structure and promoting coordinated development of regional economy .  
In the course of town construction , attention should be focused on the concentration of industries and population ; through the use of regional and industrial policies , economic levers , and administrative measures , we should guide and promote the concentration of secondary and tertiary industries in towns and accept the stimulating influence of major cities so that towns ' economic and population scales will increase rapidly .  
Under the guidance of the party Central Committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in Guangxi have built a poor and backward Guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .  
After the closing of the session , a meeting will be held on 16 March to present the proposals placed on file to relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee and central state organs , provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal party committees , the people 's governments , and relevant mass organizations and units for handling .  
We should continue to uphold the principle of attaching simultaneous attention to preventing and improving pollution and protecting the ecology , strive to control the total discharge of pollutants and strengthen pollution prevention and treatment in major cities , rivers and regional sea areas in a bid to improve environmental quality and promote ecological balance .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
Total discharge volume control plans for the state-defined major river basins shall be drawn up by the State Council 's environmental protection department in conjunction with relevant departments of the State Council after consulting with the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned and be submitted to the State Council for approval .  
Total discharge volume control plans for other water bodies shall be drawn up by the environmental protection departments of the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments in conjunction with relevant departments of the same level after consulting with the local people 's governments concerned and be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's government for approval .  
Among them , the total discharge volume control plans for water bodies that cut across provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal boundaries shall be determined by the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned through consultation .  
Article 20 Conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water that cut across provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal boundaries shall be delimited through consultation among the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned .

In the event of their failure in delimitation through consultation , the environmental protection department of the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government , in conjunction with the water resources , land and natural resources , health , construction , and other relevant departments of the same level , shall propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
Particularly , the activities of national separatist organizations are getting brisker and brisker .  These organizations manage to sell weapons and narcotics , train terrorists , and even stand for fighting a " holy war . "  Their terrorist and violent nature has become conspicuous with each passing day , thus seriously threatening the regional peace and stability as well as the people 's life and property safety .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
James Gradoville , a member of the delegation and Motorola regional director of Asia-Pacific government relations , told our reporters : We have consistently emphasized to members of Congress that it should pass a " clean resolution , without strings , " to enable American business to benefit from the opening up of the China market and enable Chinese enterprises to move toward the world still better ; at the same time this will provide a new and powerful motive force for spurring the steady and healthy development of Sino-US relations .  
Ethnic conflicts , territorial disputes , and war have been continuous in the Mideast over many years , with the result that countless people have been plunged into an abyss of misery and so many families have become destitute and homeless in all the countries of the region ; this has had a serious impact on regional economic and social development and also on world peace and stability .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan held talks here today with Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa , Minister of External Relations of Mongolia . The two sides exchanged views in a cordial and friendly atmosphere on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern , and reached a common understanding over a wide range of issues .  
Under the dual impact of the two tidal waves of world economic globalization and regional blocs formation , Taiwan 's hope of sustained , stable economic development lies in the mainland of the motherland , without which Taiwan 's economic development would certainly be faced with a predicament .  A Taiwan economy that is separated from the mainland of the motherland will have no way out and will sink and emerge alternately and struggle to survive in the flood tide of world economic globalization .  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
Relevant State Council departments and provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments are responsible for giving guidance to their subordinate regular schools of higher learning designated to train cadres for the military .  
Provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments and relevant State Council departments should clarify the responsibilities of their subordinate functional departments and strengthen guidance for their subordinate regular schools of higher learning to train high-quality personnel for the military .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
In order to protect the safety of some particularly important or vital economic targets which bear heavily on our national or regional security , aside from employing all sorts of passive or comprehensive protection measures , we must also more vigorously build an active air defense system by focusing on the issues concerned .  
In particular , we should closely integrate our plans for protecting certain extremely important economic targets with our national territorial air defense plans , our regional air defense plans , and our urban defense plans ; should give full scope to the might of our air defense arms system ; and should intercept or annihilate the air raid arms of the enemy so as to reduce the pressure on our passive defense and ensure the safety or enhance the survival capability of our vital economic targets .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
As a friendly neighbor of ASEAN and a partner of mutual trust and cooperation , China has had a high regard all along for the positive role that ASEAN plays in regional affairs , respecting ASEAN 's efforts to establish a peaceful , free , and neutral region , supporting ASEAN 's economic integration , and hoping to consolidate and expand the multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in the areas of economics and trade , science and technology , and society , etc . "  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
Therefore , the two sides will continue maintaining the momentum of high-level intercourse and contacts , deepening the mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological realms , strengthening the omni-directional exchange and cooperation in all realms , and improve the communication and coordination in international and regional affairs .  
However , as Sichuan is an interior province with a large population , a weak economic foundation , an unreasonable economic structure , and an uneven condition of regional development , it is still below the average level of the whole country 's economic growth , and still lags behind the coastal areas in the east .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
Let us jointly hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , under the leadership of the autonomous regional party committee and government and by making good use of the vigorous momentum of large-scale western development , forge ahead courageously and create more dazzling new splendors of economic and social development .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
China firmly adhered to its peaceful diplomacy of independence and self-determination , strongly advocated multipolarization in the world , and positively dealt with economic globalization .  It actively participated in regional cooperation and worked hard at creating a new international economic order that is fair and reasonable .  It devoted itself to just causes that promoted mankind 's peace and development .  
and the leaders of regional organizations .  President Jiang Zemin put forward a four-point proposal at the meeting designed to strengthen Sino-African cooperation and promote the creation of a new international economic and political order .  His proposal won universal praise from those in attendance .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Faced with an ever-worsening internal and external security situation , Russia has carried out readjustments to its diplomatic line and pursued a more active and pragmatic foreign policy , in a bid to restore Russia 's great power status and its influential role in world and regional affairs .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
Deputy Guo Jinlong said : To implement the economic and social objectives set by the autonomous regional party committee for the coming five years , the cadres and people of all nationalities in Tibet will work hard in the six aspects : First , further break seclusion , improve service , and create a good investment soft environment with innovations in thinking and structure as the guide .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
Jiang Zemin also extended congratulations to the newly formed Thai Government and expressed his appreciation of the Thai Government 's active attitude toward developing friendly relations with China . He said : China supports Thailand 's stand to promote friendly cooperation with its neighbors and to facilitate regional dialogue and cooperation .  Jiang Zemin said he believes that Thailand will play a positive role for regional peace , stability and development .  
During his visit , he held separate meetings with President Bush , Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld , and Rice , assistant to the President for national security affairs .  They exchanged views in a frank , sincere , and in-depth way on Sino-US relations and some important international and regional issues .  
They briefed each other on their respective domestic situations and had an extensive exchange of views on further developing the relations of friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two countries of China and DPRK , on regional and international relations , and on other issues of common concern .  
Qian Qichen said : China and the United States have important common interests and assume a heavy responsibility in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and world peace and stability , preventing proliferation of mass killing weapons and vehicles for carrying them , ensuring regional and global economic stability and prosperity , and coping with international threats .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said at today 's news conference that Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , during his visit to the United States , made extensive contact with the US side and exchanged views with the US side in a frank , sincere , and extensive manner on Sino-US relations and some important international and regional issues .  The visit achieved positive and constructive results .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : Countries in East Asia and Latin American are mostly developing countries .  They have common interests and tasks .  They are all exploring a path of development commensurate with their own national conditions and seeking a regional cooperation model in conformity with their own actual conditions , and striving to usher in a more stable , equal , and fair world .  We have a common wish to use each other 's experience as reference , learn from each other , and cooperate with each other .  
The conference was attended by provincial , autonomous regional , municipal , and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps party committee secretaries , deputy secretaries in charge of political-legal work , political-legal committee secretaries , court presidents , chief procurators , public security department ( bureau ) directors , and directors of offices for comprehensive tackling of public order ;  
Personalities here believe that the benign interaction of the Chinese and Australian senior military officers will be beneficial to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries and armies and to maintaining regional security as well .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his firm belief that constant strengthening of Sino-Brazil relations not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and their people , but also conforms to the common interests of the large numbers of developing countries , and definitely will make positive contributions to lasting regional and world peace and prosperity .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is pursuing an independent foreign policy to safeguard national independence and sovereignty .  It actively takes part in international and regional affairs and promotes the integration of Latin America . It has made due contributions to world peace and development .  Here I would like to express my deep appreciation and extend my sincere congratulations .  I wish the Venezuelan people more brilliant successes in their journey ahead .  
The two sides carried out frequent exchanges at various levels , and raised economic and trade cooperation to a new stage .  In regional and international affairs , the two countries also maintained close cooperation .  A favorable tendency exists in the development of Sino-Vietnamese relations .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
7 .  Both sides confirm that they hold identical or similar views and stands on major international and regional issues at present and are willing to strengthen the two countries ' close cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and make joint efforts toward establishing new international political and economic orders that are just and rational .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
He said : China and Malaysia have maintained frequent mutual visits and contacts between the senior officials and continued to maintain close coordination and cooperation in the international and regional affairs .  
He expected that during his visit , he will have an in-depth exchange of views with Moroccan leaders on bilateral ties and major international and regional issues of common concern .  He believed that this visit will actively help consolidate and promote bilateral friendly cooperative ties .  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
Having studied some burning issues in the current international and regional situation , the foreign ministers confirm in the joint communiqu ? that they have the same position and pledge to jointly commit to the further reinforcement and continuous improvement of the cooperation among the " Shanghai Five " in international affairs .  
The foreign ministers stress that the international prestige of the " Shanghai Five " has been enhanced and it has become an increasingly influential positive factor in safeguarding regional and world peace , security , and stability .  It is also playing an important role in promoting the multipolarization of the world and establishing a new international political and economic order that is fair , reasonable , and democratic .  
The comrades in charge of pertinent departments and units under the party 's central committee and State Council and the Beijing-based comrades in charge of the backbone enterprises managed by the central authorities attended the meeting at the main conference hall .  The leading comrades from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and those from various prefectural ( city ) and county people 's governments and relevant departments attended the meeting at sub-meeting-rooms .  
With the exception of the regulations regarding change and revocation of applicable regulations in Articles 6 through 9 of these regulations , the principal responsible person and signatory of a local people 's government or its subsidiary department acting in violation of these regulations or formulating and implementing regulations that stipulate implementation of regional blockades or contain reference to regional blockades shall be given disciplinary sanctions of either demotion or dismissal in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense .  
Fees and other illegitimate income received through implementation of regional blockades as a result of abuse of administrative authority by a local people 's government or its subsidiary departments shall be returned to the applicable enterprise , other economic organization or individual ;  
Personnel of a local people 's government or its subsidiary departments who retaliate by making a false charge against a unit or individual that reports regional blockade activities shall be punished by either demotion or dismissal , up to discharge from public employment , in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense ;  
Governments and departments concerned nationwide must unify their understanding , strictly enforce orders and prohibitions , and make concerted efforts to resolutely break down the " fences " of regional blockades and establish and perfect a nationally unified great market of fair competition and regulated order .  
Apart from the fact that the mental concepts of certain cadres are outdated and they long for the stuff of planned economy , an important reason why regional blockades persist in some areas despite repeated prohibition is that instead of doing their work in a thoroughly sound way , certain leading cadres depend on improper methods such as regional blockades to pursue " achievements in their official career , " and do not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the masses and the state for the sake of pursuing their own benefit .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
Comrades in charge of pertinent departments under central and state organs , comrades assigned to take charge of the work from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and persons in charge of the people 's governments at prefectural , city , and county levels participated in the conference .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
fifth , the US decision to link NMD with TMD overseas is bound to harm regional peace and stability ; should the United States being Taiwan into the east Asia TMD , this will be organizing a US-Taiwan military alliance in disguise , interfering in China 's internal affairs , and increasing the tension in the Taiwan strait .  
In the future , both sides of the strait should keep in mind regional union and national reunification , eliminate political interference from separatist forces , work to promote reciprocity and mutual benefit for both sides of the strait in economics and trade , and create a new win-win and mutually beneficial situation of cooperation and exchange .  
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
He expressed the belief that , with close cooperation and unremitting efforts of both sides , the Sino-Thai relations of good neighborliness , mutual trust , and all-round cooperation will grow in strength in the coming century , which is not only beneficial to the two peoples , but also conducive to regional peace and development .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .

People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .

However , before deciding on the matter , the standing committees concerned should solicit views from the members of the party committees concerned .  
President Akayev said cheerfully that the fact that the fruitful activities of the " Shanghai Five " in recent years have drawn the attention of the international community has a lot to do with its growing international prestige in the region and in the world , with our successful solution of problems in the political , military , economic , trade and other spheres , and with the tremendous role we are playing in the protection of regional security .  
Shi Guangsheng : The Foreign Trade Minister meeting is an important routine meeting of APEC that is held once every year .  Ministers and officials of every member state hold discussions and seek mutual understanding on major issues impacting global and Asia-Pacific regional economic and trade development .  The meeting serves as preparation for the Joint Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministerial meeting and the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting scheduled to be held at the end of this year .  
Supported by a total of nine regional operational control centers ( ROCC ) , including a temporary center commissioned in Iceland in 1988 , the JSS system has deployed a sensor-surveillance network , comprising a total of 85 radar , including 47 on the US territory , which are capable of monitoring areas 320 kilometers wide on the US territory and in the surrounding areas . 
Your distinguished nation has pursued a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping initiative in one 's own hands , has protected world peace and promoted joint progress , and has played an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs .  
The meeting of ministers responsible for trade among APEC member economies and the discussions on major issues concerning regional and global economic and trade development are of major significance for the maintenance of a stable and open economic and trade environment in this region and the establishment of a fair and rational new world economic order .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
Now , financial and economic officials , while continuing to uphold the " no haste , be patient " policy , have pledged that Taiwan " will become a center , not a springboard " .  How can they expect to rebuild the people 's confidence with the slogan that they will " work desperately hard for the economy " when their basic logics for regional economy are self-contradictory ?  
The development and change of the post-Cold War international security situation shows that apart from cooperative security mechanism , the other mechanisms have not played or will also impossibly play , in the real terms , the role as patron saint in regional security , because the security based on those mechanisms is built on the basis of the others ' insecurity and is the refurbished version of the historical old security mechanism with hegemonist coloration .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
It has provided a good example , which shows that all countries , large or small , can carry out regional cooperation on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit .  It has demonstrated that showing mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences is the only choice for countries with different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to live with each other in peace and harmony and achieve common prosperity .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
The " Shanghai Five " mechanism advocates good neighborly relations , mutual trust , equality , mutual benefits , unity , cooperation , and joint development .  It has provided the international community with valuable experience and inspiration in abandoning the Cold War mentality and in actively exploring for a new type of state-to-state relations , a new type of security view , and a new type of regional cooperation model in the post-Cold War era , and has made positive contributions to world peace and stability .  
Raidi , deputy secretary of the regional party committee , chairman of the standing committee of the regional people 's congress and first deputy head of the regional leading group for studying the important thinking of the " three represents " , summarized five special characteristics of this region in studying the " three represents " .  They are : 1 ) Party committees at various levels have attached great importance to studying the " three represents " and made effective and meticulous arrangements for promoting the education ;  
Speak highly of the positive role that the " Shanghai Five " has played with respect to promoting and deepening good neighborliness , mutual trust , and friendly relations ; and to consolidating regional security and stability and promoting common development between member countries ever since its establishment five years ago ;  
The ministers held that the fruitful military cooperation between the SCO member states sets a good example of a new kind of regional military cooperation suitable to modern trends in the post-Cold War era .  It is not only conducive to promoting long-term and healthy development of friendly relations and cooperation between SCO member states , but also of great significance to safeguarding regional and world peace and stability .  
The ministers unanimously agree that the fruitful military cooperation based on that of the " Shanghai Five " has set an example for establishing new-type regional military cooperation commensurate with the trend of the times after the Cold War , which is not only conducive to promoting the long-term healthy development of the friendly and cooperative relations among the member nations of the " Shanghai Cooperation Organization " but also is of great significance to maintaining peace and stability in the region and even the world at large .  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The signing of the treaty not only will reflect the common desire of the two peoples for friendship from generation to generation , but also will show the development of friendly , comprehensive and mutually beneficial [ you hao quan mian hu li ] relations between China and Russia conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples , and is conducive to maintaining regional and world peace , stability and development .  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin mentioned that it is necessary to uphold and perfect the system of people 's congress , the multiparty cooperation system under the leadership of the communist party , and the system of political consultation and regional national autonomy , actively , safely , and steadily push forward the reform of political structure , further expand the democracy of socialism , govern the country according to law , and build a socialist country ruled by law .  
This is a wise choice based on our national condition ; it has enabled us , when regional and world economic turbulence occur , to successfully guard against financial risks , avoid huge losses , and safeguard national economic security .  
She said : During the visit , President Jiang Zemin and President Putin will exchange views on a wide-range of current major and pressing regional and international issues , in order to make concerted efforts to safeguard global strategic balance and stability .  
Zanoun said : China 's righteous stance on international and regional affairs has been highly appreciated by the Arab states , including the Palestinian people .  China is the most reliable friend of the Arab people .  Palestine expects China to play an even greater role in halting the current bloody conflicts between Israel and Palestine and in bringing about an all-round , fair , and reasonable solution to the Middle East issue soon .  
In the face of the worst flood since the founding of New China , leading members of the Guangxi regional party committee and the regional government personally went to the front line to direct the work of combating the flood .

After overcoming various kinds of difficulties , they built more than 10 kilometers of auxiliary dikes within two days .  
Diplomats of the two countries disclosed that Jiang Zemin and Putin will hold a summit meeting to exchange their views on the current international situation , major global and regional issues , including the US claim to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its readiness to build the national missile defense system .  The two heads of state will reiterate their stands clarified during the " Shanghai Five " summit in June this year , namely , Putin stressed that Russia firmly safeguarded the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to prevent a new round of arms race ;  
In the field of regional issues , the two sides emphasized the adoption of active and effective measures to crack down on national splittist , international terrorist , religious extremist , and transnational criminal activities .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
Governments at all levels should have the resolve and should take strong measures against the illegal activities of manufacturing and selling counterfeit and shoddy goods , outlaw all places used for manufacturing and selling counterfeit goods , smash narrow-minded local protectionism and regional economic blockade , smash the monopoly of industries and trades , establish unified national markets , encourage enterprises to compete by fair means , and give shape to a market competition mechanism in real terms by which only the best will survive .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
Since coming to power , the Bush administration has stressed seeking " absolute security " for the US and attached importance to the " potential challenges " posed by regional powers .  Communist Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have on many occasions expressed concern in private about the Bush administration 's moves .  They are worried that this tough " Bushism " which is taking shape on the international scene would cast a shadow on the development of Sino-US relations .  
They also had an in-depth exchange of opinions on current major and urgent regional and international issues , thus reaching a broad consensus .  One of the most important results is that President Jiang and President Putin have signed the Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness , Friendship , and Cooperation . The treaty is permeated with peaceful thinking that the two countries will remain friends from generation to generation and never become enemies .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
Up to now , the navies of some middle class countries are equipped with light class carriers , with costs varying from $ 300-500-million , and while this class of carrier can fulfill some regional combat missions , they can not handle the naval formations of strong nations , so this class of carrier would have no practical significance for the Chinese navy .  
Raidi emphatically pointed out : Although the Western hostile forces have clung to their ambitious designs of splitting Tibet from China , and the task to fight against " Tibet independence " is still vary arduous , the autonomous regional government has confidence that it will overcome all obstacles , accelerate economic development and social progress in Tibet , and raise the people 's living standard .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .  
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
At 22:40 the same day , we drove to Hechi City where the regional leading group in charge of investigating incident was located .  We learned from the leading group 's principal leader that 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident .  
Taking the forthcoming four-country meeting of Chinese , Laotian , Myanmar , and Thai ministers on narcotics control as a turning point and acting according to the current mechanisms of international and regional anti-drug cooperation , we will continue to strengthen our cooperation with neighboring countries in narcotics control , prevent , crack down on , and bring under control narcotic and drug-related crimes , and strive to build sound and civilized public order and to eventually fulfill the long-term target of total prohibition of all narcotic drugs .  
In former years Japanese militarism launched wars of aggression against China , causing the Chinese people profound suffering , but for the sake of Asia-Pacific regional peace and stability , China has proposed the guideline of " take history as a mirror and look ahead " in its foreign relations with Japan , and has worked with Japan to build an enduringly stable , good neighborly , and friendly cooperative partnership .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
Zhu Bangzao said : During his visits , Foreign Minister Tang will extensively exchange views with leaders of the four countries on further strengthening bilateral relations as well as on international and regional issues of common concern , to achieve the objective of enhancing mutual understanding , deepening friendship , widening consensus , and promoting cooperation .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
Zhu Bangzao said : The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on further strengthening diverse cooperative relations between China and the four countries in the political , economic , trade , and cultural fields , and on international and regional issues , such as the establishment of a new international political and economic order , the Middle East issue , the Gulf situation , and the Iraq issue .  They reached broad consensus .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
Sun Yuxi said : President Jiang 's upcoming visits will be an important diplomatic move made by China at the turn of the century .  The purpose of the visits are to step up high-level exchange between China and the aforementioned six countries , ensure further development of bilateral relations , and exchange views with them on the current international situation and the situations in regions of concern , in order to enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation on international and regional affairs .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .  From the period when he was known as " Liuzhou tyrant " to the period when he served as a leader of the regional party committee and government , Liu sought illegal interests and made things convenient for his wife and children by abusing power .  He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
President Jiang 's current visits to the six countries is China 's important diplomatic action at the turn of the century aimed at strengthening high-level contacts between China and the above-mentioned six countries to further develop their bilateral ties and exchange views on the international and relevant regional situation .  The visits will increase their mutual understanding and enhance their cooperation in international and regional affairs .

Through this round of visits , China has strengthened high-level contacts with the nations concerned , promoted the further development of bilateral relations with them , enhanced mutual understanding with them , and strengthened cooperation with them in international and regional affairs .  
Therefore , the task of narrowing the development gap between the western and eastern regions to bring about regional economic and social revitalization and prosperity can not be accomplished with just one or two five-year plans or a 10-year program .  The task can only be eventually achieved through long-term and ceaseless efforts of many generations .  
Having built a batch of national-level and provincial-level professional seismic stations , regional remote forecast networks , seismic stations run by localities or enterprises , as well as monitoring points run by the masses , our country has established an earthquake monitoring system with Chinese characteristics , which integrates the efforts of professionals with those of the masses .  Our legal system building for the purpose of preventing earthquakes and reducing disasters has also made marked headway .  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .

We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Albright also said that the months ahead will be very " substantial and busy " days in Sino-US relations .  She said : The US Senate will vote in early July on according China the permanent normal trade relations status ; I myself will meet Chinese foreign minister again in late July during the ASEAN regional forum period ; President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin will hold a meeting in September while they attend the UN millenium meeting of heads of state .

the layout of rural medical and health care institutions will be readjusted , with the current layout based on administrative regional division being changed ; all existing medical and health care facilities will be put under unified management in the whole trade ; in the same township , the health care station and the guiding station for family planning can share resources .  
At today 's [ 9 March , 2001 ] news conference , when answering a reporter 's question on whether the regional security will be affected by the China 's increased budget for national defense expenditure this year , the Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao indicated : The persons using this to allege that the regional security will probably be threatened by China 's increased national defense spending utterly have an ulterior motive .  I am afraid they have other fish to fry .  
CPPCC National Committee Member Huang Guancong held that since China has a large territory with its different parts keeping their own special characteristics , it is necessary to scientifically study and reasonably plan out the program of construction of small cities and towns , based on scientific feasibility studies and in light of each locality 's regional and local strong points and weaknesses , resource availability , and population condition .  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
On the eve of the " two sessions , " the NPC Standing Committee approved the decision to amend the Regional National Autonomy Law , thus extensively overhauling the Regional National Autonomy Law adopted in 1984 .  In the original foreword , " regional national autonomy " was defined as " a major political system of the state . "  Now it is defined as " a basic political system of the state , " which fully expresses the nationality policy of the party and the government .  
Most of the latest amendments have to do with the economic system and demonstrate the support and aid of state organs at the higher levels for the autonomous regions .  They are designed to resolve a number of practical problems in economic and social development in minority autonomous areas and should help accelerate economic and social development in those areas and help promote national unity and perfect the regional national autonomy system . "  
Luo Gan said : The Chinese party and government have always attached great importance to developing good neighborliness , friendship , and all-round cooperation with Vietnam , regarding the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and two countries as not only the demand for invigorating the Chinese national economy and promoting reform and the socialist modernization drive , but also the demand for maintaining regional peace and the peace of the world at large and advancing the cause of human progress .  
The General Office of the Ministry of Education the other day issued a circular among various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal education departments , in which it discussed an explosion incident , which broke out in a teaching building of a primary school in Jiangxi a week ago , and urged education departments in all areas as well as all types of schools at all levels to immediately take action to introduce a security and prevention system in schools so as to create favorable conditions for guaranteeing young people 's healthy growth .  
Only by conscientiously implementing the party 's policy towards minority nationalities and put into effect the regional national autonomy can the equal rights of different minority nationalities , as well as the right of autonomy in national autonomous areas , be fully protected ; can the enthusiasm of the people of different ethnic groups be fully aroused ; and can a common prosperity be brought true among different nationalities .  
Meanwhile , the province will also give prominence to the region 's key development areas , develop an economy that enjoys distinct regional characteristics , speed up the development of the Chengdu plain , carry out a comprehensive exploration of resources in the Panxi area , boost the construction and development of the areas in southern Sichuan , give more assistance to areas inhabited by minority nationalities , and extend vigorous support to the development of both hilly areas and the Penzhou mountain areas .  
After the peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the central government and the autonomous regional government , a grand total of over 5.2 billion yuan was invested in Lhasa 's urban construction .  
Guo Jinlong , secretary of the autonomous regional party committee , who is attending the current NPC session as a non-voting delegate , stated : The " two supremes " work reports have both placed in the front and the center work like cracking down on hostile forces or safeguarding reunification of the motherland , and this fully conforms with Tibet 's realities and gives us tremendous encouragement and support , for Tibet is in the forefront of the struggle against separatism .  
In addition , it is imperative to keep to and make perfect the regional autonomous system for ethnic minorities so as to develop the socialist relations among different ethnic groups marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance and enable them to achieve common prosperity and progress .  
Picula gave a briefing on the latest development of the regional situation in southeast Europe where Croatia is located , said Croatia is deeply disturbed by the armed conflicts that have broken out recently in Kosovo and Macedonia , and hoped the existing problems will be solved politically through a peaceful approach .  
the WTO requires various member countries , whether large or small , to implement the principle of nondiscriminating trade treatment ; a legal system and good market order are a regular way to attract international investment , especially investment from transnational corporations , and the practice of relying on preferential policies and special regional treatment to attracting foreign investment will be no longer effective ;  
However , there exist in varying degrees trade monopoly , regional blockade , coercive trade , discriminative treatment , and other problems , which have cut the market apart , restricted fair competition , and disrupted market order as well .  
" Because of Hong Kong 's excellent infrastructure , robust financial market and its role as an international business hub , " said Mr Ho , " many overseas investors who wish to enter the Chinese market often finds it desirable to have a Hong Kong partner or to set up a regional office in Hong Kong . "  
" By bringing together companies from other economies , researchers in our tertiary institutions and local enterprises with scientific and technological competence , the science park will provide a major impetus for the development of indigenous science and technology-based companies in Hong Kong , " he said , adding that it would also promote technology transfer by attracting overseas investment and enhance regional co-operation in this area .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
We held an Environmental Awareness Seminar for our senior staff in the City Hall in October 1997 , enlisting assistance from external expert key speakers .  The purpose was to introduce to our staff the total concept of protecting the environment from global , regional , local and management perspectives .  
Details are given on recent statistical development in various areas , including population ; labour ; industry , distribution and services ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; urban and regional services ; water supplies ; and the environment . 
I am confident that , with our strong fundamentals , coupled with our flexibility of adaptation to external shock , and with the extent of price and cost adjustment that our free market economy has allowed us to go through up to now , our economy should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums , once the regional situation has settled , and our outlook beyond that remains bright . 
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the sharp decline in retail sales in May 1998 reflected the further weakening in consumer sentiment upon renewed regional instability during the month .  May was marked by the occurrence of some negative events with particularly wide repercussions for the region including Hong Kong .  
In short , our commitment to an open and free market and to the linked exchange rate system is paramount .  We will be vigilant in safeguarding them .  And we will make sure they will continue to work well to the benefit of the public and all local and overseas investors even when external economic conditions are turbulent .  It is our duty to the local community and to the stability of the regional markets .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
Speaking after a ' warm and cordial ' bilateral meeting with Singapore 's Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong , the Chief Executive said he valued constant dialogue to reinforce ties between Hong Kong and Singapore . " We attach great importance to close co-operation with all our regional partners in trade and economic matters , " said Mr Tung , who is in Malaysia for the annual APEC Economic Leaders Meetings tomorrow ( Tuesday ) and Wednesday . 
The dialogue on the financial crisis covered several topics , which included the strengthening of financial and legal systems , recapitalising banks affected by bad debts , the use of savings to build domestic bond and securities markets and ways to guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
The spokesman explained that the distinct narrowing in the visible trade deficit in 1998 reflected the adjustment in domestic demand upon the impact of the regional financial turmoil , which led to a marked decline in imports retained for local use .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
A stable and efficient debt market provides an effective avenue for Governments and enterprises to raise capital .  It is critical to the steady development of the financial industries as well as to the overall stability of the regional economies .  
For applications of similar quality that meet the above conditions , Mr Kwong said the following factor would be considered favourably : potential tenants in the information services sector which bring to Hong Kong their head office or regional headquarters , the level of investment per square metre over the first five years of tenancy , and the percentage of head-count in the Cyberport employing professional and technical staff .  
The existing 60 VIRs , all of which have become operational , are located at different bureaux , regional crime units and most major divisional stations for interviewing persons involved in cases which are likely to be heard in the District Court or the Court of First Instance .  
Details are given on recent statistical development in various areas , including population ; labour ; industry , distribution and services ; prices and household expenditure ; external trade ; national accounts ; money , banking and finance ; strategic planning ; education ; housing ; medical and health ; social welfare ; law and order ; transport ; community information ; urban and regional services ; water supplies ; and the environment . 
The Summit , to be held between October 18 - 20 , will be attended by leading political figures within and outside the region , as well as some 800 business leaders representing major multinational companies and prominent regional corporations .  
Mr Yam identified the areas to be considered for the building of a stronger financial system as : prudent management of the international financial architecture , international reform in financial disclosure and regulation , and regional monetary co-operation .  
In that short period , many crucial legal issues have been addressed .  These include the status of the Provisional Legislative Council , the adaptation of laws programme , the criminal jurisdiction of Mainland courts over cross-boundary activities , the right of abode issue , and the constitutionality of laws protecting the national and regional flags .  
As the local and regional economic environment stabilised , Hong Kong recorded a further BoP surplus amounting to $ 1.9 billion , equivalent to 0.6% of GDP , in the second quarter of 1999 .  
As Hong Kong 's exports improved along with the regional economic recovery and as the slack domestic demand continued to hold back imports retained for local use , the visible trade deficit narrowed further , from $ 8.8 billion in the first quarter of 1999 to $ 7.4 billion in the second quarter .  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
In federations , such as the United States of America , Australia and Canada , legislative power is divided between the central and regional governments .  Almost invariably , the central government is empowered to legislate on a wide range of subject matters , and the powers of regional governments are restricted .  
This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
" I believe that a deep and liquid regional market is one way that we can help alleviate the risks of sudden , erratic and sometimes huge international capital flows into and out of specific markets .  
While earnings from Hong Kong 's direct investment abroad continued to rise markedly upon the sustained regional recovery , there was additional investment income from acquisition of overseas enterprises by some multinational enterprise groups during the period . 
Exports of services also surged on the back of the robust regional demand , yielding a substantial invisible trade surplus of $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , considerably enlarged from that of $ 14.8 billion in the same quarter in 1999 .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 66.7 billion and $ 65.3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 over the preceding quarter , reflecting the much improved regional and local investment situation upon the economic revival .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .  
Within the total factor income inflow , direct investment income ( DII ) recorded a substantial increase of 26.9% in the second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier , reflecting that the earnings from Hong Kong 's direct investment abroad continued to rise markedly upon the sustained regional recovery . 
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 78.5 billion and $ 137.1 billion during the second quarter of 2000 , reflecting the improved regional and local investment environment upon the economic revival .  
Within the total factor income inflow , direct investment income ( DII ) increased by 10.7% in the third quarter of 2000 over a year earlier , reflecting the continued improvement in investment returns from abroad upon the regional economic recovery . 
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased , by $ 34.4 billion and $ 56.3 billion respectively during the third quarter of 2000 , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
While conceding that there may not be a single quick fix strategy to turn Hong Kong into a regional innovation and technology hub , Mr Ho was confident that the Government 's continued commitment , coupled with a focused approach and pragmatic programmes to lay a sound foundation , would help Hong Kong develop towards this end .  
Hong Kong is developing into a major regional hub of electronic commerce , with liberalized and well-established telecommunications infrastructure , a culture embracing information technology and new innovations , close relationship with the Mainland , and successful cooperation between the public and private sector in driving infrastructural and technological developments .  
What is particularly encouraging is that between 1999 and 2000 , the number of regional headquarters and offices established by multinational corporations in Hong Kong increased from 2,500 to 3,000 ; Hong Kong is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Asia after Mainland China , amounting to US $ 23.1 billion last year .  
( c ) The HKPC is to fulfil its public mission to promote the productivity of industry in Hong Kong through providing low-return supporting services which see a lack of participation by the private sector , conducting market development research and organising promotional activities for various trades , providing services to small and medium enterprises , and liaising with relevant regional and international organisations .  The Government , therefore , has no plan to change the funding arrangements for the HKPC to make it operate on a self-financing basis .  
Invest Hong Kong , the government body charged with attracting foreign investment to Hong Kong , is targeting major corporations and leading businesses that are considering expanding into Asia . Helping them spread the message that Hong Kong is where they should base their regional operations is " Spirit of Hong Kong " , the 72-foot yacht taking part in the grueling BT Global Challenge race . 
Both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased markedly in 2000 , by $ 491.1 billion and $ 502.1 billion respectively , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .  China has given prominence to the development of science , technology and education , accelerated the informatization of national economic and social progress , strengthened environmental protection , expedited township development and improved public service system .  
At the annual meeting , member jurisdictions discussed a wide range of issues , including economic implications of money laundering , global anti-money laundering initiatives and the regional response , APG mutual evaluations , and current and future typologies work on money laundering methods .  
The annual meeting was attended by over 200 senior officials from central banks , financial regulatory bodies , and legal , financial and law enforcement agencies of member and observer jurisdictions , as well as representatives from international and regional organisations , including the Asian Development Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the United Nations and the World Customs Organization .  
" Our strengths in financial services and professional skills - management , accounting , legal services , consulting , marketing and international sourcing , couple with our excellent air , sea and telecommunications infrastructure , underline our role as a leading regional and international hub as the world goes to China , the mother of all emerging markets in the 21st century , " he added .  
Some 3 000 overseas companies have established their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong . Two years ago we attracted the second highest amount of external direct investment in Asia , just behind the Mainland and far exceeding other places in Asia . That figure increased more than 1.5 times last year .  China 's accession to the World Trade Organisation is expected to add impetus to this momentum .  
" As stated by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address this year , the Government is fully committed to providing a conducive environment and the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the development and promotion of Hong Kong as the preferred international and regional transportation and logistics hub , as well as a base for coordinating and integrating service providers for the global and regional demand and supply chain , " Mr Leung added .  
Its good legal , exchange rate , taxation and regulatory environments , coupled with its excellent professional services , have made it especially well suited for regional headquarters and regional offices .  In addition , Hong Kong will remain firm in its position as a financial centre .  
Looking ahead , we will further develop the depth and width of our bond market .  We are forging the bilateral linkage with Euroclear with a view to promoting cross-boundary custody and clearing of Hong Kong and overseas bonds , and at the same time expanding the base of investors , thereby stimulating the growth of both local and regional bond markets .  We will also develop our CMU into an international clearing house , so that Hong Kong will become the central clearing house in Asia . This will strengthen our status as an international financial centre .  
The Home Affairs Bureau and Leisure and Cultural Services Department have commissioned a consultancy firm in mid November 2001 to conduct a study on the Provision of Regional / District Cultural and Performance Facilities in Hong Kong ( the Study ) , which aims to identify the community 's long-term needs and to rationalize the provision of existing cultural and performance facilities at the regional / district level to facilitate future planning . 
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis . They were ( i ) fiscal policy in good and bad times ; ( ii ) financial systems and corporate governance ; ( iii ) exchange rate systems ; and ( iv ) potential regional economic arrangements for Asia .  
CNBC , the foremost global provider of business and financial information and TNT , the world 's leading business logistics solutions company , today ( May 23 ) announced the launch of the Asia Business Leader Awards 2002 , the prestigious annual honour that recognises achievement , innovation and leadership in regional business .  
While core infrastructure projects completed in the last five years have enhanced the competitive edge of Hong Kong as a major regional business and transportation hub , the HKSAR Government 's commitment to invest C $ 120 billion in future infrastructure developments will ensure that Hong Kong will continue to be a world-class business city with a pleasant living environment for its citizens and visitors . 
China 's WTO accession has accentuated the problems of non-competitive SOE 's , including large portfolios of non-performing loans ; mounting public debt ; a sizable pension deficit ; regional polarities with rising unemployment and labour redundancies ; continued efforts in strengthening a law-based business environment with a higher level of consistency and corporate governance ; the demand for more investment capital ; and the need for more training and re-training in the skills and expertise for international businesses . 
Members of the audience were fascinated by the stylish performance that featured bold and energetic art style of the northern land .  Heilongjiang Province Song and Dance Theatre is a well-established provincial-level performing group .  Since its establishment in 1954 , the Theatre has produced and performed folk music and dance programmes with rich regional flavour , and has won the national Wenhua Award .  
The Summit , to be held from October 6 to 8 , will be attended by leading political figures within and outside the region , as well as business leaders representing major multinational companies and prominent regional corporations .  
The Summit , held from October 6 to 8 , is attended by leading political figures within and outside the region , as well as business leaders representing major multinational companies and prominent regional corporations .  
The two Governments have agreed to consider in detail the enhanced control measures recommended in the report of a joint study on regional air quality completed earlier this year and , having regard to their feasibility , implement a series of additional measures with the objective of achieving the agreed emission reduction targets by 2010 .  
The favourable ratings given to the five most important factors - low and simple tax system ; political stability and security ; free flow of information ; rule of law and independent judiciary ; and corruption-free government - point to why Hong Kong remains the preferred location for regional operations in this region .  
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .  
We will step up efforts to promote the economic potential of Hong Kong and the PRD . We will actively open up new markets , bringing in more foreign capital , attracting foreign talent , and encouraging more multinational corporations to set up their regional headquarters in Hong Kong .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
The company is the world 's largest specialized provider of discount hotel accommodations .  The Managing Director ( Asia Pacific ) of Hotels.com , Mr Bill Edward , said today ( March 10 ) : " The free and business-friendly economy , the ideal geographical location with easy access to China and the skilled workforce were also crucial to locating our regional headquarters here . "  
The Government also monitors the local pump prices of unleaded petrol and ultra low sulphur diesel against monthly average Singapore FOB prices ( the generally accepted regional benchmark for pricing in the Asia Pacific Region ) .  
For instance , to optimise the use of resources , the Immigration Department proposed a reorganisation of its regional offices , including closure of certain less cost-effective marriage registries and births and deaths registries .  This required the Government to amend the relevant subsidiary legislation and to consult those in the community affected by the closures to work out suitable arrangements so that the remaining offices could meet public demand for the services concerned .  
With such result and not least the tremendous effect by a very competent local staff , there is no doubt we took the right decision to set up our regional base in Hong Kong and we will continue to expand here in the coming future . " 
" With excellent business infrastructure , a highly qualified workforce , free flow of goods , capital and information and a transparent regulatory system , Hong Kong is an ideal location for retailers to establish their regional operations .  
" As the world 's freest economy and a vibrant and sophisticated international financial and business centre , Hong Kong 's strategic location and international networks , as well as experience and expertise in dealing with foreign and China business make us the preferred destination for international companies to set up their regional offices and regional headquarters . "  
Apart from partnerships with local stakeholders , the annual report gives an account of cooperation with regional and international organisations on protecting the environment .  It also looks ahead to major tasks in different aspects of the environment in the coming years .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
As a matter of fact , Hong Kong 's excellent business environment , simple and low tax regime , cosmopolitan lifestyle , superb geographical location , free economy , rule of law , skilled workforce with international vision , world class infrastructure as well as efficient and clean government are factors attracting many overseas multi-national corporations to set up their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong .  
About half a year ago , the National Science Council established a Taipei regional analytical instrument center and purchased a single crystal diffractometer for the measurement of molecular structure .  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
Chou Mi-mi director of the Revival Youth Yueh Drama Troupe , explains that the performance style of Yueh drama incorporates the best elements of Peking opera , spoken drama and folk opera . With attractive melodies and an easy to understand vernacular text , it is ideal for people of all ages and well worth preserving as a valuable example of regional opera . " I hope that the government will do more to extend a helping hand to traditional folk opera and so keep its legacy alive , " says enthusiastic proponent Chou Mi-mi . (  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
Furthermore , comic dialogue by its very nature demands close attention to oration ( of poems , tongue twisters and jokes ) , imitation ( of various regional dialects , insect noises and bird calls ) and singing ( folk ballads , regional operas , and even pop songs ) , all bound up in a comical style .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
But in regard to this question , the international community wants the cross-strait problem to be resolved peacefully . Though most countries accept the " one China " principle , and recognize the mainland regime as its representative , Taiwan 's democratic development and economic efforts have drawn great international attention and affirmation . In particular , Taiwan 's stability during the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia is evidence that Taiwan plays a critical role in ensuring the economic prosperity and regional security of East Asia .  
Because the results of research over the previous decade gradually received international affirmation , in 1989 the World Bank approved the center 's five-year plan and provided substantial funding . The number of research projects increased substantially and regional cooperation projects were successively begun .  
It hopes to raise its political status at a global level and at the Asia-Pacific regional level through the development of a high-technology operational capability . It also aims to increase its capability to deal with domestic and border area instability . Besides these , however , and of more immediate interest to Taiwan , another of the main goals behind mainland China 's new strategy is to maintain a reliable military threat to cope with Taiwan and its so-called " separatist tendencies . "  
With the end of the US-Soviet Cold War , the PRC has recognized that an enormous transformation has occurred in the global political and military structure . Bipolar confrontation has been replaced by regional or functional conflicts . Under these circumstances , middle-sized powers or regional powers can expand their international political influence .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
Consequently , over the last 100 years , the poles have seen an increase of 5 �X C in their average temperatures . Hence accelerated melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is one of the first symptoms of global warming . But climate can not be separated into discrete regional units .

The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .

The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .

This policy affirms the principles of regional cooperation and strengthens the concept of good neighbourliness , mutual respect and commitment to the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter and lay the foundations for mutual understanding based on commitment to the values of continuous exchanges of joint vital interests .  
In order to boost such development and lasting stability , there is an urgent need for concerted efforts by the international organizations and specialized agencies within the United Nations system , coupled with broader and more intensive cooperation at a regional level .  
We have drawn this issue to the attention of the Security Council , and we are confident that as a result urgent action at the national , regional and international levels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization and cooperation in the judicial , police and even intelligence spheres , in order to halt this insidious manifestation of terror .

The Organization of American States , for example , stated on 13 September that nuclear tests being carried out in the South Pacific pose a potential risk to the health and security of surrounding States and their living resources and environment , and do not take into account the precautionary principle contained in the Rio Declaration on environment and development and in other regional agreements .

I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .

Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues .

Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it .

The primary objective of this programme area is to provide assessments of the current status and trends in major developmental and environmental issues at the national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards :

Also believe that the current mandate leaves substantial room for a more assertive and effective mission by UNPROFOR and relevant regional organizations , especially bearing in mind Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , although there could be potential enhancement of the existing Security Council mandate of UNPROFOR ;  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
Encourage major groups working in the population / gender field and in other sustainable development fields to increase their communication , cooperation and coordination at the local , regional and international levels in order to reinforce their contribution to the mutual understanding of these issues and to facilitate their active participation in the implementation of chapter 5 of Agenda 21 and chapter III of the Programme of Action ;

At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
We hope that Iraq will soon be in a position to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , so that there will be no need for this mechanism and so that Iraq may resume its regional and international role in the peaceful and positive manner that would enable the brotherly people of Iraq to overcome the years of hardship and to make up for their losses in the domain of economic and social development .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
Urges the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in cooperation with the regional and other organizations where appropriate , to submit to their governing and legislative organs concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant United Nations decisions , particularly specific programmes of assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories and their national liberation movements ;

Special attention is drawn to the need for improved delivery of information to decision makers and to increased participation in environmental observations at the local and national levels within regional and international frameworks .  
The Commission noted the importance of developing , among the organizations of the United Nations system , a common or compatible system of access to their respective databases , in order to share data fully , to streamline the collection and interpretation of data and to identify data gaps , for the purpose of providing more comprehensive and integrated data to decision makers at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .

( i ) Statistical profiles by subregion ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) regional compendium of environmental statistics ; ( iii ) statistical charts on thematic topics ( 2 ) ; and ( iv ) technical publications on socio-economic and environment statistics ( 2 ) ; 
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
The main rationale for the implementation of the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community was that major prerequisites , including social stability , sustained economic development and social progress , could not be achieved by individual countries in isolation .  Major obstacles to regional cooperation and integration are the paucity or lack of financial resources to support the process .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .

That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .

Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
The continuing political impasse in the Liberian peace process is a sign of a dangerous trend , also manifested in the Liberian parties ' disregard of the numerous appeals issued by the international community and by African regional organizations , in particular the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , and of the vigorous efforts aimed at the speedy achievement of a political settlement in that country .  
The representative of ECLAC stated that at present , INSTRAW was experiencing a turning point , therefore its cooperation with the regional commissions required some analysis so that INSTRAW could significantly contribute to the regional work that was taking place ; by the same token , the regional commissions could provide support to INSTRAW 's activities , based on their knowledge of their specific regional conditions , and the regional institutions dealing with the relevant subjects .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;  
Supports the need for an extensive study to be undertaken on the economic , social and constitutional conditions in each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , as called for by the Special Committee Regional Seminar held in Vanuatu in 1990 , which should be undertaken by the relevant regional institutions .  Statement made by the Minister of Housing and Settlements ,  
They should be seen not as omnipotent decision makers and providers , as in the traditional management model , but rather as the focal point of a system that will work more effectively if it is expanded through cooperation with outside organizations and if its efficiency is enhanced through decentralization , giving more power to regional and municipal decision makers .  
With regard to the institution-building process , it was said that despite the many daily problems and challenges , the institutional development should not be carried out on an ad hoc basis , but be seen in its local , regional and national dimensions , which required strategic thinking and vision .

Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
One delegation offered three principles to expand net income from the private sector in developing countries : the income generated should be additional to the general resources country programme allocation ; the strategic importance of the decentralized operations of the regional support centres in Rio de Janeiro and Singapore should be maintained ; and there should continue to be investments from FDP .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
A regional model is a coordinated set of activities in the mental health field in a certain geographic area , each programme consists of training in post traumatic therapy and in assisting victims of sexual violence .  
Major changes have included strengthening the overarching theoretical framework to identify and refine its major human resource development components more clearly , a narrowing of focus to key practical and high-priority activities , and updating implementing arrangements to reflect changing regional circumstances .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .  
The Fifth Summit will chart ASEAN 's future direction towards intensifying political , economic and functional cooperation to make ASEAN an even more cohesive and dynamic regional grouping .  
In the meantime , in order to address the urgent problems facing the repatriation of refugees , it may be useful to convene , at the earliest possible date , a regional meeting aimed at developing concrete measures to implement the commitments embodied in the Nairobi Summit declaration of January 1995 , the Bujumbura Action Plan of February 1995 and the tripartite agreements signed by UNHCR , Rwanda and neighbouring countries hosting Rwandan refugees .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Encourage national implementation of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management and study the feasibility of further developing internationally agreed upon criteria and indicators against which progress towards sustainable forest management of all types of forests could be measured , taking into account the specific regional and subregional conditions of forests and the diversity of economic , social and cultural environments .  
Mr . PEERTHUM ( Mauritius ) said that in the context of the new alternative approaches put forward at the previous session , the need to encourage measures for cooperation in economic , scientific , technical , environmental and humanitarian fields which could contribute to regional peace and security and , where appropriate , promote regional economic activities , had been stressed .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Thus , the data and information management component of the Division of Environment Assessment is operating a computerized catalogue ( " meta-database " ) on environmental data and information , developing critical datasets for assessments and assisting and supporting national Governments , regional data networks and other programmes in their efforts to improve access to and management of relevant and meaningful data and information on the environment .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
Further proposed action included the development of a holistic normative framework to facilitate the cooperation of all concerned in meeting conflicting demands on land resources while avoiding land degradation , as well as the negotiation of regional or subregional cooperative agreements on mountains , possibly leading to the development of a global mountain charter and action plan .  
The Cook Islands suggested that the United Nations convene a meeting of the legal advisers of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of small States to discuss their role , the special operational and logistical problems they faced , inter alia , regarding participation in the multilateral treaty-making process and the fulfilment of reporting obligations , and possible means to resolve such problems through cooperation at the regional and global levels .  
Regarding protection of the marine environment , the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities , expected to be adopted at an intergovernmental conference on the subject to be held in Washington , D.C . , from 23 October to 3 November 1995 , would contribute to the effective implementation of relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and various regional maritime conventions and protocols .  
In that resolution , the General Assembly decided that the major activities for the observance of the Year should be concentrated at the local , regional and national levels and assisted by the United Nations and its system of organizations , with a view to creating among Governments , policy makers and the public a greater awareness of the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society .  
The Commission urged all members and associate members to take prompt action to establish national coordinating mechanisms for the Year , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Commission to undertake several specific measures , including the convening of a regional intergovernmental preparatory meeting and the initiation of a series of country studies on the role of the family in development .  
The meeting reviewed the global observances of the Year and their implications for national social policies in the process of sustainable development ; considered concepts and forms of international cooperation on family issues , with particular emphasis on assistance to developing countries ; and identified strategies and recommendations regarding national , regional and international follow-up to the Year .  
A wide array of activities was undertaken at the regional level , including four regional preparatory meetings , with the objective of supporting and supplementing national and local efforts .  
To that end , the Ministers emphasized the need for concerted action in the region against the spread of extremism , which exploited the noble and sacred values of their peoples , and against arms proliferation and drug trafficking , and for swift implementation of the measures to combat those problems adopted at the meeting on regional security held at Bamako on 22 and 23 August 1994 .  16 .  The Ministers noted with concern the difficult economic situation in their countries .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .

A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and , where agreed , to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement , logbook data on catch and effort , including data on fishing operations on the high seas , at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
The activities executed at the regional level by the UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific ( PROAP ) at Bangkok serve 40 member States . 4 / The national commissions of UNESCO in the member States themselves form a network of cooperation which is further supported by a number of networks of specialized educational institutions and several thousand key educators in Asia and the Pacific participating in South-South cooperation through a number of mechanisms .  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
Through its normative and field programmes at the global , regional , national and local levels in assessment and monitoring of land resources , policy and planning assistance , development and transfer of technologies , capacity building and demonstration in agriculture , livestock , forestry , fisheries and rural development .  FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
In a series of communications addressed , during 1993-1994 , to all States as well as to the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial institutions and the regional development banks , the Secretary-General requested them to provide him , on a regular basis , with information on action taken or contemplated by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States ( see A / 49 / 356 , para .  10 ) .  
Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
Establish , consistent with data protection legislation , databases on women and their qualification for use in appointing women to senior decision-making and advisory positions , for dissemination to Governments , regional and international organizations and private enterprise , political parties and other relevant bodies .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
Implementation is primarily the responsibility of Governments , but is also dependent on a wide range of institutions in the public , private and non-governmental sectors at the community , national , subregional / regional and international levels . specifically devoted to women 's advancement globally . 
Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
At the same time , operational activities are to be expanded significantly and a solid base for technical cooperation and assistance established , to strengthen the programme 's role as a service provider , as well as an honest broker in putting prospective donors and clients in touch , promoting international exchanges , coordinating regional and interregional action , etc .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
Within the framework of ECLAC / UNDP regional project RLA / 88 / 039 , entitled " Design of policies to strengthen the capacity for technological innovation and enhance international competitiveness in the Latin American entrepreneurial environment " , ECLAC and SELA officials held meetings to analyse the possibilities for cooperation in identifying and describing the current status of industrial policy in various countries in the region .  
Building upon earlier activities and based on qualitative and quantitative assessments of the coastal and marine pollution loads from land-based sources in the eastern African subregion , including the Comoros and Seychelles , the planned development of a regional overview and strategy will lead to the implementation of various additional activities , such as monitoring programmes .  
To disseminate and provide information to responsible United Nations and government bodies , as well as policy makers , official development assistance ( ODA ) - related donor and recipient Governments , corporations , and non-governmental organizations , for effective environmental management , risk management and government strategies for sustainable development at the global , regional and local levels ;  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
The Forum believed this statement sets out clear visionary but achievable goals , based on its members ' many shared interests and building on the Forum 's tradition of close regional consultation , which would significantly strengthen the region 's capacity to adapt to a rapidly changing international and regional environment .

ODA is one such international opportunity , and for many countries , it is a crucial one .  But with generally weakening oil prices and regional wars , the average saving rate of these countries fell from almost 65 per cent of GDP in the mid-1970s to less than 25 per cent by the late 1980s ( see United Nations , World Economic Survey , 1992 ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Department staff held meetings with the senior representatives of the League to discuss joint actions to organize a regional seminar on a new integrated approach for sustainable human development : spatial / sectoral development strategy for Arab countries .  
NULLWithin the framework of the ILO / ALO joint programme agreed upon at the beginning of 1994 , five Arab regional seminars / expert group meetings were organized on the following topics : employment and labour market policies ; small enterprises development ( for employers ' organizations ) ; employment and labour market programmes in the context of sustainable human development ; and Arab and international labour standards .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
In resolution 49 / 21 I , the General Assembly emphasized the necessity of designing a new programme for international cooperation with Central America , based on the principles established in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of CIREFCA , at a meeting held in Mexico City in June 1994 , and the regional strategy contained within the Alliance for Sustainable Development .  
NULLThe themes should be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue : to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
Technical institutions and other forms of professional interest groups have a valuable role to play , particularly at the regional level , in articulating commonly held concerns or requirements of countries that are exposed to similar types of hazards or share common geographical or cultural attributes .  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
The study will draw on a wide range of practices and experiences at all levels , which will be combined in a comprehensive appraisal of the needs of children , leading in turn to specific recommendations for action directed to the national , regional and international communities to enable them to respond more effectively to those needs .  
Starting as a small programme implemented jointly with UNEP to assist countries to implement the prior informed consent ( PIC ) procedure for chemicals in international trade , these programmes now increasingly address a wider spectrum of chemicals management topics , relevant to sound industrial development at both national and regional levels .  
Based on this research , a training programme has been developed to strengthen national and regional capacity for strategic development policy analysis , focusing on tools and techniques that incorporate the local cultural and social context for evaluating the socio-economic driving forces of structural change . 
A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and , where agreed , to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement , logbook data on catch and effort , including data on fishing operations on the high seas , at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations .  
The Programme of Action calls on Governments to increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially , inter alia , by formulating or strengthening , preferably by 1996 , and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels .

The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
The Charter of the United Nations devoted an entire chapter ( Chapter VIII ) to regional arrangements or agencies in which it set forth the basic principles governing their activities and established the legal framework for cooperation between regional agencies or arrangements and the United Nations in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Realizing the urgent need to resolve underlying conflicts , to diminish tensions and to accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control with a view to maintaining regional and international peace and security in a world free from the scourge of war and the burden of armaments ,  
His delegation was happy to note that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , having identified the weaknesses in the Global Programme of Action aimed at combating drugs , had , during 1995 , adopted resolutions intended to create a cohesive strategy in that domain , enhance regional and international cooperation , particularly between customs authorities , and prevent the diversion of psychotropic substances for illicit purposes .  
convinced that the appointment of a Director to head each of the three regional centres was essential to ensure the continued effective functioning of the centres , the General Assembly , in the same resolution , requested the Secretary-General to establish , as soon as practicable , the post of Director at each of the regional centres .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,

Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular , the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes with a time-frame for the period 1996-1997 ;  
also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially by , inter alia , formulating or strengthening and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , international , subregional , regional and international levels ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments , international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
MEKDAD ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had stated that all human rights were universal , interdependent and interconnected and that the international community should deal with human rights in a comprehensive , equitable and even-handed manner , while taking regional and cultural specificities into consideration .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
PHAM ( Viet Nam ) said that Viet Nam had not been immune to the overwhelming refugee crisis which had affected the entire world and had worsened in recent years as a result of poverty , regional or internal armed conflicts , political , economic and social crises , violence and intolerance .  
Supreme Council took note of the steps taken for the implementation of its decision at its fifteenth session concerning the development of economic cooperation within the framework of implementation of the Economic Agreement and approved the recommendations of the Committee on Financial and Economic Cooperation concerning the development of banking in Council States and increasing its competitivity at the regional and international levels , which would , in principle , permit national banks to open branches in Council States and effect a linkage between national automated banking networks in Council States . 
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and , in that regard , to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Robaina Gonz \ x { 5aee } ez ( Cuba ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Government of Cuba has requested the resumption of this session of the General Assembly in order to provide information regarding the events surrounding the repeated violation of our sovereignty by aircraft originating from United States territory , and also to give notice to the international community and to world public opinion that such violations are inadmissible and have dangerous implications for regional peace and security .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
Moreover , Greece has supported all international initiatives aimed at further promoting Balkan regional cooperation , such as the conference of ministers of southeastern Europe which convened this year in Sofia and which will meet again in Thessaloniki in June of next year the European Royaumont initiative and the United States southeast European cooperative initiative .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
The economic and social gap between the nations of the world is still wide in spite of positive political and economic developments on the regional and international scene , the creation of economic blocs , and free trade in the world .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
We therefore share the anguish of the international community for those countries where internal strife and regional conflict , and their attendant human suffering , continue to deny economic and social progress to millions of their people . 
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : At its fiftieth session the General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made by the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen and decided to give highest priority to the national , regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition , based on full participation by all .  
Intensified cooperation on their part with the United Nations system at the global , regional and national levels in the area of economic and social development would be most desirable to ensure coherent development efforts to produce fruitful results .  
Moreover , it is precisely in situations requiring difficult choices that the objectives , commitments and Programme of Action adopted in Copenhagen can be given specific meaning , despite various obstacles which limit the leeway of decision makers .  The objectives and commitments of the world social Summit can be inconvenient in practice , or can conflict with other priorities at the local , regional and international levels .  
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
The convening of many international conferences in the past decade to articulate and codify further norms of behaviour for an orderly new system , the relative success of the United Nations machinery in preventing and de-escalating many international and regional conflicts , and the constructive debate on reinvigorating the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council are positive examples providing hopeful signals in that direction .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The review recognized that , while some encouraging progress has been made in social and economic development , in increasing democratization , in regional integration and in conflict prevention , management and resolution at the regional level , this progress has been uneven , and much remains to be done , as has been outlined , inter alia , in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit ( A / 50 / 885 ) .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
Also at the fourth ministerial meeting , South Africa and the member States emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation among member States of the zone , in law enforcement agencies and within the international and regional organizations in the fight against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Despite the importance of bilateral relations and successful regional organizations , the United Nations remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a multipolar and democratic one . 
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
The successful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations based on internationally accepted principles can not be replaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious regional associations .  
Due to our own painful past experiences , my delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Department of Public Information in encouraging the development of a free and responsible press as an essential element for effective democratization through its series of regional seminars , organized in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and supported by UNDP , on promoting pluralistic and independent media .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
Peace in the Middle East will not be comprehensive or lasting until a strict regime for regional security is established , based on arrangements that provide equal security for all parties with minimum levels of armament .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Bangladesh welcomed the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action , which embodied practical commitments and priorities for action at the national , regional and international levels for preventing the commercial sexual exploitation of children , and for protecting and reintegrating the children who were its victims . 
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
The UNEP contribution will also include , depending on the availability of funds , establishment of regional expert panels to develop suitable classification systems and to evaluate the accuracy and utility of national , continental and global data sets being developed under land-cover characterization studies .  
Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication , local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed , and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence .  
The Republic of Croatia , being cognizant that the overall peace process in the former Yugoslavia is at a delicate stage and being fully determined to contribute to peace and stability in the region , would support a continued deployment of United Nations military observers in the area of the Prevlaka peninsula in Croatia , with an understanding that such deployment shall be a short-term interim arrangement , until , as proposed by my Government , the United Nations arrangement is replaced by a regional arrangement .  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
Realizing the urgent need to resolve underlying conflicts , to diminish tensions and to accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control with a view to maintaining regional and international peace and security in a world free from the scourge of war and the burden of armaments ,  
It has also proposed a joint mission of high-level representatives of international and regional organizations to visit Somalia and to meet with all relevant personalities and factions to convey the resolve of the international organizations to assist the Somali people and to express the hope that a conference on national reconciliation may be convened at any venue of their choice .  
Thirdly and finally , the international community , through UNOMIL , humanitarian cooperation , support for the needs of economic and social development and the monitoring of human rights and the electoral process , inter alia , is strengthening national and regional efforts .  
Convinced that democracy was a prerequisite for respect for human dignity and socio-economic development , the Sudan had held popular congresses at the national , regional , provincial and local levels .  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially by , inter alia , formulating or strengthening and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter and its annex to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under the agenda items entitled " General and complete disarmament : regional disarmament " , " Review and implementation of the concluding document of the twelfth special session of the General Assembly : regional confidence-building measures " and " Maintenance of international security " , and of the Security Council .

Supports the concern of the Central American countries to create a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces and the pre-eminence of civil authority , urges the Central American Security Commission to pursue negotiations for the preparation of the treaty on democratic security in Central America , which constitutes one of the basic aims of the Central American Integration System , and requests the Secretary-General to provide it with the requisite support in a timely manner ;  
Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .

Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
Undertaking the valuation of the goods and services of a forest at local , national , regional and global levels is a complex and costly exercise that must be carried out in response to specific demands and guided by the type of decisions for which the results are to be used .  
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .

Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
Assessments of the potential impact of variability and change of climate and the atmospheric environment were conducted by some countries through bilateral and multilateral support and as part of the UNEP-implemented World Climate Impact and Response Strategies Programme concerning areas both within and outside their national jurisdiction , including studies of vulnerability to sealevel rise , effects on agriculture , forests and other sensitive and important sectors , either as single or regional group efforts .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
The Executive Director of UNDCP has encouraged resident coordinators and resident representatives , as well as the directors of UNDCP regional and country offices , to pursue closely all channels to enhance an integrated approach to problems touching on the mandates of several agencies , thus consolidating scarce resources in an effective manner by eliminating overlap and proliferation of parallel interventions .

Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Also reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments and international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;

Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Each conference made major recommendations , which will have an impact on the ways in which national Governments will function , and point to the need for an effective and efficient public administration system in planning and implementing those recommendations and for the support and cooperation of relevant United Nations and other international and regional institutions in assisting Governments to improve their public administration systems .  
To strengthen effective collaboration and coordination among various programmes in governance and public management currently carried out by various United Nations agencies , including Bretton-Woods institutions such as the World Bank and IMF , it is recommended that the consultative group include representation from all relevant United Nations agencies , regional commissions and the World Bank . The group will also be open to other interregional and regional governmental organizations and appropriate international or regional professional and research institutions .  
While the main efforts for administrative improvement must be initiated and sustained at the national level , it needs to be recognized that technical cooperation with international and regional institutions , including regional United Nations agencies , will be vital in assisting and supporting the process of improvement .  
UNDCP will seek to be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors , international financial institutions , agencies and programmes within the United Nations system and regional organizations involved in development work .

Important objectives for further development of global and regional legal regimes and management policies would be the re-establishment of a balance between fishing efforts and fishing yields , proper enforcement of agreed conservation measures , the regulation and control of all catches ( including those from the high seas ) and the offsetting of all catches ( including discards ) against the determined quotas for each stock .  
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .

Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements worldwide , 2 .  Endorses the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements [ 3 ] / and the Habitat Agenda [ 4 ] / adopted by the Conference on 14 June 1996 ;  
A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
All norms and principles of human rights enshrined in regional and international human rights instruments and covenants shall be an integral part of the constitution of the Sudan and any law , decree , executive order or policy measure contrary thereto shall be considered null and void and unconstitutional ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Engage in systematic exchange of information and consider effective implementation of relevant international conventions , including the harmonization of their domestic legislation with those conventions , and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral or regional basis and other measures for the purpose of combating offences referred to in article 2 of this Convention ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
More attention should also be paid to the activities of non-governmental scholarly bodies , such as the International Law Association , and the regional consultative committees , as well as to the valuable activity of bodies connected with the Council of Europe which were active in promoting the application of international law .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
While the international community was giving considerable attention to the promotion and protection of human rights , and while the international and regional human rights mechanisms had therefore gained in effectiveness , it nevertheless had to be recognized that much more needed to be done to check the wave of reported and noted violations , especially in view of the geopolitical instability , regional and ethnic conflicts and recent social turmoil .  
Although the focus of the proposed programme on the three major themes of regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , and poverty alleviation , is welcomed , there may be a need to sharpen the subprogramme elements further to better reflect desired activities in conformity with relevant legislative mandates , including the recently held United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) .  
Several options may be considered , such as : ( a ) encouraging governments to provide greater support to national , regional and international institutions ; ( b ) requesting the governing bodies of international organizations to give a high priority to work in support of the UNFCCC process ; ( c ) revising the guidance to the GEF so as to encourage support for specific methodological issues ; and ( d ) providing for additions to the secretariat budget and / or contributions to the supplementary fund for the period 1998-1999 .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Despite the existence of hundreds of bilateral or regional agreements regulating the use of international watercourses , it had been felt that those rules and prevailing customary international law were still vague and did not cover all the practical problems which might arise between riparian States , especially the problem of water pollution .  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
To criminalize in an effective manner acts of bribery in international commercial transactions of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate in a coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Attempts to separate international and regional systems for protecting human rights were artificial ; both systems should be complementary and mutually supportive .  
The main conclusions and recommendations in that regard were : to prepare and submit to the General Assembly for consideration a comprehensive strategic programme of cooperation with regional organizations in peacekeeping and other peace-related activities , for the development of which it was necessary to establish a project team composed of representatives of all departments concerned ; to conclude bilateral framework agreements between United Nations and regional organizations concerning practical aspects of peacekeeping and other peace-related activities ; and to create a mechanism for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
REZVANI ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) said that regional institutions and instruments played a key role in the promotion and protection of human rights , and were capable of reflecting regional political , social , cultural and economic factors .  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .

All available tools - trade , investment and structural adjustment - must be brought to bear on the problem of the marginalization of least developed countries , and there must be close cooperation between WTO , various organs of the United Nations system , the Bretton Woods organizations , and the various regional bodies to ensure that the resources and expertise of the international community remained focused , coordinated and relevant to the most pressing global needs . 
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .

Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;

Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .

Nonetheless , the ] [ The Panel was convinced of the necessity of having a set of criteria and indicators wide enough to be used at the global level , rather than a reduced core set that might prevent the mutual recognition of regional and national initiatives , the exchange of information and the further elaboration of the issues of best forest practices and voluntary codes .  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
The Panel underscored the need for international institutions to support national , [ subregional ] [ subnational ] , regional and international action towards sustainable forest management , [ building a consensus on approaches [ and standards ] worldwide and improving the conditions for adequate capacity-building and financing ] [ to build consensus on approaches and better coordinate their international cooperation efforts ] for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] .  
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights both called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in carrying out the activities of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education .

On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , in 1998 , major celebratory events will be organized at the international , regional and national levels , during which the importance of universal knowledge and understanding of the provisions of the Universal Declaration will be emphasized .  
All regional organizations , national focal points and other interested partners in the Decade will be requested to report to the High Commissioner for purposes of his mid-term evaluation in the year 2000 , and again for his final report in 2004 , on progress made since the completion of the survey , including celebratory events held and versions of the Universal Declaration available , and on continuing needs and challenges in the achievement of the objectives of these programme elements .  
For purposes of the High Commissioner 's report , all participating national focal points , international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , specialized agencies and programmes , and interested others , shall be requested to provide relevant information to the High Commissioner , based upon their own independent assessments and activities .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs , including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence .  
His delegation was also encouraged by regional activities designed to implement Agenda 21 and by the fact that , at the national level , approximately 100 countries had reformed their institutional structures with a view to achieving sustainable development .  
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .  
Illicit drugs were not a great social problem in his country , but it recognized their evil effects , and had therefore taken part in relevant international and regional conferences , and had signed bilateral agreements and international conventions .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
The pivotal role of regional organizations in democratizing development should be enhanced by opening channels to the regional level for the views of those at the local level , and by reducing bureaucratic obstacles to the flow or volume of assistance ; the United Nations regional economic and social commissions are well placed to contribute to such an effort .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
The Cape Town Workshop encourages governments , international and regional organizations as well as non _ governmental organizations and civil society to promote a debate on the need for and use of minimum humanitarian standards or standards of humanity applicable in all circumstances as well as on practical measures aimed at the improvement of the situation of those affected .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
After having considered the note , the Executive Committee , at its forty-seventh session , adopted a conclusion on comprehensive and regional approaches within a protection framework , 4 which identified certain principal elements of protection-based comprehensive approaches and encouraged States , in coordination and cooperation with each other , and with international organizations , if applicable , to consider the adoption of such approaches . 
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
Notes with appreciation the timely production of the new , comprehensive report on the state of the world environment , Global Environment Outlook-1,4 as requested by the Council in its decision 18 / 27 C of 26 May 1995 , as well as the participatory assessment process ( known as the Global Environment Outlook process ) which has been established to support United Nations Environment Programme assessment activities , and its components ( scientific working groups , network of collaborating centres , regional and United Nations-wide consultative mechanisms ) ;  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
The technical cooperation programme has focused on incorporating international human rights standards in national legal systems , developing policies and practices and building national capacities and regional structures for the promotion and protection of all human rights , democracy and the rule of law .  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
In its foreign relations , Viet Nam will constantly pursue an open foreign policy of independence , diversification and the promotion of multilateral relations along the line of gradual regional and international integration , thus making worthy contributions to the cause of peace , national independence , democracy and social progress .  
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
From 1995 to the present SELA has accomplished a fundamental reorientation and adaptation in order to achieve two main objectives : first , to help the 27 members become integrated into the current international environment and , secondly , to coordinate their agendas for regional , hemispheric and international actions .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
Furthermore , the need calls for strengthening coordination between the aforementioned and other regional and international development programmes , and first and foremost the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , in order to mobilize economic resources and their generous influx of contributions required for a speedy response to the needs of affected and vulnerable peoples .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
Escaping this state of mind and building a new world based on cooperation and the rule of law requires not only political will , but careful planning in order to foster confidence and to mitigate economic , security and social concerns at national and regional levels .  
Terrorism is the wicked result of widespread lawlessness and the violent obstruction of public participation , which in its various forms and manifestations threatens human societies at the national , regional and international levels . 
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
The conditions that prevailed prior to the establishment of the zones included , inter alia , peaceful relations and mutual confidence , economic cooperation and a general belief in the enhancement of common interests through institutional regional frameworks .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Inspired by the purposes and principles of the Damascus Declaration , and on the basis of the role played by member States in promoting Arab solidarity , advancing the interests of the Arab nation and safeguarding joint national security ; in response to current requirements , and in the light of international and regional developments , particularly with regard to the peace process , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs affirmed their absolute commitment to work in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Arab Summit Conference held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June 1996 .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
The revitalized regional integration initiative of Kenya , the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda , now called the East African Cooperation , provided expanded markets for local manufacturing output among member countries .  Also , the signing of a new trade protocol among the member countries of the Southern African Development Community has paved the way for expanded markets and increased trade among the Community 's member States , although regional manufacturing is increasingly dominated by South Africa .  
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
In addition to its influence on the regular programme of work of the Conference , the increase in the number of ECE member countries , which has greatly extended the number of countries in the region in need of technical assistance , has obliged ECE to appoint regional advisers , including on economic statistics , and to seek to provide other forms of technical assistance , such as through a UNDP-funded project in social and demographic statistics .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
In spite of their transitory nature , those fluctuations may , owing to their echo-effect , cause significant longer-term changes in the age structure of populations at the local , national or even regional levels , such as an unusual increase or decrease in the number of older persons ( for instance , due to surges of refugees in sub-Saharan Africa ) , or an increase in the numbers of older widows ( due to increased male mortality among the older working-age groups in several European countries in transition from centrally planned economies ) .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
What is remarkable is that although Zaire is losing on the battlefield , the head of State has emerged stronger : stronger with the armed forces , which call for his leadership ; stronger in international affairs , since he is seen as the only person capable of resolving a regional crisis ; and stronger in politics , since even his most critical opponents have joined him in the effort of national reconciliation .  
The Begeer report assumed that the existing international statistical system , which is decentralized in both the subject and regional dimensions , would continue unchanged , an assumption that is critical to its recommendations .  
Reporting to the Senior Demobilization Officer the incumbent would ( a ) coordinate field operations , including direction of their day-to-day operations ; ( b ) supervise regional demobilization officers and health and child soldier coordinators ; ( c ) manage and ensure timely availability and delivery of resources to demobilization sites ; ( d ) ensure that demobilization centres operate according to standard operational procedures ; and ( e ) participate in planning and policy development and catalyse efficient use of resources in the field . a Contribution for humanitarian assistance only .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements ,  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
For retransmission of major national and international events and to meet a variety of needs , the ONPT also has an Earth mobile station which is used for occasional remote sensing and telephony , and which can operate with international and regional satellites .  
In its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission again requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the cooperation with UNDCP , including the undertaking of joint initiatives , and called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services and the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , UNDP , the World Bank and international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , utilizing the expertise of the Programme .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
Following the precedent of the seventeenth special session , the preparatory body may wish to recommend that the vice-presidents of the upcoming special session should be the same as those of the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly , on the understanding that the regional groups may make substitutions of the vice-presidents allocated to each group .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Such efforts should be pursued in close cooperation with community and religious leaders and non-governmental organizations , at all levels of the State , i.e . national , regional , zonal and woreda levels , and special emphasis should be placed on the need to coordinate the policies designed to implement the Convention between central and local authorities .  
To this end , the resident representatives worked in partnership throughout 1996 with all relevant headquarters units , particularly with ( a ) the regional bureaux , which provided the supporting management framework , advice , training and , together with the Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) , assistance in matching core competencies with country office needs and ( b ) the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support ( BPPS ) , which supplied analytical tools , developed in consultation with country offices , global studies and methodological guidance .  
Among the key recommendations incorporated as a result of the evaluation were : networking among existing regional institutions rather than building new ones ; forming steering committees comprising focal points to manage projects ; and revitalizing the use of intergovernmental meetings as the best mechanism for approving important regional initiatives .  50 .  Another important initiative was the RBAS Quarterly Brief .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
At its 2nd plenary meeting , on 7 February 1997 , the Economic and Social Council decided to consider at its substantive session of 1997 , under the item entitled " Regional cooperation " , in pursuance of Council resolution 1982 / 50 of 28 July 1982 and taking into account the joint recommendations made by the executive secretaries of the regional commissions pursuant to Council decision 1982 / 174 of 30 July 1982 , the question of review and reform of the regional commissions .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
Instead of this differentiation , advocacy work will be treated as an essential component of all of the organization 's work , since it is a critical element in enabling UNIFEM to influence policy changes and legal reforms at a systemic level , both within the United Nations system and at regional and country levels .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
The Panel also emphasized the need for efforts to enhance comparability and compatibility between various international and regional processes on the development and implementation of criteria and indicators , and stressed the importance of mutual recognition among sets of criteria and indicators as tools for assessing trends in forest management and conditions at the national level ; and on transparent methods for the measurement of indicators and for the collection , assembly , storage and dissemination of data .  
The Panel agreed that forest-related international , regional and bilateral agencies and organizations , existing legal instruments , financial and trade institutions and treaty bodies should mobilize their respective strengths and capacities in implementing the proposals for action in the Panel 's report , and should further promote policy dialogue , consensus-building and international cooperation , recalling Agenda 21 and paragraph 10 of the Forest Principles .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
The Division concluded that in future it would ( a ) only undertake projects in areas where the need for the analytical and technical capacity of the Division was apparent ; ( b ) support and encourage greater involvement of the regional commissions ; ( c ) assign higher priority to projects that emphasized training and short-term technical assistance ; and ( d ) participate in implementing statistical projects only when projects were of significant international or methodological interest or where staff exposure through participation in project activities was seen as a learning opportunity .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Intergovernmental dialogue on sustainable development could usefully be reorganized to consider a limited number of strategic priority issues , so as to develop a more focused approach to relevant activities in the United Nations system both at the international and at the regional and country levels .  
Task managers should be encouraged to promote joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , and to foster a more integrated approach which incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development .  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Regretting the failure of the three Western countries to respond positively to international and regional endeavours and to the efforts made to devise a settlement based on the principles of international law , in a context of mutual understanding and constructive dialogue , with the result that the Security Council , following its consultations of 14 March 1997 , extended the embargo measures imposed on the Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
Although the regional and subregional presence of the United Nations system is increasing , there is no apparent overarching framework to guide that process , and each organization is pursuing its distinctive approach , which may have practical value , but the overall value and impact of the United Nations system could be enhanced through a more coordinated approach .  
An important dimension implicit in regional and subregional operational activities , that of the practice and potential for technical cooperation among developing countries , needs to be made more explicit so that more opportunities for such cooperation can be exploited .  
Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Review the salient issues in the regional strategies and action programmes emerging from recent global conferences , international conventions and agreements ; monitor the implementation of Agenda 21 at the regional level ; and articulate the region 's response to relevant global initiatives , ensuring that such initiatives support the development of the region .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
Convinced that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic , social and related fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of its subsidiary bodies located in the developing regions ,  
In addition , the Committee will promote the implementation of measures designed to strengthen economic cooperation and integration among African countries ; assist African countries and their intergovernmental organizations in making the policy instruments for economic cooperation and integration of the African region more effective ; and identify measures to coordinate and harmonize micro - and macroeconomic policies among African countries as a prerequisite for accelerating regional economic integration . 
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
[ 43 ] / The main conclusion reached in this study on income distribution at the international level is to signal the need to include cooperation agreements tied to commercial agreements on free trade and economic and commercial cooperation , whether at the international , regional or bilateral level . 
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .  
Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
The DCRK is a unified State of a confederal form in which a unified national Government is established on condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other 's ideas and systems , a Government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy respectively with equal power of authority and duties . 
Data from these surveys will serve a new major initiative , namely to establish a national strategy for increasing social productivity and reducing regional disparities ; this work supported by UNDP will be based on defining and mapping poverty , and on establishing a national poverty line or band . 
When ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to the present Convention , or at any time thereafter , a Party which is not a regional economic integration organization may declare in a written instrument submitted to the Depositary that , in respect of any dispute not resolved in accordance with paragraph 2 , it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any Party accepting the same obligation :  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The expected outcome of the Conference is a Lisbon Declaration on Youth Policies and Programmes by ministers responsible for youth to further promote the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond through more focused and specific intersectoral measures at the regional , national and local / municipal levels .  
Confirming that at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , the international community recognized that there was a lack of knowledge about mountain ecosystems and called for renewed international and regional cooperation to develop an integrated approach for conserving , upgrading and using the land , water , plant , animal and human resources and promoting alternative livelihood opportunities for mountain inhabitants with a view to improving their living standards ,  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
In November 1996 , in the context of promoting bilateral and regional cooperation , the prime ministers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania signed at Riga a declaration on the fight against money-laundering , drawn up in cooperation with UNDCP , the European Commission and the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Operating through a regional unit , which was in contact with the national technical units , the project assisted countries in the formulation of policies and programmes in the social sector and sought to strengthen national management capabilities in the social sectors of the countries concerned with special emphasis on the sectors of basic education , health , nutrition and the strengthening of social investment funds .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
With reference to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , the countries of the Pacific region had expressed growing concern over the increased intensity and frequency of storms and typhoons in the region , with an impact that would continue to stretch their limited resources .  International assistance was required to make regional activities more efficient .  
In the coming months , Canada would continue to promote action in favour of sustainable development at various important regional and global meetings , and it was committed to cooperating for the achievement of satisfactory results at the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
The Government of Germany has already expressed its intention to support the programme in addition to its extensive national effort , including setting up a commission , advisory group and focal point , preparing a postage stamp series , making recommendations on a society for all ages , holding a national parliamentary assembly of older persons in the German Bundestag and many other regional , local and communal events .  
It could be argued that a staged approach for the penetration of foreign markets , starting from domestic markets and moving to regional ones which displayed similar sociocultural characteristics , could be a viable option .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
With regard to the efforts to restructure UNHCR , his delegation supported the measures to increase its efficiency , while stressing that any lasting solution would have to be based on national , regional and international solidarity , which entailed the mobilization of considerable financial and human resources .  
In that connection , he cited the numerous initiatives that had been undertaken by the President of Tunisia , Mr . Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and his continuing efforts to promote peace in Africa . Tunisia called upon the parties concerned to halt the fighting and re-establish peace , and invited international and regional organizations to provide assistance to the victims in order to avert a tragedy that would affect the entire African continent . 
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
The granting of preferential access to external markets , through bilateral , regional and international agreements , would greatly enhance the investment promotion efforts of developing countries , particularly smaller economies , as a minimum market size is an important prerequisite for many investors .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
We undertake to continue to coordinate our positions on these issues in regional and international forums and to contribute to the work of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the goal of intensifying the analysis of the question of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national laws , strengthening multilateralism through the application of the international agreements signed by States and guiding the external conduct of our countries on the basis of international law .  
The Committee notes that the Governing Council of UNEP , in its decision 19 / 31 of 7 February 1997 , requested the Executive Director to strengthen the regional offices of UNEP by providing them with appropriate functional and administrative capabilities to enable decentralized implementation of regional environmental programmes and priorities , as developed by regional and subregional ministerial meetings .  
On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .  The Chinese Government adheres to Mr . Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on diplomatic endeavours and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace .  
With the advent of the twenty-first century , we now face an historic choice as to what kind of a world we should bring to the new century .  The Chinese delegation holds that the international community should work to establish a just and rational new international political and economic order to ensure global and regional security .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Closely related to the follow-up to and implementation of the Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation of and follow up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels to the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
To reinforce understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided on a regional basis into groups , each of which studied a case history where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
It was the only State excluded from all the regional groups ; it was barred from the Economic and Social Council , whose work affected the lives of everyone in the world ; it was barred from contributing to the professional forums created by the United Nations ; and Israelis could be elected to United Nations bodies only in rare , ad personam elections not dependent on the regional group system , although even then , even world-renowned Israelis had a negligible chance of obtaining the necessary votes .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training , in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse , which should include raising public awareness on the detrimental effects of drug abuse ;  
However , it is our opinion that in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain specific principles , namely , it must be balanced , comprehensive , non-discriminatory , and fully enhance the national , regional and international security of all States according to the rules of international law .  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Requests all concerned organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the regional commissions and other relevant international and multilateral institutions , to make , within their respective fields of competence , substantive contributions and proposals for further action as submissions to the preparatory process of the Conference ;  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
Expected results and successful criteria include : ( a ) functional gender-development units will have been established in each of the 27 countries participating in the regional programme ; ( b ) databases on national and regional gender-in-development activities will have been set up ; ( c ) networks will have been established between non-governmental organizations and gender-in-development units ; and ( d ) institutions involved in gender-related research and training will have been provided with results that may have an impact on national gender-related issues .  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
As outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report of the Secretary-General , adjustments would need to be made to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment during the biennium 1998-1999 in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country and address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to provide adequate security for all special rapporteurs , and to live up to its pledge to provide logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery ;  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .  
The Security Council welcomes the outcome of meetings between the Somali leaders held in Cairo concluded on 22 December 1997 , in particular their decision to adopt a federal system with regional autonomy and their agreement to form a transitional government of national unity and to hold an inclusive conference of national reconciliation in Baidoa through which a presidential council and a Prime Minister will be elected .  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country , a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated , and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
In order to lay the foundations of this program and set it in motion , we should consider holding an international meeting with the participation of the relevant agencies of the system , regional organs and the respective national programmes of the countries concerned .  
Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of members of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past few years to contain the devastating effects of the conflicts in the Arab Gulf region , which has great importance to regional and international strategies , and their continuing endeavour to support progress towards joint reconstruction and cooperation , the unstable political and security conditions in the region remain a source of concern for us .  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
In seeking to enhance its participation in such regional and international institutions , the United Arab Emirates , thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State , His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan , has achieved a qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental , economic , social , environmental and human fields in the past two decades .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
He also affirmed that Iraq would reciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by taking two balanced steps : one corresponding to the Iranian step and another in line with our deep sense of humanitarian , regional and international responsibility to encourage the taking of successive , continual steps to ensure that regional security , mutual respect and balanced interests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a way that benefits the peoples of the region .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
The Sao Paulo Consensus adopted by the Conference renews the region \ x { e5b8 } commitment to give priority to the issues on the social agenda , to incorporate social equity into economic growth , to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to projects with a social impact , to strengthen cooperation with all sectors of civil society , to ensure an integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental dimensions of development and to establish a regional database of successful social projects , among other goals .  
Within this overall conceptual construct , the Summit resolved to create a framework for policy and action at the national , regional and international levels geared to the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
The Nicaragua Declaration , signed one and a half months ago , strengthened the process of regional integration and laid the foundation for a possible political unification of the Central American countries , and it further enhanced Central American social , economic and trade policy .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
Lessons learned from Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina prove that the existing international and regional organizations possess tools that are efficient for preventive and post-conflict engagement , on the condition that they are applied in a concerted , timely and proper manner .  
In that statement baseless and unsubstantiated allegations were made against some regional States , including my country , to divert the attention of the international community from the illegal policies and inhuman actions of Israel , such as the continued occupation of the territories of others , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
In the international economic sphere , for example , regional integration needs to be built upon the spirit of mutual interdependence and transparency to prevent any attempt at establishing inward-looking arrangements , leading to closed trading blocs that could be misused as tools for protectionism .  
During the past three years we have made extraordinary progress in our integration efforts , which extend from a new conceptual horizon , one that has become better balanced and more inclusive with the creation of the Alliance for Sustainable Development and the establishment of innovative regional projects to increase regional competitiveness by means of joint efforts on the part of Governments , academic centres and sectors of production . 
We agreed on the broadest possible review and modernization of our regional institutional framework , as we were convinced that the benefits of development to which our people are entitled can not be tapped by each country separately they are attainable only to a regional community , because of the dynamics of today 's increasingly interdependent environment .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
This multifaceted process of sustainable development necessitates constant and close multilateral cooperation as well as concerted efforts on a regional and national basis .  
There has been a rapid expansion in both formal and informal regional arrangements , driven in part by concerns over the potential negative impacts of globalization on national economies and by the positive prospects of regionalization .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
They should have institutional arrangements that are flexible , democratic , transparent and responsive to changing global and regional conditions .  
Convinced further that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic and social fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of Headquarters and the subsidiary organs located in the developing regions ,  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;  
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject related to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation .  
With the appointment of regional alternative development advisers posted in south and south-east Asia and Latin America and strengthened expertise in alternative development at headquarters , UNDCP has underlined its commitment to supporting alternative development as a viable tool for reducing illicit crop cultivation .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
In its continuing effort to promote and develop policies and programmes for older persons , the ESCAP secretariat is preparing a directory of national focal points on ageing in Asia and the Pacific ; a directory of non-governmental organizations active in dealing with older persons in the region ; and a bibliography of international and regional mandates and relevant documents concerning ageing and older persons .  
The aims and objectives of the national youth policy of Indonesia are : ( a ) to help foster Indonesia awareness , identity , solidarity and prosperity among youth ; ( b ) to promote policies and programmes relating to youth as an integral part of social and cultural values among the Asian and Pacific nations ; and ( c ) to realize the potential of youth as human resources in regional development .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels . 
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
In its resolution 1996 / 64 of 23 April 1996 entitled " Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Asian and Pacific region " , the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that regional arrangements played a fundamental role in promoting and protecting human rights and that they should reinforce universal human rights standards , as contained in international human rights instruments .  
The Kathmandu workshop proved to be a crucial turning point when , for the first time in the series of meetings , it focused on regional arrangements , explored available options , identified specific steps as building-blocks , and concluded with a clear consensus in the form of agreed workshop conclusions .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
On balance the amount of progress achieved is discouraging : the interminable debates that take place in Parliament are repeated in CNE , as demonstrated by the two months required to elect its bureau and the failure to establish regional commissions ( that of Kinshasa was set up in August ) .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
The Sub-Commission considered that it would be useful for the Commission to establish , for a three _ year period , a Working Group composed of five experts nominated by Governments , to be appointed by the Chairman of the Commission at its fifty _ third session on the basis of equitable geographical representation and in consultation with the regional groups in the Commission , with the following mandate :  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .

The creation of wider markets through regional and subregional economic integration remains a fundamental prerequisite for a viable economic diversification strategy in Africa , if only to make up for the small size of domestic markets and to encourage the restructuring of national production systems to take advantage of complementarities in resource endowments and economies of scale .  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,

Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
There are , however , signs that the successful implementation of this operation is threatened , primarily because the separatist leadership opposes their return , as is the phased restoration of the natural regional demographics which would be an inevitable consequence of an expanded peacekeeping mandate .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .

The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
The promotion of joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , leading to a more integrated approach that incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development , also needs to be encouraged .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .

Shall we simply say that we engaged in endless debate , encompassing plenary meetings , informal plenary meetings , open _ ended consultations , and meetings of regional and political groups and other impromptu gatherings too numerous to mention ? 
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
The SRCF will be used for : ( i ) financing assistance to governments and regional / subregional bodies in the national , subregional and regional action programming ; ( ii ) financing assistance for the preparation of local area development programmes ( LADPs ) that respond to National Action Programmes , bearing in mind also the dual track approach for LADPs and NAPs that some countries might envisage ; and ( iii ) catalytic financing for National Desertification Funds , designed within the context of National Action Programmes . 22 .  Finance for civil society .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) ;  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
Aware and convinced that the survival of humanity is a collective responsibility , we decided in Rio to establish a new kind of partnership built of common yet differentiated responsibility in order to promote national , regional and world cooperation for development that we wished to be sustainable .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
As the illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are serious and growing concerns in the region , the development of an accurate annual estimate of the situation and trends is essential to the successful development and implementation of regional strategies and subregional programmes .  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
Observers presented examples of cases where , in their opinion , persons belonging to minorities were unable to participate effectively in cultural , religious , social , economic and public life and where their participation in decision _ making at the national and regional levels was limited .  
Ms . Estebanez said that the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe had established undertakings on the part of States aimed at the protection of the languages of historical or regional minorities in Europe , through comprehensive treatment of linguistic minority issues in the areas of : education ; the use of minority languages in dealings with the administrative authorities and public services and in administrative proceedings ; cultural activities ; economic and social life ; and trans-border contacts .

In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,

One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
We call upon donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank , the African Development Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to give favourable consideration to project proposals on strengthening our national or regional capacities and creating the expertise required for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime and corruption , elaborated by the Division and submitted to them .

Recalling the importance of regional stability and the need to consolidate the progress achieved so far , and in particular to assist the people of the Central African Republic to consolidate the process of national reconciliation taking into account the need to maintain a secure and stable environment conducive to the economic recovery and to the holding of free and fair presidential elections , 
Provision of technical advisory services to Member States , as well as international and regional governmental and non-governmental organizations on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science , satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in these fields , upon request ( 8 to 10 per year ) .  
The activities undertaken to mark the anniversary by Governments , international and regional organizations and , most notably , by civil society at all levels - local , national , regional and international _ have also provided clear evidence of a reinvigorated commitment to human rights as the common principles which should unite the international community as a new century begins . 
The purpose of the OHCHR technical cooperation programme is to assist countries - including Governments and civil society - in promoting and protecting all human rights at the national and regional levels , through the incorporation of international human rights standards in national laws , policies and practices , and building a sustainable national capacity to implement these standards and ensure respect for human rights .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
His Government , which had also received assistance from the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) and the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , considered that regional and subregional organizations minimized the escalation of conflicts and strengthened the rapid deployment mechanism of the United Nations ; for that reason , it strongly supported the initiative to strengthen cooperation with those organizations .  
At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Solving that global problem , which affected adoptive parents abroad as well as the institutions and legal systems of the babies countries of origin , required adopting the Special Rapporteurs recommendation that international and regional registers of adopted children should be established worldwide .  
Reaffirm that the central decision _ making role in determining the content of the regional technical cooperation programme , evaluating the progress achieved and determining actions to be taken under the programme in the future will continue to be played by the annual intergovernmental workshop with the assistance of the open-ended team in Geneva comprising Geneva _ based representatives of the Governments of the Asian-Pacific region ;  
It would require the support of the international community in order , inter alia to promote full employment as a basic priority of economic and social policies and to encourage the formulation of policies and strategies , at the national and regional level , that would meet the basic needs of the people , strengthen their productive capacities and empower them to participate in decision-making .  
The international community be encouraged to cooperate fully in the various efforts , at the national , regional and global levels , for the prevention of the spread of harmful aquatic organisms through ships ballast water ;  
The Commission could urge relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
Some delegations expressed continued support for improving the operation of GESAMP , while noting at the same time that regional approaches were most practical for improving access to sound scientific understanding .  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Mr . Erds ( Hungary ) said that Hungary firmly believed that , for the scourge of terrorism to be successfully suppressed , there must be no safe havens for terrorists , and that objective could only be achieved through the establishment of a global system based on a unified international approach and effective regional cooperation .  
Her delegation strongly condemned all acts , methods and practice of terrorism regardless of who committed them and for what purpose , because they targeted the lives and property of innocent people , violated basic human rights and posed a serious threat to regional and international peace and security .  
UNESCO welcomed the ongoing discussions on the feasibility of establishing a United Nations radio network and it looked forward to being able to participate in programming and to working with Member States to promote cultural diversity , including linguistic diversity , through communication through the development of endogenous media capacities , particularly radio broadcasting at the community , national and regional levels .

In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
The Sub-Committee , while respecting the principles set out in article 3 , is encouraged to cooperate for the prevention of torture in general with the relevant United Nations organs and mechanisms as well as international , regional and national institutions or organizations working towards strengthening the protection of persons from torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
More recently , MERCOSUR has adopted a protocol on competition policy proscribing individual conduct or concerted agreements impeding , restricting or distorting competition or free access to markets or abusing a dominant position in a relevant regional market within MERCOSUR and affecting trade between its member States .  
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .

During the biennium 20002001 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
However , with growth of output in Africa projected to slow to about 2 per cent in 1999 below the level of population growth this modest recovery is already being threatened by international financial crises , declining commodity prices and regional conflicts .  
Taking into account the growing spread of poverty and its highly negative social and political dimensions , the special session may wish to consider what kind of national , regional and international measures can be recommended in order to reverse the negative trends .  
Non-recurrent publications on : studies on transport efficiency ( 2 ) ; global framework for electronic commerce and development ; legal guidelines on electronic commerce for trade points ( 2 ) ; regional and international institutional framework for trade points ; major developments in international trade law ; studies on human resources development issues in trade-supporting services ( 2 ) ; trade facilitation handbook ;  
National and bilateral TCDC activities during the reporting period clearly indicate that an increasing number of developing countries are emerging as key proponents of the TCDC process , assuming leadership roles in promoting , organizing and funding bilateral and regional TCDC-related projects as part of their annual commitment to trade , investment and international cooperation activities .  
The extensive policy and substantive exchanges that took place on such issues as regional and subregional trade arrangements , " growth triangles " and special economic and free-trade zones led to the adoption of the Bali Declaration and a Plan of Action on this urgent , complex subject .  
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres . 
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;

the same emphasis , and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Recalling that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad _ based dialogue involving all concerned actors ,  
They are guaranteed the right to establish and use their own mass media , cultural , educational , language and religious institutions , and to establish and foster unhindered relations and maintain peaceful contacts with co-nationals outside the Yugoslav borders , as well as the right to participate at the national , regional and local levels .  
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .

Other areas of UNICEF action include increasing internal and external resources to water and environmental sanitation programmes at the country and regional level , advocating the commitment of higher resources to the sector , promoting subregional collaboration among countries and working to help reach the un-served by expanding coverage through participatory community-based approaches and supporting innovative financing mechanisms for sustainability and equity .  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
Under the overall objective of assisting developing countries to address emerging challenges and persistent problems , the objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to conduct development policy analysis , particularly in the examination of changes in domestic economic conditions and of regional and international developments that have a bearing on them .  
Enhance the capacity of institutions in developing countries to formulate development strategies by strengthening their ability to monitor national subregional , regional and international macroeconomic trends and incorporate them into the national framework for economic and social policy-making ;  
This will reinforce existing South / South networks and create opportunities for experts to learn from rapid substantive and technological changes in the field of statistics ; strengthen regional capability to produce analytical reports ; improve the ability of national institutions to produce relevant statistics ; and ensure capability to share information and results .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
With the rapid accumulation of satellite technology and the resulting expansion in Koreas space programme , a wide range of international cooperative activities are being implemented by the Republic of Korea and other countries at the regional and global levels .  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
In reviewing items 8 ( a ) - ( c ) , special attention will be paid to the scientific and technological developments that have taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular developing countries , with regard to global , regional and national issues .  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .  
Despite the cross _ regional support for such a mechanism , despite the assurances that its deliberations on nuclear disarmament would not impinge on the bilateral nuclear disarmament process , despite the safeguards provided by the rule of consensus in the CD and despite a continual lowering of ambitions in relation to the scope of work on nuclear disarmament , a consensus has not so far proved attainable .  
In the same resolution , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stressed that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
International and regional conferences and meetings , in particular the twelfth World AIDS Conference , held in Geneva in June 1998 , provided an effective forum for drawing global attention to the major gaps in action on the epidemic and to the very significant role that young people can play in shaping the global response .  
Proceeding from these ideas , it is assumed that a democratic society requires the existence and free exercise of certain basic individual and group rights and freedoms , which the Universal Declaration and the International Covenants - not to mention at this juncture other international , regional and national human rights instruments , norms and standards - define and thereby indicate their limits .  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
Like previous regional urban forums , the Third Forum would include representatives of national and local governments , private sector businesses , civil society organizations , including NGOs , academic and training institutes , and the media .  
ESCWAs mainstream activities in the population , social and women-related areas are being linked with the programmed activities outlined in a three-year extrabudgetary flagship project on integrated follow-up to global conferences , which was formulated by ESCWA and supported by UNDP to forge a regional link for Arab States between the global vision and national endeavours to pursue the recommendations of global conferences . 
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
In this statement , ACC underscored that the concept of sustainable development provided an over-arching policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations system-wide activities at the global , regional and country levels ( para . 2 ) , and called for the implementation of interrelated policies promoting economic development , improved social equity and environmental sustainability .  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
Subsequently , the General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 192 , paragraph 41 , stressed the growing need for incorporating the regional and subregional dimension in United Nations operational activities for development , and encouraged resident coordinators , in close consultation with Governments , to secure greater involvement of the regional commissions , taking into account their agreed mandates and work programmes , in UNDAF , as appropriate .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
As indicated above , this important dimension of the work of the regional commissions as part of their respective regional institutional landscape was acknowledged and endorsed by the Council in its resolution 1998 / 46 , annex III , paragraph 12 , in which the Council encouraged the regional commissions to intensify their cooperation and regular exchange of information as determined by their respective intergovernmental bodies , with relevant regional bodies , institutions and networks .  
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
The Tokyo Agenda for Action , adopted by the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development , held in October 1998 , also established a number of priorities based on widespread consultation among African and Asian Governments and the private sector , donor countries and international and regional organizations in a series of preparatory activities prior to the Conference . 
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
Forms of participation by resident non-citizens should also be developed , including local voting rights after a certain period of residence and inclusion of elected non-citizen observers in municipal , regional and national legislative and decision-making assemblies ;  
Governments at local , regional and national levels should recognize the role of multiple identities in contributing to open communities and in establishing useful distinctions between public institutional structures and cultural identities ;  
We note that countries in the region participating in the Stability Pact commit themselves to continued democratic and economic reforms , as well as bilateral and regional cooperation among themselves to advance their integration , on an individual basis , into Euro-Atlantic structures .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .

Cuba is aware of the possible dangers attendant upon any use of radioactive waste , which would be tantamount to radiological war , and of the effects of such use on national , regional and international security , and especially the security of the developing countries ; and also of the inherent threat to the preservation of the environment .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .

Strengthening and supporting the activities of the regional centres , established at the initiative of the United Nations pursuant to General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , calls for concerted effort by various agencies with a view to sustaining , inter alia , their educational activities , infrastructure development and the institutional and organizational framework .  
With this in mind , educational and training activities should be strengthened and supported by bilateral and multilateral programmes adapted to domestic needs , which should also consider the strenghthening of such as the regional training centres for space science and technology education established with the assistance of the United Nations .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .

These limited opportunities had largely been due to the fact that a significant portion of market access opportunities had been allocated to pre-selected countries , which were historical exporter countries ( according to the current access opportunity provision ) and / or countries that received preferential treatment under regional or bilateral trade preferences ; and the TRQ system had not been administered transparently and had been inefficient in achieving the full utilization of TRQs . 
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .  
Underscore the importance of compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law in the conduct of all peacekeeping operations by urging that Member States disseminate instructions among their personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations and among those participating in authorized operations conducted under national or regional command and control .

It has also contributed actively to a number of international and regional funds established to promote economic and social development in various countries of the world , including the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development , the Islamic Development Bank and other financial and economic institutions established for that purpose , and which the State of Kuwait is diligently supporting so that they can achieve the noble , humanitarian aims for which they were established . 
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
Three projects were undertaken by a central or local government responsible for gender matters , while the remaining are being implemented by local , national , regional , or international non-governmental organizations .

Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The conference will provide an ideal opportunity for a cooperative partnership to be established among Governments , international and regional organizations and the non-governmental community to mobilize public and political support to address the problems associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
With respect to the latter , the last workshop , held in February this year in New Delhi , recommended that an inter-sessional regional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights and on steps to be taken in this regard at the national and international levels be organized .

In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;

Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .

In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
The profile should contain data on non-governmental organization participation such as geographical distribution : national , regional , international ; functional specialization ; size ; duration of existence and so on , as part of a system of frequent data gathering about non-governmental organization activities and their level of cooperation with the United Nations .  
Regional economic and social commissions should become better skilled at developing non-governmental organization relations at the regional and national levels , with a view to constructing policy and operational partnerships at those levels in implementing United Nations decisions and programmes as well as outcomes of international conferences ;  
We in Saint Lucia strongly support the continued participation of these Territories in regional institutions as a natural function of our ongoing Caribbean integration process , and as a critical component of the economic , social and constitutional development of the Caribbean .

The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
Within this food and nutritional security plan , PAHO / WHO is promoting mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of existing legislation , as well as the technical norms of the World Trade Organization with respect to food quality , processing , biological , toxicological and nutritional protection and standards for industrial food products .

Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
For combating such negative phenomena as drugs , organized crime and money-laundering , strengthened international cooperation by combining national efforts , the adoption of multilateral norms and international codes of conduct , as appropriate , and the development of multilateral regional or subregional cooperation , wherever suitable , are obvious areas requiring ongoing United Nations initiatives and action .

Moreover , Mexico has promoted the initiatives included in resolution 53 / 77 Y at both the regional and international levels , especially those intended to underline the extreme urgency of initiating negotiations on nuclear disarmament and the adoption of a consistent action programme that will lead us to a world free of nuclear weapons .  
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
This common approach both preventive and reactive is comprised of multiple and coordinated international , regional and national efforts that contribute to sustainable peace in areas prone or affected by conflict .  
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .

All international disputes and regional conflicts should be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through peaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of equality , rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of force based on the power of military superiority .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .  
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme and other relevant international and regional organizations : ( i ) to promote the participation of target groups in the design of projects and facilitate the sharing of information on best strategies ; and ( ii ) to facilitate the creation of an international network promoting regular contact among youth involved in demand reduction activities and allowing them to stay informed and learn from one another .

The Minister explained , however , that , while the legislation in force in Cameroon since what was generally known as the Afreedoms session @ of the National Assembly ( 1990 ) guaranteed the basic rights and freedoms enshrined in various international and regional instruments , the task of creating a genuine human rights culture , not only among the forces of law and order but also among the public , still lay ahead . 
Welcomes the increased cooperation between the Agency and international and regional organizations , States and relevant agencies and non-governmental organizations , which is essential to enhancing the contributions of the Agency towards improved conditions for the refugees and thereby the social stability of the occupied territory ;

Emphasizes that while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The non-fulfilment of the payments determined by the law , as well as the non-elimination of the existing discrimination in the professional regimes , are punishable by fines ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Portuguese escudos , to be applied by the regional centres of social security .

Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , including through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;

These benefits were exchanged for performance standards related to export targets , local content requirements , debt-equity ratio ceilings , national ownership floors , operating scale minima , investment timetable obligations , regional location criteria and , eventually , product quality specifications and environmental rules .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;

The Subcommittee , while respecting the principles set out in article 3 , is encouraged to cooperate for the prevention of torture in general with the relevant United Nations organs and mechanisms as well as international , regional and national institutions or organizations working towards strengthening the protection of persons from torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .  
An expert group meeting , convened from 31 March to 2 April 1998 , in cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , reviewed a comprehensive overview of the range of problems and issues which need to be addressed to improve statistics on paid and unpaid work , and defined activities which the project could carry out at the international , regional and national levels .  
It considered the important developments taking place within the global economic system , the accelerated pace of liberalization in the multilateral trading system and the increasing emergence of regional and international economic blocs .  
Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;

Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize adequate technical assistance and funding and to utilize fully existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote the mobilization of adequate technical assistance and funding and the full utilization of existing international funds for the effective implementation of national and regional high-priority projects in the area of renewable sources of energy ;  
Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
Based on the many discussions I have had with the parties and others concerned , it is my understanding that the existing areas of United Nations activity in the Middle East , from assistance to refugees and regional development activities to peacekeeping missions , as well as some additional areas of activity , are likely to be raised by the parties themselves in the forthcoming rounds of negotiations .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
The development process requires a certain degree of political stability , peace and security at the national , regional and international levels , as well as the establishment of fair and equitable economic relations between States and solid international cooperation , aimed , inter alia , at helping the poorer States to boost their economies and give effect to the right to development .  
Recalling further that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad-based dialogue involving all concerned actors .  
Recalling further that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad-based dialogue involving all concerned actors ,  
The diversity of national and regional paths of change , leading to a significant variety of post-socialist emerging capitalisms ( Magnin , 1999 ) , illustrates the role of idiosyncratic and evolving institutional configurations that represent the very content of systemic change .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing the negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Emphasizes that it is important for sovereign risk assessments made by private sector agencies to be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Likewise , on the future of the regional bureaux , I am convinced of the need for strong regional representation at the level of Assistant Secretary-General in New York and I intend to select and recommend to the Secretary-General senior figures to fill the posts that are currently vacant .  
The Executive Committee will assume a more active oversight role of UNDP activities in a select number of key crisis situations ; in these countries , corporate policy will be jointly designed by the regional bureau concerned and ERD with regular feedback to the Executive Committee .  
Russia was firmly convinced that the successful development of international cooperation in space on a regional and bilateral basis and its establishment on a long-term legal foundation were no substitute for the progressive development and modification of universal norms and principles of such cooperation .  
On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
The Mexican Government , which accorded high priority to promoting the full participation of women in social , economic , political and cultural life on a par with men , devoted significant resources to programmes designed to eliminate poverty using a gender-specific perspective , and to training women in non-traditional activities ; it was also encouraging independent employment and the creation of microbusinesses , in view of regional , social and gender realities .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
Along with an explanation of the global framework and its regional organizational arrangement , the report will include concise methodological notes on how each regional comparison was aggregated and how the comparisons were brought together within a consistent and readily comparable framework .  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
It was therefore important to reinforce regional and international cooperation in combating drugs and essential to assist developing countries whether drug producing or otherwise in the administrative , judicial , economic and social areas , among other things by sharing information on investigation techniques , crop substitution , detoxification and reintegration of drug addicts into society .  
In resolution 54 / 93 , the General Assembly invited Governments and relevant organizations , in particular UNICEF , as well as regional and subregional organizations , to undertake reviews of progress achieved since the World Summit for Children and encouraged appropriate national , regional and international preparatory activities with a view to contributing to the preparations for the special session and building partnerships for and with children .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
It was further agreed that , to advance the work of the Council on the draft regulations , the Secretary-General would consult with the incoming President of the Council and with the regional groups and interest groups with a view to identifying the main areas of difficulty in the current draft and the most efficient working method which would enable the outstanding issues to be resolved .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
With respect to procurement by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals in excess of $ 50 , 000 but less than $ 200 , 000 ( or the specifically delegated monetary procurement limit , if it is less ) , any such procurement action must first be submitted to the applicable local Committee on Contracts for advice to , and , if satisfactory , approval by , the Chief Administrative Officer , the Chief of Administration or other applicable head of office .  
The note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45-72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
The Office is increasing its efforts to meet all outstanding requests for assistance from individual countries and new institutions , and seeking to increase effective coordination with other international agencies and regional and international organizations of national institutions in order to ensure that there is no duplication of effort .  
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
At the regional and subregional levels , the Office is undertaking a number of initiatives , including a joint project with the Council of Europe focusing on preventive activities for Central and Eastern Europe ; a range of activities in the former Yugoslavia coordinated by the human rights office in Sarajevo ; and a joint project with UNDP in Nepal focusing on the legal and judicial aspects of controlling trafficking .  
The proposed resources reflect a net growth of $ 701 , 400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
The Commission focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
They will continue as usual to follow their economic , educational , political and social development plans and programmes , knowing that the end of the twentieth century will not automatically mean an end to current regional conflicts .  
Among the activities promoted by local and regional authorities , labour unions and non-governmental organizations were international and national conferences on the issues associated with ageing , ranging from broad cultural and social debates to more focused discussions of the specific economic , medical and psychological concerns of the elderly .  
Subsequently , at meetings held in Bolivia , Paraguay and Panama , the heads of State and Government of the Rio Group reaffirmed regional determination to combat and overcome poverty , as well as their conviction that a sustained process of economic and social development is the only guarantee of improving peoples quality of life and of democratic stability in Latin America . 
We must give special attention to following up the results achieved at Geneva next June , with a particular eye to translating the agreements from the global perspective of the General Assembly to their regional and national dimensions , with a view to consolidating a political culture in favour of social progress , to use the phrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked the beginning of the social Summit .  
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
This policy would open the economy to market forces while at the same time restoring the valuable contribution of social action ; it would be geared to a gradual reduction of the imbalances and inequities of our current reality and to the transformation of relations between the State and civil society ; it would promote greater participation of communities in development efforts at the local and regional levels .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
In this decade the international legal order has been further developed , a number of new States have emerged , the new role and growing strength of the regional organizations has been confirmed , and strong emphasis has been placed on human rights .  
We are happy to conclude from the Secretary-Generals report that these advances of democracy have been strengthened in spite of internal social difficulties , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
In their recent joint declaration , the Presidents of the Central American countries expressed their resolve to undertake coordinated action on such crucial issues as protecting the human rights of migrants , combating drug trafficking and moving forward towards regional economic integration .  
Political , social and economic transformation now present us with a Central America free from armed conflict , a Central America with strengthened democratic institutions and a Central America in which peace , the protection of human rights and regional integration have been established on a solid footing .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
My delegation intends to play an active role in the preparations for the informal process , seeking to ensure broad input from all relevant actors , including regional organizations , various parts of the United Nations and the major groups identified in Agenda 21 , including civil society .  
The action plan could include management initiatives for regional fisheries bodies , monitoring and surveillance , penalties , port access arrangements , boat and gear identification , vessel registers , independent observers , product certification , trade and marketing documentation and memorandums of understanding between producing and consuming countries.Illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing is a difficult issue for Governments to deal with . 
In view of the recent dramatic collapse of many regional fisheries and the deterioration of many economies based on fisheries , we are concerned about illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing also called IUU fishing especially by vessels which are not members of regional fisheries organizations or arrangements or by reflagged vessels owned by nationals of Member States .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
This is eloquent proof that the international community is capable of an active search for appropriate responses to meet great challenges and for ways to tackle pressing regional problems .  
It has continued to pay special attention to the small Territories and to recommend the most suitable steps which would enable the people of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination ; it has taken steps to enlist worldwide support among Governments and regional , national and international organizations to achieve the objectives of the Declaration and to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
In the social and economic fields , the United Nations plays a unique role in the development process on the African continent by continuously supporting the building of the OAUs institutional capacities to promote regional economic integration of the States of Africa and to enhance the continents ability to take advantage of international and bilateral initiatives to promote development .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
The League of Arab States was a participant in regional and international preparatory meetings relating to population issues , which demonstrates our deep interest in this subject and our conviction that it is the role of mankind to work towards social development and to participate in political and national security affairs whether in our region or in the world at large .  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Urges the Secretary-General , in collaboration with relevant United Nations bodies , to organize , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , regional expert group meetings with a view to developing gender - and age-disaggregated and gender-sensitive psychosocial and mental health situation analyses and indicators as bases for determining progress in womens and girls emotional well-being and mental health ;  
The Commission urges relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
Some delegations expressed continued support for improving the operation of GESAMP , while noting at the same time that regional approaches were most practical for improving access to sound scientific understanding .  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
Promoting broad-based sustainable development through tourism while safeguarding the integrity of local cultures and protecting the environment requires an effective partnership between key stakeholders at the local , national , regional and international levels and participation at all levels of tourism planning , development and assessment .  
The Commission may wish to express its recognition of outstanding development issues and constraints related to sustainable energy development , which should facilitate sustainable energy policies to be formulated and implemented , especially at the national level within a regional context .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
Although economic instruments are primarily applied at the national and local levels , they can be adapted in an efficient manner at the regional and international levels .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
With regard to the development and diffusion of biotechnology , it was emphasized that , while national level research and development efforts were critical in order to ensure , among other things , that local conditions were taken into account , knowledge-sharing through North-South and South-South partnership and networking and regional initiatives were crucial for effective transfer and diffusion of technology .  
Young women and men should therefore be involved from childhood in decisions relating to their own lives , and step by step in democratic decisions for their school , their community , in local national social and cultural organizations as well as at the national , regional and international levels .

The meeting also considered that the effective implementation of agreements required appropriate institutional arrangements at the national and regional levels as well as the financial and technical support of the international community .  
Adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999,3 the text contained in the annex to the present decision as a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process , on the understanding that the preliminary agenda is of an indicative nature and will evolve during the substantive preparatory process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  3 Paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 reads as follows :  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Exploring innovative sources for financing for development : considering innovative global instruments , including tax cooperation and global public goods financing mechanisms ; enhancing the contribution of multilateral development institutions , in particular the World Bank and regional development banks , in financial innovation in support of development ; promoting national and international public / private partnerships .  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,  
Consideration of global public goods that is based on solid assessment of public goods needs , outlining the value added and comparative advantage of new efforts , taking into account the existing experiences of national , regional and international efforts in order to avoid duplication .  
While we understand that armed conflict may occur within States , we do not agree to limiting the concept of prevention to intra-State conflict , given that continuing , potentially explosive regional and international situations require major efforts to prevent them from erupting into global armed conflicts .  
The Commission acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development considered agenda item 3 , entitled Progress in preparatory activities for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , as well as by major groups , jointly with agenda item 6 , entitled Process for setting the agenda and determining possible main themes for the Summit in a timely manner . 
The Commission acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development considered agenda item 6 , entitled Process for setting the agenda and determining possible main themes for the Summit in a timely manner jointly with agenda item 3 , entitled Progress in preparatory activities for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , as well as by major groups ( see chap .  III ) .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 55 / 199 , of 20 December 2000 , which laid out the terms of reference for the preparatory process for the World Summit , and emphasizing the need for an open , participatory and fully transparent preparatory process at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ,  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish and operate regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Welcomes the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the pilot project on the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations , 18 and also welcomes the extensive network of partnerships established with local , regional and national broadcasters in Member States , and concurs with the Secretary-General that the implementation of the project has been one of the more successful examples of the reorientation of the Department of Public Information ;  
Also calls upon States and regional economic integration organizations to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the United Nations Environment Programme in order to support the interim arrangements and the operation of the Conference of the Parties until the end of the fiscal year in which the first meeting of the Conference of Parties takes place , and to ensure the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the further work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ;  
Requests the Executive Director to organize the first intergovernmental review meeting on the status of the implementation of the Global Programme of Action in November 2001 with participation of Governments , international governmental and non-governmental organizations , international and regional financing institutions , private sector and other stakeholders and major groups , paying due attention to the use of innovative financial mechanisms for implementing the Global Programme of Action and to promote the involvement of Governments , the private sector , international financial institutions and the civic society in addressing this issue ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
As to his own preventive role , the Secretary-General thinks that it could be enhanced by increasing the use of interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile areas ; by developing regional prevention strategies with regional partners and the relevant United Nations organs and agencies ; by establishing an informal network of eminent persons ; and by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
Other actors , such as regional organizations , the international financial institutions and civil society , also have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of Member States to strengthen their capacity to respond to factors such as exclusion and inequality , which , if left unchecked , can spark violent confrontations .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
If international and regional conflicts were once a result of the cold-war climate that then prevailed , the past decade , which saw the end of the cold war , was marked by regional and civil strife that was more brutal , more tragic and more devastating than the conflicts of the cold-war era .  
Instead of responding to the repeated calls of regional and international organizations that it take the necessary steps to demonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other neighbouring countries and that it change its political and informational language with a view to establishing an atmosphere of confidence , Iraq at the Arab summit held in Jordan last March rejected the inclusion of a paragraph in the final declaration renewing its commitment to guaranteeing the security and sovereignty of the State of Kuwait . 
For all genuine regional and international efforts to succeed in Somalia , it becomes necessary that all actors reach a common , objective and unbiased vision about the real tasks ahead .  
We pay tribute to the efforts of Djibouti and its President for their tireless efforts leading to the convening of the Somalia National Peace Conference in Arta , where , for the first time , a sound and correct foundation was laid for achieving consensus among 5,000 Somalis representing all social , religious , ethnic and regional factions throughout Somalia .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
The Council looks forward to receiving information on the financial implications of the follow-on mission and a detailed assessment of shared responsibilities among the principal interacting players , i.e . the United Nations system , international financial institutions , regional mechanisms and national donors in their efforts to assist East Timor in its unprecedented transition to self-government .  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
We are convinced that the United Nations should play the central role in facilitating the transformation of Afghanistan into a normal , stable and prosperous state not only because averting the threat to regional and international security emanating from Taliban-controlled territory falls squarely within the purview of the Security Council and the General Assembly , but also because we believe that only within the context of the United Nations can we find practical solutions that would be acceptable to all parties to the peace process , thereby ensuring the parties cooperation in their implementation .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
The participants in the regional workshops have included : representatives of institutions involved in disaster reduction , civil protection and emergency response activities ; representatives of international and regional organizations involved in supporting disaster management ; representatives of space agencies with activities related to disaster management ; and experts in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communications and positioning via satellites .  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
It expressed satisfaction at the progress made , and it affirmed its genuine desire to advance the GCC process in order to keep pace with ongoing changes at the regional and international levels so as to achieve the worthy aspirations and objectives set forth in the GCC Statute .  
The Scientific Committees mandate included review of published scientific reports and technical documents with the aim of assessing regional and global levels of human exposure to radiation and its potential harmful effects .  
UNIFEM believed that it was critical for women to take part in shaping the policies and practices that governed national , regional and global agreements in such areas as social responsibility of corporations , new trade agreements , reconstruction of societies emerging from war , or actions to respond to the scourge of HIV / AIDS . Womens voices and priorities must be heard .  
The comprehensive agenda of the Committee , spanning the domestic , regional and global dimensions of economic , social and cultural rights , bodes well for the future , as does the immense interest shown for bridging the gap between the rhetoric on economic , social and cultural rights and the operative priorities at all levels . 
Content : Structural features and trade flows , regional and international trade ; the changing role of commodities and services ; trade facilitation , information technology and transport and logistics ; e-commerce ; trade and environment policies , trade and environment in the World Trade Organization ( selected WTO agreements , dispute settlement , built-in agenda ) ; market access ; TRIPS ; traditional knowledge ; as well as the positive agenda and basic elements for the formulation of a developing country trade policy .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
The ability of the Office of the High Commissioner to take action must be strengthened in order to further the realization of economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights and to reinforce coordination between the Office and other international and regional organizations with a view to facilitating better analysis of the situation in that area and the adoption of preventive measures .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
A final meeting , hosted by the Government of Austria in Vienna in January 1998 , widened the consultative process still further and included legal experts from the various geographic regions as well as representatives from a broad cross-section of relevant United Nations and other international agencies , regional organizations and NGOs . 
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
Determined to alleviate the plight of populations in the regions of the world besieged by armed conflicts and criminality , which are fuelled by illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , in a manner that would bring the benefits of social and economic development and national , regional and international stability ,  
She also requested additional information on the nature of the regional thematic round tables , which were to be held in conjunction with selected interactive thematic sessions .  
For each State or regional economic integration organization ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to this Protocol after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of such action , this Protocol shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of deposit by such State or organization of the relevant instrument or on the date this Protocol enters into force pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article , whichever is the later . 
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .  
The member countries had at their disposal various regional and international legal instruments to guide them in the defence and promotion of the rights of the child , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which had been ratified by all the member countries of the Rio Group , and the instruments drawn up by the Inter-American Childrens Institute , founded in 1927 with the aim of supporting policies relating to childhood , fostering the bonds between the State and civil society , and shaping a regional awareness of the problems of children . 
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya considered that regional efforts should be focused on ensuring that scientific achievements in the nuclear field were used for peaceful purposes and hoped that a regular exchange between countries of information on the research undertaken would be set up .  
Algeria , which had always encouraged the international community to combat the scourge of terrorism in strict accordance with the principles of international law , had adopted national measures , acceded to relevant regional and international conventions and was trying to fully fit in with the frameworks of cooperation established at all levels .  
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
Accordingly , the Executive Committee agreed to entrust their regional managers with the effective monitoring of CCAs and UNDAFs in their respective regions and to task them proactively to provide the necessary support to their country representatives , to contribute to and use the results of the CCA / UNDAF Learning Network on a systematic basis and to continue their joint inter-agency meetings and reports to the Executive Committee either on a quarterly or a biannual basis .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
To promote Mauritius as a regional hub for financial and business services , participants called for policies that focused on creating capacity for rapid response in particular , accelerating the privatization programme , removing red tape , and keeping business and telecommunications costs down , as well as strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) by increasing quality and innovation for a quick turnaround in value-added activities .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
The Secretary-Generals report on facilities management ( A / 54 / 628 ) provided updated information on the major global properties owned , leased or rented at principal duty stations and regional commissions , including the current replacement value of each property and issues related to the long-range maintenance , alteration , improvement and expansion of existing buildings .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The current achievements in spatial standards were presented , with emphasis on their goals to support understanding of the use of geographic information , increase availability access , integration and sharing of geographic information , and assist in the establishment of spatial data infrastructure at the local , regional , and global levels .  
The challenge for the cartographic / SDI community is not only knowing how to harness the enormous potential of geographic information / SDI technologies but also having the ability to restructure national mapping agencies and other governmental organizations to cooperate with one another and to create regional and global data infrastructure standards .  
Emphasizing the urgent need for recognition of the collective and shared responsibility of the international community in addressing the root causes of the drug problem and threats related thereto in a comprehensive manner through an intersectoral approach and coordination at the national , regional and international level ,  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The increasing problems of organized crime , illegal trafficking , economic stagnation and political instability can be adequately dealt with only within a regional framework and with a unified international approach .  
The importance that regional workshops undertaken within the Framework be accompanied by concrete and sustainable subregional and national activities , as well as by training and awareness programmes for government officials and key professional groups such as the police , prison officials , educators , judges , lawyers , and parliamentarians , was also recognized .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
The increase of $ 141,600 includes the delayed impact of the new posts established in the biennium 2000-2001 and the reclassification of the post of the Chief of the Unit , which is responsible for the implementation of the subprogramme , from the P-5 level to D-1 , to reflect the increased responsibilities of the post and its greater professional interaction at the national , regional , subregional and inter-agency levels .  
The reclassification reflects the substantive nature of the tasks involved , as well as increased responsibilities and greater professional interaction with regional representatives of United Nations programmes and agencies , resident coordinators , high-level government officials at the country level and chief executives and senior staff of the regional economic communities , intergovernmental organizations and NGOs .  
Objective : To promote the development of statistics at the national level and coordinate them at the regional level in order to effectively meet planning , policy-making and administrative requirements for addressing emerging national and regional economic and social priorities .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Urges Governments and regional organizations to make use of the limited international special surveillance list of substances established by the Board , adapted or supplemented , where appropriate , by lists of chemicals subject to voluntary monitoring , to reflect national and regional situations and changing trends in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism .  
Monitoring the implementation of sustainable development goals through the assessment of data collected at the national , regional and international levels is one of the main objectives of the Division for Sustainable Development . 16 As decided by the Commission on Sustainable Development in 1993 , the Division invites Governments and organizations to submit the relevant information to the Commission . 
Representatives of national councils on sustainable development who met at a forum , organized in conjunction with the eighth session of the Commission would have welcomed a longer lead time and more thorough regional consultations in advance of the meeting to consolidate better their respective positions on the issues considered at the Commission .  
The Vienna Declaration contains the commitment to develop comprehensive crime prevention strategies at the international , national , regional and local levels to address the root causes and risk factors of crime and victimization through social , economic , health , educational and justice policies ( para .  25 ) .  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
The following priorities were identified during the operational segment : first , increased priority was to be assigned to demand reduction ; secondly , increased support was to be provided to Governments in countering the threat of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS ; and thirdly , at the regional level , increased attention should be given to countering the drug problem in Africa , without neglecting other regions where UNDCP was currently operating .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Urges the international community , including regional organizations , to undertake a greater and more determined financial and technical cooperation effort to support and promote alternative development projects , drawn up as part of national programmes , on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility as a pillar of international cooperation in countering the world drug problem ;  
Emphasizing that at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , States undertook to promote multilateral , regional , subregional , and bilateral cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities to deal with criminal organizations involved in drug-related offences ,  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
On the basis of the Pact and goals of the League of Arab States , in an atmosphere of mutual understanding , brotherhood and sincerity , the leaders studied the state of the Nation , the challenges confronting it and the situation in the region and took a comprehensive inventory of regional and international circumstances , focusing on promoting Arab solidarity , reactivating the institutions of joint Arab endeavour , upholding the interests and rights of the Nation and maintaining Arab national security .  
In the interests of enabling the League of Arab States to fulfil its mission , perform its tasks , implement its programmes and carry out its activities , the leaders charged the Secretary-General of the League with taking the necessary steps and proposing appropriate formulas for the reform of all financial , administrative and organizational aspects of the General Secretariat of the League with a view to restructuring it , enhancing its working methods and performance and enabling it to address national requirements and keep pace with new developments at the regional and international levels . 
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional and sectoral levels .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
By its decision 1 / 1 , the Committee adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 , a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process as contained in the annex to that decision , on the understanding that this preliminary agenda was of an indicative nature and would evolve during the substantive process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  
Section I contains information on the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council , which have been grouped , on the basis of their institutional status , into seven categories : ( a ) functional commissions , ( b ) regional commissions , ( c ) standing committees , ( d ) ad hoc committees , ( e ) expert bodies composed of governmental experts , ( f ) expert bodies composed of members serving in their personal capacity and ( g ) related bodies .  
Welcoming the announced reduction of the United Army Group in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation and the number of checkpoints , and also welcoming the re-establishment of a judicial system with a supreme court , and regional and city courts in the Republic of Chechnya , the increased involvement of ethnic Chechens in the police forces as well as the mixed composition at checkpoints ,  
Urges the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure international , regional and national humanitarian organizations , notably those of the United Nations and their implementing partners as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross , free , unimpeded and secure access to the Republic of Chechnya and neighbouring republics of the Russian Federation , in accordance with international humanitarian law , and to facilitate their activities , including the delivery of humanitarian aid , inter alia by simplifying regulations , and their access to a radio communication network for the United Nations ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
In Economic and Social Council resolution 2000 / 35 , the Council decided to invite executive heads of relevant organizations of the United Nations system and heads of other relevant international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments to form a collaborative partnership on forests to support the work of UNFF and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants , and facilitate and promote coordinated and cooperative action , including joint programming .  
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .  
The trust fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , intergovernmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations , as well as to natural and juridical persons .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
This initiative is expected to promote regional integration through enhancing the collective value of small and fragmented markets in the creation of trade and the expansion of exports ; develop shared infrastructure ; and tackle common environmental and social problems .  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .

In order to promote informed decision-making by central , regional or local authorities in proceedings concerning accidental pollution of transboundary inland waters , countries should facilitate participation of the public likely to be affected in hearings and preliminary inquiries and the making of objections in respect of proposed decisions , as well as recourse to and standing in administrative and judicial proceedings .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
The President also informed members that , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , entities of the United Nations system , including programmes , funds , specialized agencies and regional commissions , with specific expertise in the subject matter of the special session , might make statements in the debate in plenary , provided that they were represented at the highest level .  
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .  
I encourage the Security Council to consider innovative mechanisms , such as establishing a subsidiary organ , an ad hoc informal working group or other informal technical arrangement to discuss prevention cases on a continuing basis , particularly with regard to periodic regional or subregional reports that I intend to submit to the Council , as well as other early warning or prevention cases brought to its attention by Members States .  
With the support of Member States , I intend to enhance the traditional preventive role of the Secretary-General in four ways : first , by increasing the use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile regions ; second , by developing regional prevention strategies with our regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies ; third , by establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention ; and fourth , by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional , subregional and sectoral levels .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Noting with grave concern that Africa , in particular sub-Saharan Africa , is currently the worst affected region where HIV / AIDS is considered as a state of emergency , which threatens development , social cohesion , political stability , food security and life expectancy and imposes a devastating economic burden and that the dramatic situation on the continent needs urgent and exceptional national , regional and international action ;  
Acknowledging that prevention of HIV infection must be the mainstay of the national , regional and international response to the epidemic ; and that prevention , care , support and treatment for those infected and affected by HIV / AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response and must be integrated in a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic ;  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We underline the essential contribution of independent specialized bodies at national , regional or local levels in promoting equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin or religious background ;  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
Furthermore it urges them to work in partnership at the national , regional and international levels to develop appropriate policy tools that facilitate the development of legislation , policies and programmes that take into account ethnic , racial , linguistic , religious and cultural diversity ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
These include the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , the development , together with relevant regional organizations , of regional preventive strategies and the establishment of an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
The Special Committee therefore regards this regional seminar as a critical first step in this second International Decade , as we proceed to devise international strategies in a concerted effort to ensure that this sacred right to self-determination , this basic human right , is realized in all of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , so that the people might achieve their full political equality consistent with recognized international standards .

Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Recalling that the goals and targets in the economic , social and related fields contained in the Millennium Declaration [ 2 ] and the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits , supplemented by the outcomes of their reviews , constitute a comprehensive basis for actions at the national , regional and international levels ,  
The subjects addressed included study of the background to the approach of the United Nations to the phenomenon of mercenaries ; the state of international legislation on that subject , with special emphasis on article 47 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions , regional legislation , particularly the Organization of African Unity Convention ; national legislation and evaluation of the means used to implement existing legislation .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
The Preparatory Committee drew up a list of participants in the conference , including all Member States of the United Nations and observers , the various related components of the United Nations secretariat , specialized agencies , UNESCO chairs in the field of human rights and interreligious dialogue , treaty and non-treaty human rights mechanisms regional organizations , international organizations of an educational or cultural nature , national and regional human rights institutes , national human rights commissions , and experts from religious or confessional groups and non-governmental organizations .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
The Syrian Arab Republic advocates transparency in armaments as a means of enhancing international peace and security and believes that , in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain well-defined basic principles : it must be balanced , comprehensive and non-discriminatory , and it must enhance the national , regional and international security of all States in conformity with international law .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
A possible strategy is to establish such a capacity gradually , by assisting in developing requisite training / pedagogical material and by providing assistance in course delivery in a developing country on a regional basis jointly with local professional associations ( freight forwarders , exporters etc . ) and / or academic institutions .  
The principal objectives of the Network are to expand mutual support , cooperation and joint activities , including through information exchanges , training and development , undertaking joint projects , sharing expertise , periodical regional meetings and seminars , and mutually assisting each other with respect to requests from other national institutions regarding human rights violations .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
The representative of Brazil stated that for Brazil , a transit country for Paraguay and Bolivia , needed concrete proposals for the creation of innovative financial instruments of the national , regional and international levels , by financial institutions operating in the region .  
The representative of Peru stated that for Peru , a transit country for Bolivian trade , there is a need to establish financial instruments at national , regional and international levels : international financial institutions could help through special and innovative programmes to support the development , improvement and maintenance of needed physical infrastructure .  
The development of a coherent , national , regional and international transport network combined with efficient transport services are essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
With regard to the role of international agreements , he pointed out that so far recognition of the importance of technology transfer for developing countries was only formal in nature , expressed solely through the existence of the relevant international and regional arrangements , but that further refinement of those arrangements was needed in order to facilitate the practical possibilities of their actual implementation .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,

Based on these principles , a set of new concepts has emerged and started to take form : a new security concept which consists in mutual trust , disarmament and cooperative security ; a new type of international relationship which centres on partnership and non-alignment ; and a new model of regional cooperation in which all countries , large or small , jointly take the initiative in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation .  
Stressing the need for the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability and friendly relations among all States , and underlining the overriding political , humanitarian and moral imperatives as well as the economic advantages of preventing the outbreak and escalation of conflicts ,  
It could be rather useful to make the CST closer to the regional and national levels by organizing , in the period between the Conferences of the Parties , the regional meetings of the CST reflecting , in more complex basis , interlinkages with the activities of relevant subsidiary bodies ( scientific and technology ) of other global conventions and regional agreements .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
Appeals to the international community , United Nations bodies , international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources , including through the new global fund to fight HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit in 2001 and by the Secretary-General , for developing countries , particularly in Africa , with a view to enabling them to fully implement the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the Roll Back Malaria initiative ;

As far as the Macedonian contribution to the joint action in combating terrorism is concerned , my Government decided to prepare draft legislation on combating terrorism and to amend already existing legislation in this area , in order to comply with relevant regional and international conventions and other decisions of the United Nations , thus acting in compliance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) .  
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
Specifically , in resolution 1355 ( 2001 ) of 15 June 2001 , the Council called on all relevant parties to ensure that urgent child protection concerns were addressed in all national , bilateral and regional dialogues and that child soldiers were expeditiously demobilized , and urged Member States to ensure adequate and sustained resources for long-term reintegration .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
Calls upon all relevant bodies , agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental , regional and subregional organizations , within their continuing mandated activities , to continue to address the issue of international migration and development and to provide appropriate support for interregional , regional and subregional processes and activities on international migration and development , with a view to integrating migration issues in a more coherent way within the broader context of the implementation of agreed economic and social development programmes ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The development of a coherent , national , regional and international transport network , combined with efficient transport services , are essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The studies point out that development of a coherent rural , national and international transport network is essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
To this end , an annual meeting at the level of permanent missions in New York , to exchange views , coordinate strategies and adopt a common regional position among member States would be an important forum in which similar experiences can be shared and solutions sought to common problems .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
The Inter-American Democratic Charter represents an important initiative , promoted by Peru , and reflects regional consensus on an unprecedented instrument which systematizes principles , norms and mechanisms for collective action , including diplomatic sanctions in cases of alteration or interruption of democratic institutionality , with a view to promoting , preserving and defending democracy from a human rights perspective .  
The Board noted that UNAFRI salary scales had been determined by the Board at its inaugural session in June 1989 , and considered that the scales should be reviewed in order to bring them in line with the scales of other comparable regional bodies , thus enabling UNAFRI to attract and retain suitably qualified and competent personnel . 
Belarus is convinced that a gradual movement from simple to more complex bilateral and multilateral measures and agreements will create a solid basis for preventing armed conflict and strengthening national and regional security , which in turn are integral elements of the modern architecture of a comprehensive and indivisible system of international security .  
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
On prospects for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture , the panellists said that enthusiasm had given way to the perception that it was virtually impossible to reach consensus on such reform , and that second-best solutions in the form of do-it-yourself approaches to crisis prevention and management at both the regional and national levels currently appeared to be the only politically feasible alternative .  
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
On 16 November of this year , heads of State and Government are expected to sign the Almaty Act , the final document of this regional forum , which reflects major aspects of cooperation : joint activities to combat new threats , including terrorism , separatism , extremism , illegal drugs and weapon trafficking ; a regional mechanism for the elaboration and application of confidence-building mechanisms in their broader meaning ; the institutionalization of the CICA , its structure , Secretariat , regular and specialized meetings , and academic and professional inputs .  
Invites the Secretary-General , the Economic and Social Council , the Commission for Social Development , the regional commissions , the relevant agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental forums , within their respective mandates , to take on a priority basis and in a coordinated manner all steps necessary to ensure the effective implementation of all commitments and undertakings contained in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action and in the further initiatives for social development , and to continue to be actively involved in their follow-up ;  
Recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of youth and youth organizations at the local , national , regional and international levels in promoting and implementing the World Programme of Action and in evaluating the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation and of the need to support the activities of youth mechanisms that have been set up by youth and youth organizations , bearing in mind that young people are active agents for positive change and development in society ;  
The use of coercive measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , whether unilaterally or under the auspices of regional and international organizations , poses a genuine threat to international peace and security and is in manifest violation of human rights principles .  
The United Nations and other organizations , whether of an international or regional character , have adopted an enormous number of resolutions condemning the use of unilateral coercive economic measures because of the great damage they do to the economies of the developing countries and their negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a just and non-discriminatory trading system .  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
His delegation called for the strengthening of regional and international mechanisms designed to contain conflicts and their destructive consequences , curb the factors that led to their outbreak and prosecute those responsible for acts involving human rights violations , terrorism , trafficking of drugs and prohibited weapons , organized crime and money-laundering , among others .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
The participants acknowledged that the spread of internal conflicts requires enhanced international and regional cooperation to tackle their root causes and committed themselves to improving coordination of their efforts in the fields of preventive action and peace-building .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .

The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .

Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Huaqiu Liu held talks with Kamyao here on the 29th .  Both parties exchanged opinions in depth regarding further developing bilateral relations and also international and regional problems that were of common concern , and they achieved widespread agreement .  
He also severely denounced some countries for putting regional organizations above the UN Security Council or even bypassing the UN Security Council to carry out military intervention in a sovereign country , pointing out that such practice has " severely damaged the existing international collective security mechanism , and the consequences are extremely dangerous . "  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .

He said that making great development in the Western Region is an important operation to expand domestic demands and promote sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy as well as an important deployment for strategically readjusting economic structure and promoting coordinated development of regional economy .  
In the course of town construction , attention should be focused on the concentration of industries and population ; through the use of regional and industrial policies , economic levers , and administrative measures , we should guide and promote the concentration of secondary and tertiary industries in towns and accept the stimulating influence of major cities so that towns ' economic and population scales will increase rapidly .  
Under the guidance of the party Central Committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in Guangxi have built a poor and backward Guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .  
After the closing of the session , a meeting will be held on 16 March to present the proposals placed on file to relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee and central state organs , provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal party committees , the people 's governments , and relevant mass organizations and units for handling .  
We should continue to uphold the principle of attaching simultaneous attention to preventing and improving pollution and protecting the ecology , strive to control the total discharge of pollutants and strengthen pollution prevention and treatment in major cities , rivers and regional sea areas in a bid to improve environmental quality and promote ecological balance .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .

through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
Particularly , the activities of national separatist organizations are getting brisker and brisker .  These organizations manage to sell weapons and narcotics , train terrorists , and even stand for fighting a " holy war . "  Their terrorist and violent nature has become conspicuous with each passing day , thus seriously threatening the regional peace and stability as well as the people 's life and property safety .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
James Gradoville , a member of the delegation and Motorola regional director of Asia-Pacific government relations , told our reporters : We have consistently emphasized to members of Congress that it should pass a " clean resolution , without strings , " to enable American business to benefit from the opening up of the China market and enable Chinese enterprises to move toward the world still better ; at the same time this will provide a new and powerful motive force for spurring the steady and healthy development of Sino-US relations .  
Ethnic conflicts , territorial disputes , and war have been continuous in the Mideast over many years , with the result that countless people have been plunged into an abyss of misery and so many families have become destitute and homeless in all the countries of the region ; this has had a serious impact on regional economic and social development and also on world peace and stability .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan held talks here today with Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa , Minister of External Relations of Mongolia . The two sides exchanged views in a cordial and friendly atmosphere on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern , and reached a common understanding over a wide range of issues .  
Under the dual impact of the two tidal waves of world economic globalization and regional blocs formation , Taiwan 's hope of sustained , stable economic development lies in the mainland of the motherland , without which Taiwan 's economic development would certainly be faced with a predicament .  A Taiwan economy that is separated from the mainland of the motherland will have no way out and will sink and emerge alternately and struggle to survive in the flood tide of world economic globalization .  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
In future regional wars , our strong adversaries who possess high-tech weaponry may engage us in aerial battles with their superior technology .  These battles will be abrupt and decisive .  Our adversaries will go all out to seize the initiative by taking full advantage of nighttime and complex weather conditions .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
Relevant State Council departments and provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments are responsible for giving guidance to their subordinate regular schools of higher learning designated to train cadres for the military .  
Provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments and relevant State Council departments should clarify the responsibilities of their subordinate functional departments and strengthen guidance for their subordinate regular schools of higher learning to train high-quality personnel for the military .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
In order to protect the safety of some particularly important or vital economic targets which bear heavily on our national or regional security , aside from employing all sorts of passive or comprehensive protection measures , we must also more vigorously build an active air defense system by focusing on the issues concerned .  
In particular , we should closely integrate our plans for protecting certain extremely important economic targets with our national territorial air defense plans , our regional air defense plans , and our urban defense plans ; should give full scope to the might of our air defense arms system ; and should intercept or annihilate the air raid arms of the enemy so as to reduce the pressure on our passive defense and ensure the safety or enhance the survival capability of our vital economic targets .  
In a new historic stage , the construction of the ranks of cadres faces many new cases and new problems , among which is the conspicuous contradiction of the scientific and technological qualities in the ranks of cadres failing to conform to the requirements for constructing our military modernization and for winning regional wars under high-tech conditions .  
As a friendly neighbor of ASEAN and a partner of mutual trust and cooperation , China has had a high regard all along for the positive role that ASEAN plays in regional affairs , respecting ASEAN 's efforts to establish a peaceful , free , and neutral region , supporting ASEAN 's economic integration , and hoping to consolidate and expand the multi-level exchanges and cooperation with ASEAN in the areas of economics and trade , science and technology , and society , etc . "  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
The state security and the people 's interests lie in building up a powerful , modernized , standardized and revolutionary army , in fully preparing for military struggles in the new stage and in winning possible future high-tech regional wars .  
During the combined " circum-Pacific " military exercises staged in June and July , the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named " Strong Angel " .  Their idea is : If two neighboring nations resort to arms , a third nation ( and its allies ) will send naval forces and marine corps to prevent the war from escalating and thus ensure regional " stability " .  They will also send food , tents , and other necessities of life to the invaded nation .  
The implication is that the US army will take part in military actions not relating to wars staged in all places throughout the world .  These actions serve as an important complement to the strategy by which the US army has won two massive regional wars .  The action comprises keeping peace , achieving peace through mandatory measures , humanitarian assistance , rescue operations at home and abroad , providing disaster relief , and fighting terrorism and narcotics .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
At the same time , China also can not sit back and watch her legitimate national security interests be damaged , but rather must take the necessary measures based on changes to the global and regional security situation To ensure the minimum level of nuclear counterstrike ability , because China absolutely will not be subject to a nuclear threat ever again .  
The world we live in today is not really at peace ; for economic , political , and other reasons , the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time ; ethnic contradictions , sectarian disputes , racial discrimination , regional conflicts , and partial wars occur from time to time and are rather serious in certain countries and regions ;  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
Therefore , the two sides will continue maintaining the momentum of high-level intercourse and contacts , deepening the mutual beneficial cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological realms , strengthening the omni-directional exchange and cooperation in all realms , and improve the communication and coordination in international and regional affairs .  
However , as Sichuan is an interior province with a large population , a weak economic foundation , an unreasonable economic structure , and an uneven condition of regional development , it is still below the average level of the whole country 's economic growth , and still lags behind the coastal areas in the east .  
unswervingly implemented the party 's policy concerning nationalities and religion and the regional national autonomy system ; increasingly consolidated and developed the new-type socialist national relationship based on equality , unity , and mutual help ; and made the dream come true in real terms for the people of all nationalities to exercise their rights according to the law in the political , economic , cultural , and social life .  
Let us jointly hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , under the leadership of the autonomous regional party committee and government and by making good use of the vigorous momentum of large-scale western development , forge ahead courageously and create more dazzling new splendors of economic and social development .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
China firmly adhered to its peaceful diplomacy of independence and self-determination , strongly advocated multipolarization in the world , and positively dealt with economic globalization .  It actively participated in regional cooperation and worked hard at creating a new international economic order that is fair and reasonable .  It devoted itself to just causes that promoted mankind 's peace and development .  
and the leaders of regional organizations .  President Jiang Zemin put forward a four-point proposal at the meeting designed to strengthen Sino-African cooperation and promote the creation of a new international economic and political order .  His proposal won universal praise from those in attendance .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Faced with an ever-worsening internal and external security situation , Russia has carried out readjustments to its diplomatic line and pursued a more active and pragmatic foreign policy , in a bid to restore Russia 's great power status and its influential role in world and regional affairs .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
Deputy Guo Jinlong said : To implement the economic and social objectives set by the autonomous regional party committee for the coming five years , the cadres and people of all nationalities in Tibet will work hard in the six aspects : First , further break seclusion , improve service , and create a good investment soft environment with innovations in thinking and structure as the guide .  
As China is a large country , with an uneven distribution of demobilized military cadres and regional differences in economic development , governments at all levels may face new issues and new problems in carrying out and implementing interim procedures .  This requires we pay attention to the fundamental interests of the Party and the country , correctly handle the relationship between regions and the overall situation , work in a creative manner and ensure solid implementation of every resettlement policy .  
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
Jiang Zemin also extended congratulations to the newly formed Thai Government and expressed his appreciation of the Thai Government 's active attitude toward developing friendly relations with China . He said : China supports Thailand 's stand to promote friendly cooperation with its neighbors and to facilitate regional dialogue and cooperation .  Jiang Zemin said he believes that Thailand will play a positive role for regional peace , stability and development .  
During his visit , he held separate meetings with President Bush , Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld , and Rice , assistant to the President for national security affairs .  They exchanged views in a frank , sincere , and in-depth way on Sino-US relations and some important international and regional issues .  
They briefed each other on their respective domestic situations and had an extensive exchange of views on further developing the relations of friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two countries of China and DPRK , on regional and international relations , and on other issues of common concern .  
Qian Qichen said : China and the United States have important common interests and assume a heavy responsibility in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and world peace and stability , preventing proliferation of mass killing weapons and vehicles for carrying them , ensuring regional and global economic stability and prosperity , and coping with international threats .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said at today 's news conference that Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , during his visit to the United States , made extensive contact with the US side and exchanged views with the US side in a frank , sincere , and extensive manner on Sino-US relations and some important international and regional issues .  The visit achieved positive and constructive results .  
After our entry into WTO , domestic agricultural markets will certainly come into contact with the international market .  Faced with the unified , large international market which has over one-hundred years of history and which enjoys increasingly sound and healthy systems and operational mechanisms , such short-comings as the split between trade , industry and agriculture , disconnects between production and marketing , and enclosed , excessive and disorderly regional competition in our domestic agricultural market which has been divided by departments and administrative regions will be fully exposed .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : Countries in East Asia and Latin American are mostly developing countries .  They have common interests and tasks .  They are all exploring a path of development commensurate with their own national conditions and seeking a regional cooperation model in conformity with their own actual conditions , and striving to usher in a more stable , equal , and fair world .  We have a common wish to use each other 's experience as reference , learn from each other , and cooperate with each other .  
The conference was attended by provincial , autonomous regional , municipal , and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps party committee secretaries , deputy secretaries in charge of political-legal work , political-legal committee secretaries , court presidents , chief procurators , public security department ( bureau ) directors , and directors of offices for comprehensive tackling of public order ;  
Personalities here believe that the benign interaction of the Chinese and Australian senior military officers will be beneficial to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries and armies and to maintaining regional security as well .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his firm belief that constant strengthening of Sino-Brazil relations not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and their people , but also conforms to the common interests of the large numbers of developing countries , and definitely will make positive contributions to lasting regional and world peace and prosperity .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is pursuing an independent foreign policy to safeguard national independence and sovereignty .  It actively takes part in international and regional affairs and promotes the integration of Latin America . It has made due contributions to world peace and development .  Here I would like to express my deep appreciation and extend my sincere congratulations .  I wish the Venezuelan people more brilliant successes in their journey ahead .  
The two sides carried out frequent exchanges at various levels , and raised economic and trade cooperation to a new stage .  In regional and international affairs , the two countries also maintained close cooperation .  A favorable tendency exists in the development of Sino-Vietnamese relations .  
Wang Zhaoguo said : Guangxi is an area inhabited by minority ethnic groups .  Because the regional party committee and the regional government attach great importance to the ethnic and religious work and exercise correct leadership , good results have been achieved in the building of new-type socialist ethnic relations of being equal , united , and mutually assistant .  
7 .  Both sides confirm that they hold identical or similar views and stands on major international and regional issues at present and are willing to strengthen the two countries ' close cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and make joint efforts toward establishing new international political and economic orders that are just and rational .  
Obviously , for the United States to engage in this kind of military activity in peacetime contravenes the basic principles of international law regarding mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , and is markedly characterized by hostility to China ; it is a threat to China 's national security and peaceful order , and an open provocation against China 's sovereignty , and it has caused a tense atmosphere affecting regional security .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
He said : China and Malaysia have maintained frequent mutual visits and contacts between the senior officials and continued to maintain close coordination and cooperation in the international and regional affairs .  
He expected that during his visit , he will have an in-depth exchange of views with Moroccan leaders on bilateral ties and major international and regional issues of common concern .  He believed that this visit will actively help consolidate and promote bilateral friendly cooperative ties .  
Some of the right wing figures in the moderate group even believed that , based on this , trade contact is helping to increase China 's overall national power and leading to an increased military threat of Taiwan by the mainland , and that the risk of the United States being involved in a regional conflict is even greater .  
Having studied some burning issues in the current international and regional situation , the foreign ministers confirm in the joint communiqu ? that they have the same position and pledge to jointly commit to the further reinforcement and continuous improvement of the cooperation among the " Shanghai Five " in international affairs .  
The foreign ministers stress that the international prestige of the " Shanghai Five " has been enhanced and it has become an increasingly influential positive factor in safeguarding regional and world peace , security , and stability .  It is also playing an important role in promoting the multipolarization of the world and establishing a new international political and economic order that is fair , reasonable , and democratic .  
The comrades in charge of pertinent departments and units under the party 's central committee and State Council and the Beijing-based comrades in charge of the backbone enterprises managed by the central authorities attended the meeting at the main conference hall .  The leading comrades from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and those from various prefectural ( city ) and county people 's governments and relevant departments attended the meeting at sub-meeting-rooms .  
With the exception of the regulations regarding change and revocation of applicable regulations in Articles 6 through 9 of these regulations , the principal responsible person and signatory of a local people 's government or its subsidiary department acting in violation of these regulations or formulating and implementing regulations that stipulate implementation of regional blockades or contain reference to regional blockades shall be given disciplinary sanctions of either demotion or dismissal in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense .  
Fees and other illegitimate income received through implementation of regional blockades as a result of abuse of administrative authority by a local people 's government or its subsidiary departments shall be returned to the applicable enterprise , other economic organization or individual ;  
Personnel of a local people 's government or its subsidiary departments who retaliate by making a false charge against a unit or individual that reports regional blockade activities shall be punished by either demotion or dismissal , up to discharge from public employment , in accordance with legal procedure and based on the severity of the offense ;  
Governments and departments concerned nationwide must unify their understanding , strictly enforce orders and prohibitions , and make concerted efforts to resolutely break down the " fences " of regional blockades and establish and perfect a nationally unified great market of fair competition and regulated order .  
Apart from the fact that the mental concepts of certain cadres are outdated and they long for the stuff of planned economy , an important reason why regional blockades persist in some areas despite repeated prohibition is that instead of doing their work in a thoroughly sound way , certain leading cadres depend on improper methods such as regional blockades to pursue " achievements in their official career , " and do not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of the masses and the state for the sake of pursuing their own benefit .  
The leading cadres at all levels in all localities must seriously study General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents , " be faithful representatives of the development requirements of the advanced social productive forces and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people , and fully understand the harm done by regional blockades .  
Comrades in charge of pertinent departments under central and state organs , comrades assigned to take charge of the work from various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments , and persons in charge of the people 's governments at prefectural , city , and county levels participated in the conference .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
fifth , the US decision to link NMD with TMD overseas is bound to harm regional peace and stability ; should the United States being Taiwan into the east Asia TMD , this will be organizing a US-Taiwan military alliance in disguise , interfering in China 's internal affairs , and increasing the tension in the Taiwan strait .  
In the future , both sides of the strait should keep in mind regional union and national reunification , eliminate political interference from separatist forces , work to promote reciprocity and mutual benefit for both sides of the strait in economics and trade , and create a new win-win and mutually beneficial situation of cooperation and exchange .  
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
Given the reality that European and American free trade areas are growing stronger by the day and that various countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region are choosing bilateral and small multilateral regional free trade as their next best choice , both sides of the strait must consider the question of forming a unique economic area under the constraints of external influences .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
He expressed the belief that , with close cooperation and unremitting efforts of both sides , the Sino-Thai relations of good neighborliness , mutual trust , and all-round cooperation will grow in strength in the coming century , which is not only beneficial to the two peoples , but also conducive to regional peace and development .  
Its missile plan is aimed at achieving its absolute military and economic superiority by means of hegemony .  To pursue this purpose , the United States does not scruple to provoke a global arms race , does not scruple to undermine the regional security of other countries , and does not scruple to break the international rules and order .  In short , for the sake of its national interests , the United States does not scruple to harm the interests of the whole world .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
According to the regulations of the Constitution and the regional national autonomy laws , after the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region , Tibet enjoys autonomy in many aspects like legislation , use of its national languages , personnel management , management and development of natural resources , and so on .  Therefore , the cultural traditions , customs and habits , languages , and so on of the people of all nationalities in Tibet have been fully respected and the political , economic , social and all other rights have been reliably safeguarded .  
Efforts should be made to develop crop cultivation and livestock breeding in the light of local conditions , do a good job in readjusting the agricultural structure , energetically bring about an industrialized operation of agriculture , and give shape to regional leading industries with distinguishing characteristics and unique features .  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government began to list famous religious activity sites including the Johkang , Thaxi Lhunbo , Drepung , Sagya , and Sera Monasteries as key cultural heritages under national or autonomous regional protection .  
Over the past five years , ASEM has held dialogues on a wide range of issues and carried out cooperation in various forms ; the Asian and the European leaders have held beneficial discussions on a series of major international and regional issues ; and the two sides have carried out exchanges and cooperated with each other in economic , trade , banking , scientific , technological , cultural , environmental , and other fields , and this has pushed forward and deepened the development of Asian-European relations . 
The work of having the 13 eastern provinces and municipalities give support to the development of the 10 western provinces and autonomous regions is an important measure to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two great prospects " to promote coordinated development of regional economy and reduce the economic gap between the east and the west regions .  
During the visit , NPC Chairman Li Peng exchanged views with leaders of the national assemblies , governments , and political parties in the three countries on strengthening bilateral relations in the new century and on the current international and regional situations .  The visit has attained the aim of enhancing friendship , expanding consensus , and strengthening cooperation .  
Raidi , chairman of the Tibet regional people 's congress standing committee , said : Currently Tibet is in the best period in history .  Tibet has been enjoying social progress , economic prosperity , and ethnic unity ; frontier defense in Tibet is ensured ; people of Tibet have been living and working in peace and contentment ; and the anti-splittism struggle has developed from being in a passive position and taking measures to cope with emergencies to taking the initiative to deal with things .  These achievements have not come by easily .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
In the event that the provincial ( regional , and municipal ) and city party committees are unable to call such a plenary meeting , their standing committees may call a similar meeting to decide on the matter .  However , before deciding on the matter , the standing committees concerned should solicit views from the members of the party committees concerned .  
President Akayev said cheerfully that the fact that the fruitful activities of the " Shanghai Five " in recent years have drawn the attention of the international community has a lot to do with its growing international prestige in the region and in the world , with our successful solution of problems in the political , military , economic , trade and other spheres , and with the tremendous role we are playing in the protection of regional security .  
Shi Guangsheng : The Foreign Trade Minister meeting is an important routine meeting of APEC that is held once every year .  Ministers and officials of every member state hold discussions and seek mutual understanding on major issues impacting global and Asia-Pacific regional economic and trade development .  The meeting serves as preparation for the Joint Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministerial meeting and the APEC Informal Leadership Meeting scheduled to be held at the end of this year .  
Supported by a total of nine regional operational control centers ( ROCC ) , including a temporary center commissioned in Iceland in 1988 , the JSS system has deployed a sensor-surveillance network , comprising a total of 85 radar , including 47 on the US territory , which are capable of monitoring areas 320 kilometers wide on the US territory and in the surrounding areas . 
Your distinguished nation has pursued a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping initiative in one 's own hands , has protected world peace and promoted joint progress , and has played an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs .  
The meeting of ministers responsible for trade among APEC member economies and the discussions on major issues concerning regional and global economic and trade development are of major significance for the maintenance of a stable and open economic and trade environment in this region and the establishment of a fair and rational new world economic order .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
Now , financial and economic officials , while continuing to uphold the " no haste , be patient " policy , have pledged that Taiwan " will become a center , not a springboard " .  How can they expect to rebuild the people 's confidence with the slogan that they will " work desperately hard for the economy " when their basic logics for regional economy are self-contradictory ?  
The development and change of the post-Cold War international security situation shows that apart from cooperative security mechanism , the other mechanisms have not played or will also impossibly play , in the real terms , the role as patron saint in regional security , because the security based on those mechanisms is built on the basis of the others ' insecurity and is the refurbished version of the historical old security mechanism with hegemonist coloration .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
It has provided a good example , which shows that all countries , large or small , can carry out regional cooperation on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit .  It has demonstrated that showing mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences is the only choice for countries with different civilization backgrounds and cultural traditions to live with each other in peace and harmony and achieve common prosperity .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
The " Shanghai Five " mechanism advocates good neighborly relations , mutual trust , equality , mutual benefits , unity , cooperation , and joint development .  It has provided the international community with valuable experience and inspiration in abandoning the Cold War mentality and in actively exploring for a new type of state-to-state relations , a new type of security view , and a new type of regional cooperation model in the post-Cold War era , and has made positive contributions to world peace and stability .  
Raidi , deputy secretary of the regional party committee , chairman of the standing committee of the regional people 's congress and first deputy head of the regional leading group for studying the important thinking of the " three represents " , summarized five special characteristics of this region in studying the " three represents " .  They are : 1 ) Party committees at various levels have attached great importance to studying the " three represents " and made effective and meticulous arrangements for promoting the education ;  
Speak highly of the positive role that the " Shanghai Five " has played with respect to promoting and deepening good neighborliness , mutual trust , and friendly relations ; and to consolidating regional security and stability and promoting common development between member countries ever since its establishment five years ago ;  
The ministers held that the fruitful military cooperation between the SCO member states sets a good example of a new kind of regional military cooperation suitable to modern trends in the post-Cold War era .  It is not only conducive to promoting long-term and healthy development of friendly relations and cooperation between SCO member states , but also of great significance to safeguarding regional and world peace and stability .  
The ministers unanimously agree that the fruitful military cooperation based on that of the " Shanghai Five " has set an example for establishing new-type regional military cooperation commensurate with the trend of the times after the Cold War , which is not only conducive to promoting the long-term healthy development of the friendly and cooperative relations among the member nations of the " Shanghai Cooperation Organization " but also is of great significance to maintaining peace and stability in the region and even the world at large .  
As the situation of regional development has been changing and non-stop various international forces have been involved in the region , the unique ethnic , cultural conditions and the difficult regional security issues of the Eurasian area have been plaguing each country of the region .  
After the former Soviet Union collapsed , long existing potential regional problems , such as ethnic and religious issues , have become the real problems of the political and economic life in the newly independent Russia , and each Central Asian country in the region .  
The signing of the treaty not only will reflect the common desire of the two peoples for friendship from generation to generation , but also will show the development of friendly , comprehensive and mutually beneficial [ you hao quan mian hu li ] relations between China and Russia conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples , and is conducive to maintaining regional and world peace , stability and development .  
The Tibet party committees at all levels and the regional government must clearly recognize the situation , boost morale , seize upon opportunities , and forge ahead by taking advantage of the favorable situation .  They must continue to propagate self-reliance , arduous striving and the " old Tibetan spirit , " turn the support of the central government and every locality into a strong driving force , be open and progressive , and work creatively to make new contributions for the people of every nationality in Tibet .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin mentioned that it is necessary to uphold and perfect the system of people 's congress , the multiparty cooperation system under the leadership of the communist party , and the system of political consultation and regional national autonomy , actively , safely , and steadily push forward the reform of political structure , further expand the democracy of socialism , govern the country according to law , and build a socialist country ruled by law .  
This is a wise choice based on our national condition ; it has enabled us , when regional and world economic turbulence occur , to successfully guard against financial risks , avoid huge losses , and safeguard national economic security .  
She said : During the visit , President Jiang Zemin and President Putin will exchange views on a wide-range of current major and pressing regional and international issues , in order to make concerted efforts to safeguard global strategic balance and stability .  
Zanoun said : China 's righteous stance on international and regional affairs has been highly appreciated by the Arab states , including the Palestinian people .  China is the most reliable friend of the Arab people .  Palestine expects China to play an even greater role in halting the current bloody conflicts between Israel and Palestine and in bringing about an all-round , fair , and reasonable solution to the Middle East issue soon .  
In the face of the worst flood since the founding of New China , leading members of the Guangxi regional party committee and the regional government personally went to the front line to direct the work of combating the flood .  More than 100,000 military servicemen and people have been organized to reinforce the dikes .  After overcoming various kinds of difficulties , they built more than 10 kilometers of auxiliary dikes within two days .  
Diplomats of the two countries disclosed that Jiang Zemin and Putin will hold a summit meeting to exchange their views on the current international situation , major global and regional issues , including the US claim to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and its readiness to build the national missile defense system .  The two heads of state will reiterate their stands clarified during the " Shanghai Five " summit in June this year , namely , Putin stressed that Russia firmly safeguarded the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to prevent a new round of arms race ;  
In the field of regional issues , the two sides emphasized the adoption of active and effective measures to crack down on national splittist , international terrorist , religious extremist , and transnational criminal activities .  
Under the CPC 's leadership , cadres and common people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have abolished feudal serfdom and established political power based on the people 's democracy , and have been exercising regional ethnic autonomy and pressing ahead with the cause of building socialism .  All this has unleashed and expanded Tibet 's social productive forces to an unprecedented level and contributed to the continuing improvement of the Tibetan people 's material and cultural lives .  
It is necessary to keep to and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy , fully and correctly implement the party 's ethnic policy and religious policy , unite all forces that can be united , resolutely foil all separatist plans and sabotage attempts by a small number of separatists and the international hostile forces , and strive for a lasting peace and political stability in Tibet .  
Governments at all levels should have the resolve and should take strong measures against the illegal activities of manufacturing and selling counterfeit and shoddy goods , outlaw all places used for manufacturing and selling counterfeit goods , smash narrow-minded local protectionism and regional economic blockade , smash the monopoly of industries and trades , establish unified national markets , encourage enterprises to compete by fair means , and give shape to a market competition mechanism in real terms by which only the best will survive .  
The US believes that , in the aftermath of the Cold War , and particularly since entering the new century , there are still the following eight destabilizing factors in Asia : Border conflicts , religious contradictions , unstable domestic political situations , social and regional turmoil , territorial and sovereignty disputes , ethnic separatism , terrorist operations , and population problems .  
The Genoa meeting discussed many topics , but it mainly discussed global issues including reduction and exemption of poor countries ' debts , environmental protection , resolution and elimination of regional crises , and prevention and treatment of AIDS . However , the only accomplishment of this meeting would be its decision to establish a " global health fund . "  The fund intends to be fully operational within 2001 and aims to deal with AIDS , malaria , and TB , which are the three major contagious diseases threatening mankind .  
According to " New York Times , " the US Department of Defense recently decided to make a major adjustment in its military strategy , replacing the strategy of " fighting and winning two major wars simultaneously " implemented since 1991 with a new strategy requiring troops to " win a decisive victory " in a major regional war and , at the same time , maintain sufficient capability to fulfill other important tasks .  
Since coming to power , the Bush administration has stressed seeking " absolute security " for the US and attached importance to the " potential challenges " posed by regional powers .  Communist Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have on many occasions expressed concern in private about the Bush administration 's moves .  They are worried that this tough " Bushism " which is taking shape on the international scene would cast a shadow on the development of Sino-US relations .  
They also had an in-depth exchange of opinions on current major and urgent regional and international issues , thus reaching a broad consensus .  One of the most important results is that President Jiang and President Putin have signed the Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness , Friendship , and Cooperation . The treaty is permeated with peaceful thinking that the two countries will remain friends from generation to generation and never become enemies .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
Up to now , the navies of some middle class countries are equipped with light class carriers , with costs varying from $ 300-500-million , and while this class of carrier can fulfill some regional combat missions , they can not handle the naval formations of strong nations , so this class of carrier would have no practical significance for the Chinese navy .  
Raidi emphatically pointed out : Although the Western hostile forces have clung to their ambitious designs of splitting Tibet from China , and the task to fight against " Tibet independence " is still vary arduous , the autonomous regional government has confidence that it will overcome all obstacles , accelerate economic development and social progress in Tibet , and raise the people 's living standard .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .  
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
At 22:40 the same day , we drove to Hechi City where the regional leading group in charge of investigating incident was located .  We learned from the leading group 's principal leader that 72 people were confirmed dead in the incident .  
Taking the forthcoming four-country meeting of Chinese , Laotian , Myanmar , and Thai ministers on narcotics control as a turning point and acting according to the current mechanisms of international and regional anti-drug cooperation , we will continue to strengthen our cooperation with neighboring countries in narcotics control , prevent , crack down on , and bring under control narcotic and drug-related crimes , and strive to build sound and civilized public order and to eventually fulfill the long-term target of total prohibition of all narcotic drugs .  
In former years Japanese militarism launched wars of aggression against China , causing the Chinese people profound suffering , but for the sake of Asia-Pacific regional peace and stability , China has proposed the guideline of " take history as a mirror and look ahead " in its foreign relations with Japan , and has worked with Japan to build an enduringly stable , good neighborly , and friendly cooperative partnership .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
The Chinese military expert held that the 21st century would be a " marine century . "  He said : It is necessary to make conscientious efforts to build a powerful and large navy and turn it into one of the major forces that protect the motherland and safeguard world peace and regional security .  
Zhu Bangzao said : During his visits , Foreign Minister Tang will extensively exchange views with leaders of the four countries on further strengthening bilateral relations as well as on international and regional issues of common concern , to achieve the objective of enhancing mutual understanding , deepening friendship , widening consensus , and promoting cooperation .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
Zhu Bangzao said : The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on further strengthening diverse cooperative relations between China and the four countries in the political , economic , trade , and cultural fields , and on international and regional issues , such as the establishment of a new international political and economic order , the Middle East issue , the Gulf situation , and the Iraq issue .  They reached broad consensus .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
Sun Yuxi said : President Jiang 's upcoming visits will be an important diplomatic move made by China at the turn of the century .  The purpose of the visits are to step up high-level exchange between China and the aforementioned six countries , ensure further development of bilateral relations , and exchange views with them on the current international situation and the situations in regions of concern , in order to enhance mutual understanding and step up cooperation on international and regional affairs .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .  From the period when he was known as " Liuzhou tyrant " to the period when he served as a leader of the regional party committee and government , Liu sought illegal interests and made things convenient for his wife and children by abusing power .  He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
President Jiang 's current visits to the six countries is China 's important diplomatic action at the turn of the century aimed at strengthening high-level contacts between China and the above-mentioned six countries to further develop their bilateral ties and exchange views on the international and relevant regional situation .  The visits will increase their mutual understanding and enhance their cooperation in international and regional affairs .

Through this round of visits , China has strengthened high-level contacts with the nations concerned , promoted the further development of bilateral relations with them , enhanced mutual understanding with them , and strengthened cooperation with them in international and regional affairs .  
Therefore , the task of narrowing the development gap between the western and eastern regions to bring about regional economic and social revitalization and prosperity can not be accomplished with just one or two five-year plans or a 10-year program .  The task can only be eventually achieved through long-term and ceaseless efforts of many generations .  
Having built a batch of national-level and provincial-level professional seismic stations , regional remote forecast networks , seismic stations run by localities or enterprises , as well as monitoring points run by the masses , our country has established an earthquake monitoring system with Chinese characteristics , which integrates the efforts of professionals with those of the masses .  Our legal system building for the purpose of preventing earthquakes and reducing disasters has also made marked headway .  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .

In distributing the productive forces , designing the industrial structure and planning regional development , we should encourage the advanced , stress efficiency , give higher priority to selected projects as necessary , and let good examples spur on others .  We should also pay attention to structural balance and coordinated development , and to gradually narrowing the gap between different regions and between different trades so as to benefit national unity and social stability and eventually achieve common prosperity .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Albright also said that the months ahead will be very " substantial and busy " days in Sino-US relations .  She said : The US Senate will vote in early July on according China the permanent normal trade relations status ; I myself will meet Chinese foreign minister again in late July during the ASEAN regional forum period ; President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin will hold a meeting in September while they attend the UN millenium meeting of heads of state .  " Undoubtedly , development of Sino-US relations will speed up . "  
He stressed in particular : Law has entrusted to the various provincial ( regional , municipal ) governments the duty of ensuring the total area of farmland in their own administrative areas does not decrease .  This should be made an important index for assessing local party and government leaderships so that it will become a conscious action of leading cadres at all levels .  
At present the world situation is experiencing important and profound changes ; as two major developing countries , China and Iran are facing many common tasks and challenges , and share the same or similar views on many international and regional issues .  The Chinese side is willing to strive for new progress through joint efforts in the long-term and stable relationship of friendship and cooperation in the new century .

Whoever slackens the work of transformation through supervision and education should be held responsible for negligence .  
Since the founding their diplomatic relations almost 30 years ago , particularly over the last few years , the two countries ' relations have developed and they have conducted fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and educational fields as well as in international and regional affairs .  
The five governments all explicitly reiterated their willingness to adhere to the one China principle position and acknowledge that the PRC Government is the sole legal government that can represent China as a whole .

At today 's [ 9 March , 2001 ] news conference , when answering a reporter 's question on whether the regional security will be affected by the China 's increased budget for national defense expenditure this year , the Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao indicated : The persons using this to allege that the regional security will probably be threatened by China 's increased national defense spending utterly have an ulterior motive .  I am afraid they have other fish to fry .  
CPPCC National Committee Member Huang Guancong held that since China has a large territory with its different parts keeping their own special characteristics , it is necessary to scientifically study and reasonably plan out the program of construction of small cities and towns , based on scientific feasibility studies and in light of each locality 's regional and local strong points and weaknesses , resource availability , and population condition .  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
On the eve of the " two sessions , " the NPC Standing Committee approved the decision to amend the Regional National Autonomy Law , thus extensively overhauling the Regional National Autonomy Law adopted in 1984 .  In the original foreword , " regional national autonomy " was defined as " a major political system of the state . "  Now it is defined as " a basic political system of the state , " which fully expresses the nationality policy of the party and the government .  
Most of the latest amendments have to do with the economic system and demonstrate the support and aid of state organs at the higher levels for the autonomous regions .  They are designed to resolve a number of practical problems in economic and social development in minority autonomous areas and should help accelerate economic and social development in those areas and help promote national unity and perfect the regional national autonomy system . "  
Luo Gan said : The Chinese party and government have always attached great importance to developing good neighborliness , friendship , and all-round cooperation with Vietnam , regarding the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and two countries as not only the demand for invigorating the Chinese national economy and promoting reform and the socialist modernization drive , but also the demand for maintaining regional peace and the peace of the world at large and advancing the cause of human progress .  
The General Office of the Ministry of Education the other day issued a circular among various provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal education departments , in which it discussed an explosion incident , which broke out in a teaching building of a primary school in Jiangxi a week ago , and urged education departments in all areas as well as all types of schools at all levels to immediately take action to introduce a security and prevention system in schools so as to create favorable conditions for guaranteeing young people 's healthy growth .  
Only by conscientiously implementing the party 's policy towards minority nationalities and put into effect the regional national autonomy can the equal rights of different minority nationalities , as well as the right of autonomy in national autonomous areas , be fully protected ; can the enthusiasm of the people of different ethnic groups be fully aroused ; and can a common prosperity be brought true among different nationalities .  
Meanwhile , the province will also give prominence to the region 's key development areas , develop an economy that enjoys distinct regional characteristics , speed up the development of the Chengdu plain , carry out a comprehensive exploration of resources in the Panxi area , boost the construction and development of the areas in southern Sichuan , give more assistance to areas inhabited by minority nationalities , and extend vigorous support to the development of both hilly areas and the Penzhou mountain areas .

Guo Jinlong , secretary of the autonomous regional party committee , who is attending the current NPC session as a non-voting delegate , stated : The " two supremes " work reports have both placed in the front and the center work like cracking down on hostile forces or safeguarding reunification of the motherland , and this fully conforms with Tibet 's realities and gives us tremendous encouragement and support , for Tibet is in the forefront of the struggle against separatism .  
In addition , it is imperative to keep to and make perfect the regional autonomous system for ethnic minorities so as to develop the socialist relations among different ethnic groups marked by equality , unity , and mutual assistance and enable them to achieve common prosperity and progress .  
Picula gave a briefing on the latest development of the regional situation in southeast Europe where Croatia is located , said Croatia is deeply disturbed by the armed conflicts that have broken out recently in Kosovo and Macedonia , and hoped the existing problems will be solved politically through a peaceful approach .  
the WTO requires various member countries , whether large or small , to implement the principle of nondiscriminating trade treatment ; a legal system and good market order are a regular way to attract international investment , especially investment from transnational corporations , and the practice of relying on preferential policies and special regional treatment to attracting foreign investment will be no longer effective ;  
However , there exist in varying degrees trade monopoly , regional blockade , coercive trade , discriminative treatment , and other problems , which have cut the market apart , restricted fair competition , and disrupted market order as well .  
" Because of Hong Kong 's excellent infrastructure , robust financial market and its role as an international business hub , " said Mr Ho , " many overseas investors who wish to enter the Chinese market often finds it desirable to have a Hong Kong partner or to set up a regional office in Hong Kong .

" By bringing together companies from other economies , researchers in our tertiary institutions and local enterprises with scientific and technological competence , the science park will provide a major impetus for the development of indigenous science and technology-based companies in Hong Kong , " he said , adding that it would also promote technology transfer by attracting overseas investment and enhance regional co-operation in this area .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
" The rule of law continues to prevail and is being upheld ; people continues to enjoy the freedoms and rights they enjoyed in the past ; there has been no erosion of human rights ; public debates remain lively and demonstrations continue to be a natural part of everyday life ; the press continues to operate openly and freely ; the civil service is the same as it was , and the co - operation with the global and regional partners continues to develop and strengthen . "  
We held an Environmental Awareness Seminar for our senior staff in the City Hall in October 1997 , enlisting assistance from external expert key speakers .

I am confident that , with our strong fundamentals , coupled with our flexibility of adaptation to external shock , and with the extent of price and cost adjustment that our free market economy has allowed us to go through up to now , our economy should be able to rebound expeditiously from the current doldrums , once the regional situation has settled , and our outlook beyond that remains bright . 
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the sharp decline in retail sales in May 1998 reflected the further weakening in consumer sentiment upon renewed regional instability during the month .  May was marked by the occurrence of some negative events with particularly wide repercussions for the region including Hong Kong .  
In short , our commitment to an open and free market and to the linked exchange rate system is paramount .  We will be vigilant in safeguarding them .  And we will make sure they will continue to work well to the benefit of the public and all local and overseas investors even when external economic conditions are turbulent .  It is our duty to the local community and to the stability of the regional markets .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
Speaking after a ' warm and cordial ' bilateral meeting with Singapore 's Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong , the Chief Executive said he valued constant dialogue to reinforce ties between Hong Kong and Singapore . " We attach great importance to close co-operation with all our regional partners in trade and economic matters , " said Mr Tung , who is in Malaysia for the annual APEC Economic Leaders Meetings tomorrow ( Tuesday ) and Wednesday . 
The dialogue on the financial crisis covered several topics , which included the strengthening of financial and legal systems , recapitalising banks affected by bad debts , the use of savings to build domestic bond and securities markets and ways to guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
The spokesman explained that the distinct narrowing in the visible trade deficit in 1998 reflected the adjustment in domestic demand upon the impact of the regional financial turmoil , which led to a marked decline in imports retained for local use .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
A stable and efficient debt market provides an effective avenue for Governments and enterprises to raise capital .  It is critical to the steady development of the financial industries as well as to the overall stability of the regional economies .  
For applications of similar quality that meet the above conditions , Mr Kwong said the following factor would be considered favourably : potential tenants in the information services sector which bring to Hong Kong their head office or regional headquarters , the level of investment per square metre over the first five years of tenancy , and the percentage of head-count in the Cyberport employing professional and technical staff .  
The existing 60 VIRs , all of which have become operational , are located at different bureaux , regional crime units and most major divisional stations for interviewing persons involved in cases which are likely to be heard in the District Court or the Court of First Instance .

Mr Yam identified the areas to be considered for the building of a stronger financial system as : prudent management of the international financial architecture , international reform in financial disclosure and regulation , and regional monetary co-operation .  
In that short period , many crucial legal issues have been addressed .  These include the status of the Provisional Legislative Council , the adaptation of laws programme , the criminal jurisdiction of Mainland courts over cross-boundary activities , the right of abode issue , and the constitutionality of laws protecting the national and regional flags .  
As the local and regional economic environment stabilised , Hong Kong recorded a further BoP surplus amounting to $ 1.9 billion , equivalent to 0.6% of GDP , in the second quarter of 1999 .  
As Hong Kong 's exports improved along with the regional economic recovery and as the slack domestic demand continued to hold back imports retained for local use , the visible trade deficit narrowed further , from $ 8.8 billion in the first quarter of 1999 to $ 7.4 billion in the second quarter .  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
In federations , such as the United States of America , Australia and Canada , legislative power is divided between the central and regional governments .  Almost invariably , the central government is empowered to legislate on a wide range of subject matters , and the powers of regional governments are restricted .  
This was the combined result of the strong rebound in Hong Kong 's exports of goods upon the improved regional and global economic environment and the slack in retained imports reflecting the modest domestic demand for most of the year .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
" I believe that a deep and liquid regional market is one way that we can help alleviate the risks of sudden , erratic and sometimes huge international capital flows into and out of specific markets .  
While earnings from Hong Kong 's direct investment abroad continued to rise markedly upon the sustained regional recovery , there was additional investment income from acquisition of overseas enterprises by some multinational enterprise groups during the period . 
Exports of services also surged on the back of the robust regional demand , yielding a substantial invisible trade surplus of $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , considerably enlarged from that of $ 14.8 billion in the same quarter in 1999 .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 66.7 billion and $ 65.3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 over the preceding quarter , reflecting the much improved regional and local investment situation upon the economic revival .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .  
Within the total factor income inflow , direct investment income ( DII ) recorded a substantial increase of 26.9% in the second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier , reflecting that the earnings from Hong Kong 's direct investment abroad continued to rise markedly upon the sustained regional recovery . 
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 78.5 billion and $ 137.1 billion during the second quarter of 2000 , reflecting the improved regional and local investment environment upon the economic revival .  
Within the total factor income inflow , direct investment income ( DII ) increased by 10.7% in the third quarter of 2000 over a year earlier , reflecting the continued improvement in investment returns from abroad upon the regional economic recovery . 
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased , by $ 34.4 billion and $ 56.3 billion respectively during the third quarter of 2000 , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
While conceding that there may not be a single quick fix strategy to turn Hong Kong into a regional innovation and technology hub , Mr Ho was confident that the Government 's continued commitment , coupled with a focused approach and pragmatic programmes to lay a sound foundation , would help Hong Kong develop towards this end .  
Hong Kong is developing into a major regional hub of electronic commerce , with liberalized and well-established telecommunications infrastructure , a culture embracing information technology and new innovations , close relationship with the Mainland , and successful cooperation between the public and private sector in driving infrastructural and technological developments .  
What is particularly encouraging is that between 1999 and 2000 , the number of regional headquarters and offices established by multinational corporations in Hong Kong increased from 2,500 to 3,000 ; Hong Kong is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Asia after Mainland China , amounting to US $ 23.1 billion last year .  
( c ) The HKPC is to fulfil its public mission to promote the productivity of industry in Hong Kong through providing low-return supporting services which see a lack of participation by the private sector , conducting market development research and organising promotional activities for various trades , providing services to small and medium enterprises , and liaising with relevant regional and international organisations .  The Government , therefore , has no plan to change the funding arrangements for the HKPC to make it operate on a self-financing basis .  
Invest Hong Kong , the government body charged with attracting foreign investment to Hong Kong , is targeting major corporations and leading businesses that are considering expanding into Asia . Helping them spread the message that Hong Kong is where they should base their regional operations is " Spirit of Hong Kong " , the 72-foot yacht taking part in the grueling BT Global Challenge race . 
Both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased markedly in 2000 , by $ 491.1 billion and $ 502.1 billion respectively , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
Meanwhile , they are deepening regional economic and technical cooperation , with emphasis on scientific and technological exchanges , human resources development and infrastructure construction .  They are working for a sound development of a multilateral trade regime so that they may complement one another .  
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .  China has given prominence to the development of science , technology and education , accelerated the informatization of national economic and social progress , strengthened environmental protection , expedited township development and improved public service system .  
At the annual meeting , member jurisdictions discussed a wide range of issues , including economic implications of money laundering , global anti-money laundering initiatives and the regional response , APG mutual evaluations , and current and future typologies work on money laundering methods .  
The annual meeting was attended by over 200 senior officials from central banks , financial regulatory bodies , and legal , financial and law enforcement agencies of member and observer jurisdictions , as well as representatives from international and regional organisations , including the Asian Development Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the United Nations and the World Customs Organization .  
" Our strengths in financial services and professional skills - management , accounting , legal services , consulting , marketing and international sourcing , couple with our excellent air , sea and telecommunications infrastructure , underline our role as a leading regional and international hub as the world goes to China , the mother of all emerging markets in the 21st century , " he added .  
Some 3 000 overseas companies have established their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong . Two years ago we attracted the second highest amount of external direct investment in Asia , just behind the Mainland and far exceeding other places in Asia . That figure increased more than 1.5 times last year .  China 's accession to the World Trade Organisation is expected to add impetus to this momentum .  
" As stated by the Chief Executive in his Policy Address this year , the Government is fully committed to providing a conducive environment and the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the development and promotion of Hong Kong as the preferred international and regional transportation and logistics hub , as well as a base for coordinating and integrating service providers for the global and regional demand and supply chain , " Mr Leung added .  
Its good legal , exchange rate , taxation and regulatory environments , coupled with its excellent professional services , have made it especially well suited for regional headquarters and regional offices .  In addition , Hong Kong will remain firm in its position as a financial centre .  
Looking ahead , we will further develop the depth and width of our bond market .  We are forging the bilateral linkage with Euroclear with a view to promoting cross-boundary custody and clearing of Hong Kong and overseas bonds , and at the same time expanding the base of investors , thereby stimulating the growth of both local and regional bond markets .  We will also develop our CMU into an international clearing house , so that Hong Kong will become the central clearing house in Asia . This will strengthen our status as an international financial centre .  
The Home Affairs Bureau and Leisure and Cultural Services Department have commissioned a consultancy firm in mid November 2001 to conduct a study on the Provision of Regional / District Cultural and Performance Facilities in Hong Kong ( the Study ) , which aims to identify the community 's long-term needs and to rationalize the provision of existing cultural and performance facilities at the regional / district level to facilitate future planning . 
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis . They were ( i ) fiscal policy in good and bad times ; ( ii ) financial systems and corporate governance ; ( iii ) exchange rate systems ; and ( iv ) potential regional economic arrangements for Asia .  
CNBC , the foremost global provider of business and financial information and TNT , the world 's leading business logistics solutions company , today ( May 23 ) announced the launch of the Asia Business Leader Awards 2002 , the prestigious annual honour that recognises achievement , innovation and leadership in regional business .  
While core infrastructure projects completed in the last five years have enhanced the competitive edge of Hong Kong as a major regional business and transportation hub , the HKSAR Government 's commitment to invest C $ 120 billion in future infrastructure developments will ensure that Hong Kong will continue to be a world-class business city with a pleasant living environment for its citizens and visitors . 
China 's WTO accession has accentuated the problems of non-competitive SOE 's , including large portfolios of non-performing loans ; mounting public debt ; a sizable pension deficit ; regional polarities with rising unemployment and labour redundancies ; continued efforts in strengthening a law-based business environment with a higher level of consistency and corporate governance ; the demand for more investment capital ; and the need for more training and re-training in the skills and expertise for international businesses . 
Members of the audience were fascinated by the stylish performance that featured bold and energetic art style of the northern land .  Heilongjiang Province Song and Dance Theatre is a well-established provincial-level performing group .  Since its establishment in 1954 , the Theatre has produced and performed folk music and dance programmes with rich regional flavour , and has won the national Wenhua Award .

The two Governments have agreed to consider in detail the enhanced control measures recommended in the report of a joint study on regional air quality completed earlier this year and , having regard to their feasibility , implement a series of additional measures with the objective of achieving the agreed emission reduction targets by 2010 .  
The favourable ratings given to the five most important factors - low and simple tax system ; political stability and security ; free flow of information ; rule of law and independent judiciary ; and corruption-free government - point to why Hong Kong remains the preferred location for regional operations in this region .  
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .  
We will step up efforts to promote the economic potential of Hong Kong and the PRD . We will actively open up new markets , bringing in more foreign capital , attracting foreign talent , and encouraging more multinational corporations to set up their regional headquarters in Hong Kong .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
The company is the world 's largest specialized provider of discount hotel accommodations .  The Managing Director ( Asia Pacific ) of Hotels.com , Mr Bill Edward , said today ( March 10 ) : " The free and business-friendly economy , the ideal geographical location with easy access to China and the skilled workforce were also crucial to locating our regional headquarters here . "  
The Government also monitors the local pump prices of unleaded petrol and ultra low sulphur diesel against monthly average Singapore FOB prices ( the generally accepted regional benchmark for pricing in the Asia Pacific Region ) .  
For instance , to optimise the use of resources , the Immigration Department proposed a reorganisation of its regional offices , including closure of certain less cost-effective marriage registries and births and deaths registries .  This required the Government to amend the relevant subsidiary legislation and to consult those in the community affected by the closures to work out suitable arrangements so that the remaining offices could meet public demand for the services concerned .  
With such result and not least the tremendous effect by a very competent local staff , there is no doubt we took the right decision to set up our regional base in Hong Kong and we will continue to expand here in the coming future . " 
" With excellent business infrastructure , a highly qualified workforce , free flow of goods , capital and information and a transparent regulatory system , Hong Kong is an ideal location for retailers to establish their regional operations .  
" As the world 's freest economy and a vibrant and sophisticated international financial and business centre , Hong Kong 's strategic location and international networks , as well as experience and expertise in dealing with foreign and China business make us the preferred destination for international companies to set up their regional offices and regional headquarters . "  
Apart from partnerships with local stakeholders , the annual report gives an account of cooperation with regional and international organisations on protecting the environment .  It also looks ahead to major tasks in different aspects of the environment in the coming years .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
As a matter of fact , Hong Kong 's excellent business environment , simple and low tax regime , cosmopolitan lifestyle , superb geographical location , free economy , rule of law , skilled workforce with international vision , world class infrastructure as well as efficient and clean government are factors attracting many overseas multi-national corporations to set up their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong .  
About half a year ago , the National Science Council established a Taipei regional analytical instrument center and purchased a single crystal diffractometer for the measurement of molecular structure .  
The participants were organized into panels to discuss the following eight topics : tactics for long-term economic development , the development of education and human resources , social and cultural development , the development of science and technology , the development of capital and currency markets , regional development , planning for a comprehensive transportation system , and information and communications .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
Chou Mi-mi director of the Revival Youth Yueh Drama Troupe , explains that the performance style of Yueh drama incorporates the best elements of Peking opera , spoken drama and folk opera . With attractive melodies and an easy to understand vernacular text , it is ideal for people of all ages and well worth preserving as a valuable example of regional opera . " I hope that the government will do more to extend a helping hand to traditional folk opera and so keep its legacy alive , " says enthusiastic proponent Chou Mi-mi . (  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
Computerized bloodhoundFrom the midst of the current dispute , in which citizens claim to be laden with extra burdens and the medical community decries a drop in the standards of payment , a new problem is beginning to emerge - - how to ensure that insurance premiums are paid . In particular , the more than 980,000 unemployed and self-employed who have registered for insurance under the miscellaneous " regional population " category will be far less easily accounted for .  
Furthermore , comic dialogue by its very nature demands close attention to oration ( of poems , tongue twisters and jokes ) , imitation ( of various regional dialects , insect noises and bird calls ) and singing ( folk ballads , regional operas , and even pop songs ) , all bound up in a comical style .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
The US plays the leading role under the newly issued Guidelines , while Japan will support the US in any military conflict around Japan . When there is a crisis involving a " regional " issue , the US is required to take responsibility for restoring peace and security in the " region . " Japan , meanwhile , is obliged to keep open its base facilities , airfields , and ports , and provide support to US forces in operating in international waters and airspace .  
But in regard to this question , the international community wants the cross-strait problem to be resolved peacefully .

Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .

The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .

The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
Furthermore , Member States ' willingness to assume the onerous responsibilities inherent in permanent membership of the Security Council , and thereby bolster its capacity to fulfil its mandate , should have been convincingly demonstrated by their contributions to the promotion of regional peace and global security through successful diplomatic initiatives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts , as well as by participation in peace-keeping operations over a period of time .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in international political and economic life , such as Germany and Japan , as well as other influential countries in regional or global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council .  
The end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that the United Nations , freed from nuclear and ideological confrontation , would devote its full attention to building a peaceful and more equitable world ; tackle the challenge of world poverty ; advance regional conflicts to resolution ; distribute the benefits of peace dividends ; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized premises of the Charter , especially with regard to collective security .

This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
This policy affirms the principles of regional cooperation and strengthens the concept of good neighbourliness , mutual respect and commitment to the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter and lay the foundations for mutual understanding based on commitment to the values of continuous exchanges of joint vital interests .  
In order to boost such development and lasting stability , there is an urgent need for concerted efforts by the international organizations and specialized agencies within the United Nations system , coupled with broader and more intensive cooperation at a regional level .  
We have drawn this issue to the attention of the Security Council , and we are confident that as a result urgent action at the national , regional and international levels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization and cooperation in the judicial , police and even intelligence spheres , in order to halt this insidious manifestation of terror .

Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .

In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
We must therefore , in our collective commitment to achieve security at the international as well as at the regional level , ensure that our efforts are comprehensive in addressing every member of the international community and that the obligations prescribed will be balanced and equitable for all .  
The Organization of American States , for example , stated on 13 September that nuclear tests being carried out in the South Pacific pose a potential risk to the health and security of surrounding States and their living resources and environment , and do not take into account the precautionary principle contained in the Rio Declaration on environment and development and in other regional agreements .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
While tensions that have arisen in historic moments , happily behind us , have given us a world more free and open to achieving the ultimate objectives of the Charter to practice tolerance and peaceful coexistence , maintain international peace and security and save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today 's peace is still a peace of little wars , local and regional conflicts fanned by drastic differences of an ethnic , economic or religious nature .  
We are , in effect , seeing the steady growth of a series of complementary regional arrangements perhaps becoming even hemispheric in effect for the southern half of the globe which underpin the international non-proliferation regime and give it a distinctive regional commitment .

Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Similarly , my delegation feels it necessary to point out that security in the Latin American region is also closely linked to the process of economic and social development and , hence , the need for integral plans for regional security which spell out the social , economic , humanitarian and environmental aspects alongside the military issues . 
The pan-national unified State to be established in accordance with the proposal for reunification through confederation will form a confederated government in which the two regional autonomous governments of the north and south of Korea participate on an equal footing , and will be an independent , peaceful , non-aligned and neutral State that does not depend on any other big Power .  
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it .

Mr . William Seltzer , former Director of the Statistical Division , delivered a commemorative address covering some of the primary issues considered in establishing the Statistical Commission in 1946 , the range of issues that the Commission has addressed over the years , and patterns that have emerged in the work of the Commission and of the international statistical organizations over the past 50 years , including patterns in substance , regional focus and principal matters of concern .  
The primary objective of this programme area is to provide assessments of the current status and trends in major developmental and environmental issues at the national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards :

Also believe that the current mandate leaves substantial room for a more assertive and effective mission by UNPROFOR and relevant regional organizations , especially bearing in mind Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , although there could be potential enhancement of the existing Security Council mandate of UNPROFOR ;  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
Encourage major groups working in the population / gender field and in other sustainable development fields to increase their communication , cooperation and coordination at the local , regional and international levels in order to reinforce their contribution to the mutual understanding of these issues and to facilitate their active participation in the implementation of chapter 5 of Agenda 21 and chapter III of the Programme of Action ;  
Under the heading " strengthening support for families " , proposed actions would be arranged according to the principal actors concerned : national Governments ; regional or local governments ; the private sector ; non-governmental organizations at different levels ; research and academic institutions ; the media .

The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , should enhance the relevance of vocational and technical training to both current and prospective employment conditions by applying a broad and flexible approach to human resources development for youth that fosters the capacity of skilled labour to adjust to changes in labour demand .  
We hope that Iraq will soon be in a position to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , so that there will be no need for this mechanism and so that Iraq may resume its regional and international role in the peaceful and positive manner that would enable the brotherly people of Iraq to overcome the years of hardship and to make up for their losses in the domain of economic and social development .  
Provision of technical advisory services upon request to Member States on satellite communications , remote sensing , basic space science and satellite meteorology and environmental monitoring to support national and regional programmes and projects in such fields ;  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
Urges the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in cooperation with the regional and other organizations where appropriate , to submit to their governing and legislative organs concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant United Nations decisions , particularly specific programmes of assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories and their national liberation movements ;

It urges Governments and major groups , as well as relevant international organizations and the scientific community , to participate actively in strengthening Earthwatch as an international partnership to ensure an adequate flow of information on the global and regional environment , to support decision-making and to give early warning on the state of the environment .  
Special attention is drawn to the need for improved delivery of information to decision makers and to increased participation in environmental observations at the local and national levels within regional and international frameworks .  
The Commission noted the importance of developing , among the organizations of the United Nations system , a common or compatible system of access to their respective databases , in order to share data fully , to streamline the collection and interpretation of data and to identify data gaps , for the purpose of providing more comprehensive and integrated data to decision makers at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .

( i ) Statistical profiles by subregion ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) regional compendium of environmental statistics ; ( iii ) statistical charts on thematic topics ( 2 ) ; and ( iv ) technical publications on socio-economic and environment statistics ( 2 ) ; 
Adjustments in this direction have involved increasing popular participation , promoting peaceful inter-State relations and enhancing regional security and stability , increasing the participation of enterprises and cooperation among them and their associations , expanding cooperation with major external partners , including in some instances through the formation of preferential trading agreements , and restructuring the policy organs and executive secretariats of groupings .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
Among the multilateral organizations , the World Bank , which had previously paid limited attention to regional integration , has in the recent past been adopting an unambiguous supportive role , as manifested in several of its activities in Africa in particular , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) has made support for regional economic cooperation a central feature of its programming cycles .  
The main rationale for the implementation of the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community was that major prerequisites , including social stability , sustained economic development and social progress , could not be achieved by individual countries in isolation .  Major obstacles to regional cooperation and integration are the paucity or lack of financial resources to support the process .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .

That community must reaffirm that the human rights of women form an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and that the full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international level , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex , are priority objectives of the international community .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms . 
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .  
The Committee was also informed that the distribution of resources had been guided by the priority areas as identified in the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised , 2 / and also by those reflected in the budget outline , namely , political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal oversight .  
Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
The continuing political impasse in the Liberian peace process is a sign of a dangerous trend , also manifested in the Liberian parties ' disregard of the numerous appeals issued by the international community and by African regional organizations , in particular the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , and of the vigorous efforts aimed at the speedy achievement of a political settlement in that country .  
The representative of ECLAC stated that at present , INSTRAW was experiencing a turning point , therefore its cooperation with the regional commissions required some analysis so that INSTRAW could significantly contribute to the regional work that was taking place ; by the same token , the regional commissions could provide support to INSTRAW 's activities , based on their knowledge of their specific regional conditions , and the regional institutions dealing with the relevant subjects .  
Particular areas in which regional cooperation requires strengthening by both the Territories concerned and international agencies : preservation and protection of marine and other natural resources from over-exploitation ; transport and communications ; higher education ; research and development ; regional pooling arrangements for sharing special skills and expertise ; and assistance in the public health area ;

Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
A regional model is a coordinated set of activities in the mental health field in a certain geographic area , each programme consists of training in post traumatic therapy and in assisting victims of sexual violence .  
Major changes have included strengthening the overarching theoretical framework to identify and refine its major human resource development components more clearly , a narrowing of focus to key practical and high-priority activities , and updating implementing arrangements to reflect changing regional circumstances .  
A regional project in southern Africa is providing training to managers and field workers in interpersonal communication skills and the use of low-cost audiovisual materials .  Rural radio remains the most effective mass medium to reach large numbers of rural audiences and FAO is continuing its efforts to strengthen rural radio services , especially in Africa .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
The United Nations system can support these regional efforts , both by improving linkages , in terms of direct relevance , down to country strategies , as well as providing global communication of the commonalities and differences across regions , thus providing useful contextual and comparative information to those charged with human resource development planning .  
The Fifth Summit will chart ASEAN 's future direction towards intensifying political , economic and functional cooperation to make ASEAN an even more cohesive and dynamic regional grouping .  
In the meantime , in order to address the urgent problems facing the repatriation of refugees , it may be useful to convene , at the earliest possible date , a regional meeting aimed at developing concrete measures to implement the commitments embodied in the Nairobi Summit declaration of January 1995 , the Bujumbura Action Plan of February 1995 and the tripartite agreements signed by UNHCR , Rwanda and neighbouring countries hosting Rwandan refugees .

The Commission urged all members and associate members to take prompt action to establish national coordinating mechanisms for the Year , and requested the Executive Secretary of the Commission to undertake several specific measures , including the convening of a regional intergovernmental preparatory meeting and the initiation of a series of country studies on the role of the family in development .  
The meeting reviewed the global observances of the Year and their implications for national social policies in the process of sustainable development ; considered concepts and forms of international cooperation on family issues , with particular emphasis on assistance to developing countries ; and identified strategies and recommendations regarding national , regional and international follow-up to the Year .  
A wide array of activities was undertaken at the regional level , including four regional preparatory meetings , with the objective of supporting and supplementing national and local efforts .  
To that end , the Ministers emphasized the need for concerted action in the region against the spread of extremism , which exploited the noble and sacred values of their peoples , and against arms proliferation and drug trafficking , and for swift implementation of the measures to combat those problems adopted at the meeting on regional security held at Bamako on 22 and 23 August 1994 .  16 .  The Ministers noted with concern the difficult economic situation in their countries .  
To this end , we shall establish , based on the successful public / private sector Caribbean Coalition on Tourism Marketing Programme for North America , broad-based regional marketing programmes and joint representation in the major markets , including the intra-Caribbean market , on a sustainable basis , and develop , not later than the end of 1995 , a financing arrangement to sustain this initiative .

A peaceful solution to the present acute and extremely dangerous crisis - one that would end up in a stable regional order , equality of States and good neighbourliness in the region - requires the active engagement of the most responsible international forums , especially the Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General .  
My delegation is confident that a termination of the brutal hostilities and human carnage that Rwanda has endured for a good part of this century can most effectively be pursued through political means that emphasize peaceful solutions while being cognizant of the regional dimensions of the issues that confront Rwanda and impact its internal and external security .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and , where agreed , to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement , logbook data on catch and effort , including data on fishing operations on the high seas , at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
The ASEAN Population Programme covers training for population control , development of population information networks and studies on relevant issues ; the women 's programme addresses common problems such as illiteracy , lack of technical skills , poor nutrition and ill health , and strenuous workload especially among rural women .  SADC has established a culture and information sector whose main objective is to ensure the people 's involvement in the process of regional integration and development .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
The activities executed at the regional level by the UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific ( PROAP ) at Bangkok serve 40 member States . 4 / The national commissions of UNESCO in the member States themselves form a network of cooperation which is further supported by a number of networks of specialized educational institutions and several thousand key educators in Asia and the Pacific participating in South-South cooperation through a number of mechanisms .

At the regional and international levels , mechanisms and institutions to promote the advancement of women as an integral part of mainstream political , economic , social and cultural development , and of initiatives on development and human rights , encounter similar problems emanating from a lack of commitment at the highest levels .  
Include information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected ;  
Implementation is primarily the responsibility of Governments , but is also dependent on a wide range of institutions in the public , private and non-governmental sectors at the community , national , subregional / regional and international levels . specifically devoted to women 's advancement globally . 
Implementation of the Platform for Action by national , subregional / regional and international institutions , both public and private , would be facilitated by transparency , by increased linkages between networks and organizations and by a consistent flow of information among all concerned .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
At the same time , operational activities are to be expanded significantly and a solid base for technical cooperation and assistance established , to strengthen the programme 's role as a service provider , as well as an honest broker in putting prospective donors and clients in touch , promoting international exchanges , coordinating regional and interregional action , etc .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
For example , the Vienna Convention has given rise to a wave of legislative activity at the national level , supported by the legal assistance programme of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , as well as to the adoption of numerous bilateral and regional agreements that implement and further the Convention 's provisions .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .

ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
The mass media must also be mobilized with the support of non-governmental organizations , at the level of both States and regional organizations , in order to ensure the periodic dissemination of human rights information .  In addition , greater efforts must be made by the mass media to avoid propagating racist prejudice and stereotypes and to help the general public to form responsible critical opinions on the increasingly tragic events which tend to be trivialized in some circles .  
The Forum believed this statement sets out clear visionary but achievable goals , based on its members ' many shared interests and building on the Forum 's tradition of close regional consultation , which would significantly strengthen the region 's capacity to adapt to a rapidly changing international and regional environment .

ODA is one such international opportunity , and for many countries , it is a crucial one .  But with generally weakening oil prices and regional wars , the average saving rate of these countries fell from almost 65 per cent of GDP in the mid-1970s to less than 25 per cent by the late 1980s ( see United Nations , World Economic Survey , 1992 ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Department staff held meetings with the senior representatives of the League to discuss joint actions to organize a regional seminar on a new integrated approach for sustainable human development : spatial / sectoral development strategy for Arab countries .  
NULLWithin the framework of the ILO / ALO joint programme agreed upon at the beginning of 1994 , five Arab regional seminars / expert group meetings were organized on the following topics : employment and labour market policies ; small enterprises development ( for employers ' organizations ) ; employment and labour market programmes in the context of sustainable human development ; and Arab and international labour standards .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
In resolution 49 / 21 I , the General Assembly emphasized the necessity of designing a new programme for international cooperation with Central America , based on the principles established in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of CIREFCA , at a meeting held in Mexico City in June 1994 , and the regional strategy contained within the Alliance for Sustainable Development .  
NULLThe themes should be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue : to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
However , if regional integration is accompanied by discriminatory barriers , visible or invisible , to goods and services from the outside world , such arrangements can undermine the open and multilateral character of the international trading system , and lead to fragmentation and potential trade and economic frictions among trading blocs .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
Technical institutions and other forms of professional interest groups have a valuable role to play , particularly at the regional level , in articulating commonly held concerns or requirements of countries that are exposed to similar types of hazards or share common geographical or cultural attributes .  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
The study will draw on a wide range of practices and experiences at all levels , which will be combined in a comprehensive appraisal of the needs of children , leading in turn to specific recommendations for action directed to the national , regional and international communities to enable them to respond more effectively to those needs .  
Starting as a small programme implemented jointly with UNEP to assist countries to implement the prior informed consent ( PIC ) procedure for chemicals in international trade , these programmes now increasingly address a wider spectrum of chemicals management topics , relevant to sound industrial development at both national and regional levels .

The goal of sustainable development would best be met by an approach that considered the interests of all members of the international community .  
Australia was a founding member of the International Coral Reef Initiative whose aims included promoting education programmes , improved coastal management and coordinated research and monitoring at the global , regional and national levels to ensure that coral reef resources were managed in a sustainable fashion .  
Forum countries had increased their active participation in recent international and regional forums , in which they had emphasized the importance of maintaining sound environmental management practices and sustainable development .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Realizing the urgent need to resolve underlying conflicts , to diminish tensions and to accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control with a view to maintaining regional and international peace and security in a world free from the scourge of war and the burden of armaments ,  
The full and equal participation of women in political , civil , economic , social and cultural life , at the national , regional and international levels , and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
Taking into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
Increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially by , inter alia , formulating or strengthening and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , international , subregional , regional and international levels ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
At a time when tremendous efforts were being made at the regional and subregional levels to overcome the problems with which the continent was faced , the role of the United Nations should be enhanced , particularly in the fields of social and economic development , rather than limited to humanitarian assistance .  
The Charter of the United Nations devoted an entire chapter ( Chapter VIII ) to regional arrangements or agencies in which it set forth the basic principles governing their activities and established the legal framework for cooperation between regional agencies or arrangements and the United Nations in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Realizing the urgent need to resolve underlying conflicts , to diminish tensions and to accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control with a view to maintaining regional and international peace and security in a world free from the scourge of war and the burden of armaments ,  
His delegation was happy to note that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , having identified the weaknesses in the Global Programme of Action aimed at combating drugs , had , during 1995 , adopted resolutions intended to create a cohesive strategy in that domain , enhance regional and international cooperation , particularly between customs authorities , and prevent the diversion of psychotropic substances for illicit purposes .  
convinced that the appointment of a Director to head each of the three regional centres was essential to ensure the continued effective functioning of the centres , the General Assembly , in the same resolution , requested the Secretary-General to establish , as soon as practicable , the post of Director at each of the regional centres .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of all States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , the universal nature of which is beyond question .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
into consideration the will of the Central American presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for Sustainable Development " 4 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a re-defining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,

On 11 December 1990 , in its resolution 45 / 72 , the General Assembly endorsed the Committee 's recommendation that " the United Nations should lead , with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations , an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national / regional educational institutions in the developing countries " .  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular , the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes with a time-frame for the period 1996-1997 ;  
also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially by , inter alia , formulating or strengthening and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , international , subregional , regional and international levels ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;

all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
therefore welcomed the opportunity provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to determine how best to make use of the changes at the international level with a view to enhancing respect for the generally accepted norms and principles of international law , for which purpose collective and sustained efforts towards the development and codification of the law in the areas of disarmament , the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts , the protection of human rights and the promotion of development would be required .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments , international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
MEKDAD ( Syrian Arab Republic ) said that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action had stated that all human rights were universal , interdependent and interconnected and that the international community should deal with human rights in a comprehensive , equitable and even-handed manner , while taking regional and cultural specificities into consideration .  
he said that States were currently faced with a choice : to be part of a harmonious international system whose regional and international efforts were based on human morality , or to remain indifferent to sedition , ethnic cleansing and ideological hostility .  NULL AMOR ( Tunisia ) reaffirmed Tunisia 's commitment to provide all necessary assistance to United Nations refugee-related activities .  
PHAM ( Viet Nam ) said that Viet Nam had not been immune to the overwhelming refugee crisis which had affected the entire world and had worsened in recent years as a result of poverty , regional or internal armed conflicts , political , economic and social crises , violence and intolerance .  
Supreme Council took note of the steps taken for the implementation of its decision at its fifteenth session concerning the development of economic cooperation within the framework of implementation of the Economic Agreement and approved the recommendations of the Committee on Financial and Economic Cooperation concerning the development of banking in Council States and increasing its competitivity at the regional and international levels , which would , in principle , permit national banks to open branches in Council States and effect a linkage between national automated banking networks in Council States . 
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and , in that regard , to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Robaina Gonz \ x { 5aee } ez ( Cuba ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Government of Cuba has requested the resumption of this session of the General Assembly in order to provide information regarding the events surrounding the repeated violation of our sovereignty by aircraft originating from United States territory , and also to give notice to the international community and to world public opinion that such violations are inadmissible and have dangerous implications for regional peace and security .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
By its resolution 43 / 75 I of 7 December 1988 , the General Assembly expressed its conviction that arms transfers in all their aspects deserve serious consideration by the international community , inter alia , because of : ( a ) their potential effects in areas where tension and regional conflict threaten international peace and security and national security ; ( b ) their known and potential negative effects on the process of the peaceful social and economic development of all peoples ; and ( c ) increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking .  
In our view , it is high time to concentrate the efforts of United Nations Member States on the formation of a legal basis which would allow us to implement this important initiative as one of the steps towards increasing the level of international economic security , securing the global coordination of the activities of international , regional and national economic institutions and preventing economic coercion and discrimination .  
Despite the end of the cold war , regional , religious and ethnic disputes are being further aggravated in various parts of our planet , and consequently world peace and security are gravely disturbed and peoples are suffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them .  
Other pressing issues include the population explosion , environmental degradation , the water shortage , desertification , the food deficit , the growing gap between the North and the South , the regional arms race , the threat posed by nuclear weapons , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , development concerns , barriers to economic and trade cooperation , the removal of restrictions on free trade and , last but not least , human rights .  
Moreover , Greece has supported all international initiatives aimed at further promoting Balkan regional cooperation , such as the conference of ministers of southeastern Europe which convened this year in Sofia and which will meet again in Thessaloniki in June of next year the European Royaumont initiative and the United States southeast European cooperative initiative .  
Any government , institution or individual seeking to promote human rights should bear in mind the significance of national and regional peculiarities as well as historical , cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage of economic development .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
Every State has the right to choose its political , economic and social system , to preserve its natural resources and to resort to peaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputes within the context of bilateral , regional and international initiatives and endeavours .  
The economic and social gap between the nations of the world is still wide in spite of positive political and economic developments on the regional and international scene , the creation of economic blocs , and free trade in the world .  
We must undertake major structural reforms , enlarge the Security Council membership in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution , and improve the functioning of the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies , so that they can respond adequately to current regional and international developments .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
Since the beginning of this decade the United Nations has initiated and organized a number of world summit conferences on a set of global issues ranging from environment to social development , from population to human rights , from women to children and coming up we have the World Food Summit , the aim of which is to find and implement coordinated measures at all levels national , regional , and international to solve problems of importance for the future of all nations .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
We therefore share the anguish of the international community for those countries where internal strife and regional conflict , and their attendant human suffering , continue to deny economic and social progress to millions of their people . 
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
Its objectives responsible management , food security , development of human resources , the proper and effective use of natural resources , cooperation and economic regional integration are ambitious but feasible .  
Today , the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successful accomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct the social and economic infrastructure of the southern part of the Republic , which was devastated by the civil war ; to reintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the national economy on a new basis ; and to convert the distorted centralized national economy that we inherited into a modern market economy .  
ECLAC has rendered valuable service through subprogrammes on economic development , social development , international trade , development financing and transport , industrial , agricultural , and technological modernization , environment , natural resources and human settlements , statistics and economic projections , the integration of women into development , regional integration and cooperation , economic and social planning and population .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
The Commonwealth of Dominica has taken steps , commensurate with its limited resources , to deal with the problem at the national level , and it is a party to cooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding the trans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbean region .  
Given the proliferation of internal conflicts and regional tensions , the harmful effects of economic disorder , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the rise of crime and terrorism , violations of human rights , the ever-widening international character of drug-trafficking networks and the deterioration of the environment , there is no single area of international relations that does not require a collective effort on the part of States if it is to be mastered . 
Chowdhury ( Bangladesh ) : At its fiftieth session the General Assembly reaffirmed the commitments made by the Heads of the State or Government at Copenhagen and decided to give highest priority to the national , regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition , based on full participation by all .  
Intensified cooperation on their part with the United Nations system at the global , regional and national levels in the area of economic and social development would be most desirable to ensure coherent development efforts to produce fruitful results .  
Moreover , it is precisely in situations requiring difficult choices that the objectives , commitments and Programme of Action adopted in Copenhagen can be given specific meaning , despite various obstacles which limit the leeway of decision makers .  The objectives and commitments of the world social Summit can be inconvenient in practice , or can conflict with other priorities at the local , regional and international levels .  
My delegation is convinced that international cooperation at all levels bilateral , regional and global is crucial for the effective implementation of the goals of the social Summit .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
We must also work as speedily as possible on the creation of a stable system of regional security , without which the process of aggressive separatism that has contributed to the political and economic disintegration of traditional regional structures of mutually beneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges will only grow , hastening the division of regions into hostile microsystems under the permanent influence of neighbouring regional Powers . 
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
The convening of many international conferences in the past decade to articulate and codify further norms of behaviour for an orderly new system , the relative success of the United Nations machinery in preventing and de-escalating many international and regional conflicts , and the constructive debate on reinvigorating the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council are positive examples providing hopeful signals in that direction .  
In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns , the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate and pursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greater regional confidence ; enhancing respect for principles of international law ; bringing about transparency in armaments and reduction of military spending ; creating zones free from weapons of mass destruction ; strengthening peace and security through persistent endeavours to encourage and facilitate understanding and conciliation ; and consolidating economic cooperation .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
Instead of continuing to be caught up in a log-jam with no solution in sight , the concept of permanent regional representation offers a practical alternative and a viable model for the future structure of the Security Council .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
This obliges States , within the framework of the United Nations system , to go beyond their traditional activities and jointly engage in management activities in the Organization based on the new cultural , economic and geographical reality made up of broad functional regional areas .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The review recognized that , while some encouraging progress has been made in social and economic development , in increasing democratization , in regional integration and in conflict prevention , management and resolution at the regional level , this progress has been uneven , and much remains to be done , as has been outlined , inter alia , in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit ( A / 50 / 885 ) .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
The external environment must be supportive of the identified critical interventions for African development and recovery in such areas as the diversification of their export products , intensification of regional integration , human resource development , the provision of adequate resource flows and durable solutions to their external debts .  
Also at the fourth ministerial meeting , South Africa and the member States emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation among member States of the zone , in law enforcement agencies and within the international and regional organizations in the fight against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .  
Despite the importance of bilateral relations and successful regional organizations , the United Nations remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a multipolar and democratic one . 
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
The successful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relations based on internationally accepted principles can not be replaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitious regional associations .  
Due to our own painful past experiences , my delegation also commends the ongoing efforts of the Department of Public Information in encouraging the development of a free and responsible press as an essential element for effective democratization through its series of regional seminars , organized in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and supported by UNDP , on promoting pluralistic and independent media .  
At the two previous sessions of the General Assembly , we pointed out that the lack of visible signs of understanding and tangible measures on the part of the developed nations in assisting the new and restored democracies could be interpreted as an unfavourable external factor and have serious consequences for both national harmony and regional stability .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
Peace in the Middle East will not be comprehensive or lasting until a strict regime for regional security is established , based on arrangements that provide equal security for all parties with minimum levels of armament .  
The machinery of the process took the form of numerous negotiating tracks , from a bilateral track to negotiate a withdrawal from the occupied territories , to a multilateral track to negotiate regional questions , such as disarmament , water , Palestinian refugees and the establishment of regional economic cooperation , which , from the outset , was believed to be the next logical step once peace had been secured through a just and comprehensive political settlement .  
Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
Bangladesh welcomed the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action , which embodied practical commitments and priorities for action at the national , regional and international levels for preventing the commercial sexual exploitation of children , and for protecting and reintegrating the children who were its victims . 
The long-standing bipolar nuclear confrontation has been replaced by mostly regional , subregional and intra-State conflicts arising from political , economic and social difficulties , and by massive violations of human rights , including those of ethnic minorities .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
It should be noted that meetings of experts or decision makers and workshops organized within the United Nations system also provide opportunities to exchange updated technological or policy-related information that is vital in elaborating regional or global strategies for social and economic development with the use of remote sensing technologies .  
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
The UNEP contribution will also include , depending on the availability of funds , establishment of regional expert panels to develop suitable classification systems and to evaluate the accuracy and utility of national , continental and global data sets being developed under land-cover characterization studies .  
Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication , local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed , and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence .  
The Republic of Croatia , being cognizant that the overall peace process in the former Yugoslavia is at a delicate stage and being fully determined to contribute to peace and stability in the region , would support a continued deployment of United Nations military observers in the area of the Prevlaka peninsula in Croatia , with an understanding that such deployment shall be a short-term interim arrangement , until , as proposed by my Government , the United Nations arrangement is replaced by a regional arrangement .  
Whereas in the past , neighbouring States had been wary of South Africa 's military strength , South Africa 's current deliberate policy of transparency and the concerted use of common resources to ensure regional stability should form the basis for fruitful cooperation between States in the future .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .

Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;

The effective elimination of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , " ethnic cleansing " and religious and other forms of intolerance requires concerted efforts by the entire international community : Governments , United Nations programmes and agencies , and regional and non-governmental organizations .  
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
The Economic and Social Council decides to consider at its substantive session of 1996 , under the item entitled " Regional cooperation in the economic , social and related fields " , in pursuance of Council resolution 1982 / 50 of 28 July 1982 and taking into account the joint recommendation made by the executive secretaries of the regional commissions pursuant to Council decision 1982 / 174 of 30 July 1982 , the question of " Trends in regional economic and social cooperation , including trade issues and the work of the regional commissions in this regard " .

Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and , in that regard , to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Supports the concern of the Central American countries to create a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces and the pre-eminence of civil authority , urges the Central American Security Commission to pursue negotiations for the preparation of the treaty on democratic security in Central America , which constitutes one of the basic aims of the Central American Integration System , and requests the Secretary-General to provide it with the requisite support in a timely manner ;  
Concerns of Member States , while often based upon similar scientific and socio-economic premises , are voiced by different governmental representatives in different intergovernmental forums and in different ways , depending upon the constituencies , with the result that there is a lack of coherent policy within the United Nations system ( at global , regional and national levels ) ;  
Calling the attention of the international community to the role of oceans and coastal areas as a major governing force of the planetary ecosystem , as well as a determining factor of human life , recommend that greater priority be accorded at national , regional and international levels to the action set out in chapter 17 of Agenda 21 ;  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
One of the purposes of the Central American Integration System , as set forth in the Tegucigalpa Protocol , is to attain the sustainable development of Central America , which presupposes defining a new , unique , comprehensive and indivisible regional security model inspired by the region 's achievements during its intensive process of pacification and integration ;  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
The report , which shall be a classified State and regional document , shall be drawn up in accordance with the format and contents determined by the Security Commission and shall include all naval , air , land and public security data needed for the information provided to be complete , transparent and verifiable , solely and exclusively by the organs of the model established in article 47 of this Treaty or by those designated by them ;  
The living and working conditions in all human settlements , including regional urban centres , rural service centres , rural hamlets , rural communities , market towns and villages , must be improved , with particular emphasis on shelter , social and physical infrastructure , and services .  
The tools for achieving a physically more balanced development include not only specific urban and regional policies and legal , economic , financial , cultural and other measures , but also innovative methods of urban planning and design and of urban development , renewal and management .  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
Undertaking the valuation of the goods and services of a forest at local , national , regional and global levels is a complex and costly exercise that must be carried out in response to specific demands and guided by the type of decisions for which the results are to be used .  
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Using resources and economic instruments in an effective , efficient and equitable manner at the local , national , regional and international levels ;  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Commending all countries and intergovernmental and regional organizations that have actively engaged in regional and subregional assessments of vulnerability to natural hazards and have consequently initiated regional and subregional cooperation in the field of disaster reduction , including the exchange of data and technology , as well as the development of joint administrative , technological and scientific approaches for applied disaster reduction ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
Developing countries are faced with a wide range of development and environmental problems perceived as being more immediate than the global or regional atmospheric issues that are projected to affect future generations .  
Assessments of the potential impact of variability and change of climate and the atmospheric environment were conducted by some countries through bilateral and multilateral support and as part of the UNEP-implemented World Climate Impact and Response Strategies Programme concerning areas both within and outside their national jurisdiction , including studies of vulnerability to sealevel rise , effects on agriculture , forests and other sensitive and important sectors , either as single or regional group efforts .  
The regional project , " Asia least-cost greenhouse gas abatement strategy " , funded by the Asian Development Bank with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) executing part of the programme , is designed to assist the 12 participating countries in improving estimates of the emissions and sinks of the principal GHGs and in undertaking economic , technological and environmental analyses of options for reducing future emissions and enhancing sinks .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
The Executive Director of UNDCP has encouraged resident coordinators and resident representatives , as well as the directors of UNDCP regional and country offices , to pursue closely all channels to enhance an integrated approach to problems touching on the mandates of several agencies , thus consolidating scarce resources in an effective manner by eliminating overlap and proliferation of parallel interventions .  
Reaffirms further that electoral assistance to Member States should be provided by the United Nations only at the request and with the consent of specific sovereign States , by virtue of resolutions adopted by the Security Council or the General Assembly in each case , in strict conformity with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States , or in special circumstances such as cases of decolonization , or in the context of regional or international peace processes ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development and the environment , as well as other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to increase their involvement in formal and non-formal education in human rights and to cooperate with the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Also reiterates the call for formulating or strengthening by 1996 comprehensive cross-sectoral strategies for implementing the outcome of the Summit and national strategies for social development , including government action , actions by States in cooperation with other Governments and international , regional and subregional organizations , and actions taken in partnership and cooperation with actors of civil society , the private sector and cooperatives , with specific responsibilities to be undertaken by each actor and with agreed priorities and time-frames ;  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;

Taking into consideration the will of the Central American Presidents to adopt a national and regional strategy entitled " Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America " 6 / as a comprehensive initiative in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , which includes a redefining of the relations of Central America with the international community and is aimed at improving the well-being of the peoples of the subregion ,  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Each conference made major recommendations , which will have an impact on the ways in which national Governments will function , and point to the need for an effective and efficient public administration system in planning and implementing those recommendations and for the support and cooperation of relevant United Nations and other international and regional institutions in assisting Governments to improve their public administration systems .  
To strengthen effective collaboration and coordination among various programmes in governance and public management currently carried out by various United Nations agencies , including Bretton-Woods institutions such as the World Bank and IMF , it is recommended that the consultative group include representation from all relevant United Nations agencies , regional commissions and the World Bank . The group will also be open to other interregional and regional governmental organizations and appropriate international or regional professional and research institutions .  
While the main efforts for administrative improvement must be initiated and sustained at the national level , it needs to be recognized that technical cooperation with international and regional institutions , including regional United Nations agencies , will be vital in assisting and supporting the process of improvement .  
UNDCP will seek to be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors , international financial institutions , agencies and programmes within the United Nations system and regional organizations involved in development work .  
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
During its fourth world conference on crime prevention and criminal justice , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation decided , inter alia , to establish a working group with the aim of studying the issues of extradition and mutual legal assistance in Asia and the Pacific , taking into account other experiences at the regional and international levels .  
In cooperation with specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations , the Mission will take part in the clearance and verification of heavily mined areas throughout the territory , particularly the main supply routes between the major regional areas and Luanda , which are considered paramount in the deployment of UNAVEM III and the free circulation of goods and persons .  
Taking into account the geographical size of the Mission area and the number of military and civilian personnel and the premises of UNAVEM III , it is considered essential that personnel from the aforementioned sections be deployed in the regional headquarters to administer and monitor related activities under the supervision of their respective sections at Mission headquarters .  
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,

As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources .

Take note of the progress report , submitted by UNCTAD , of the analytical study on the relationship of environmental protection to international competitiveness , job creation and development , and invite UNCTAD to elaborate on the study , with the contributions of Governments , regional economic integration organizations , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and other relevant regional and international organizations , and to submit the results to the Commission at its fifth session , in 1997 .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Since the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan have made a strong statement on behalf of the world community and have already drawn attention to this pressing issue , the focus should be on implementation and development of other practical measures and instruments to combat organized transnational crime .  NULLIn the view of Cuba , in order to combat organized transnational crime it is not enough to merely establish or even ratify various regional or international instruments .  
During the last 40 years , the congresses have served as global events and worldwide forums , influencing national policies , mobilizing public opinion , recommending lines of action at the national , regional and international levels , and focusing attention on major issues of concern to Member States and the professional and scientific community .  2 Over the years , the congresses have undergone a significant transformation .

96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
Such tools , revised to suit the local legal system and local practice , could be used at the regional and national levels and could form the basis for joint activities with other relevant international organizations .  
Within ECO , a committee had been established to coordinate regional cooperation , an expert group had been formed to prepare plans of action that would serve as a framework and mechanism for specific cooperative projects , and an action plan had been adopted for drug control in the region covered by ECO .

The two sides consider that in preserving the main responsibility of the Security Council of safeguarding world peace and security , and in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter , efforts should be made to promote cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in preventing and mediating peacefully disputes and conflicts , and to promote more constructive and healthy coordination between the non-governmental organizations engaged in economic and social development , humanitarian assistance and other areas , and the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the above areas .  
The Committee was informed , upon request , that the amount of $ 2.5-million had been based on prior experience in other missions for disposal of hazardous waste , such as contaminated petrol , oil and lubricants , batteries and used tyres and other toxic wastes ; that in the past , those requirements had been provided under transport operations ; and that , in view of the strict regional laws regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes , UNPF had made the provision based on Croatia 's requirement that such waste be disposed of by Government-licensed contractors .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .

The situation foreseen for the period covered by the plan calls for urban development policies that focus on economic , social and environmental aspects and will be designed as an integral part of wider regional planning policies .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .

AL-MUALLA ( United Arab Emirates ) said that the international community had in recent years set about elaborating plans for the advancement of women that were in keeping with contemporary aspirations for global progress towards societies in which women and men played complementary and active roles in meeting the needs of national , regional and international development .  
The State had supported national women 's organizations through the General Union of Women , which had assumed responsibility for addressing various women 's issues and for implementing social and cultural activities and had given women an opportunity to participate in relevant regional and international activities .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Welcomes action at the national and regional level by small island developing States , and invites all Governments , with the assistance of international and regional organizations , to continue to support and to provide information on all of their major activities under the Programme of Action so as to enable an adequate review of the aforementioned action taken at the national and regional level ;  
In conclusion , he urged all Parties to encourage the establishment or strengthening of national climate committees , as well as national and regional action plans for climate change , in support of the Climate Agenda , an inter-agency initiative to establish an integrated framework for international climate-related scientific and technical programmes , and reaffirmed WMO 's strong commitment to fully support the Convention and its implementation process . implemented jointly . 
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
In practical terms , this should ensure that States carrying considerable weight in the international political and economic arena Germany and Japan for example as well other influential countries in regional and global terms , could assume the responsibility of permanent status in the Security Council . 
The Conference expressed concern at the escalation of armed hostilities in Afghanistan , which had resulted in immense human losses and irreparable damage to the country in the economic , social and cultural spheres , and endangered regional peace , stability and security .  
The Conference decided to take appropriate follow-up measures at the regional level within the framework of the United Nations , with a view to actively pursuing ways and means of bringing about cessation of internal hostilities and facilitating the ongoing peacemaking efforts , in contact and collaboration with various Afghan groups , pertinent international organizations and States with interest and influence .  
Being a comprehensive instrument also , the Convention holds considerable " strategic importance . . . as a framework for national , regional and global action in the marine sector " ( resolution 49 / 28 , preamble ) , with further implications , in turn , for the manner in which the system of ocean institutions will evolve , in particular the core institutions established by the Convention . 
Important objectives for further development of global and regional legal regimes and management policies would be the re-establishment of a balance between fishing efforts and fishing yields , proper enforcement of agreed conservation measures , the regulation and control of all catches ( including those from the high seas ) and the offsetting of all catches ( including discards ) against the determined quotas for each stock .  
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .  
While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .  
It is therefore the humble submission of my country that , based on the United Nations principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members , of universality of membership , and of equitable geographical representation , the South Pacific region , which includes the island nations along with Australia and New Zealand , should be recognized as a geopolitical region for the purpose of regional representation and membership of the Security Council .  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
It is heartening to note that , avoiding a pitfall encountered in the past , African countries and their development partners successfully concluded their discussion and analysis of the performance of all the parties involved , even in such controversial areas as political and economic reform , promotion of the private sector , human development , regional and subregional cooperation and integration , resource flows , external debt , trade , economic diversification and capacity-building .

A five-year plan had been prepared for the Afro-Colombian population to give impetus to the organization of their communities , through the strengthening of advisory committees at the departmental , regional and district levels and the undertaking of research projects , and particularly one aimed at compiling basic statistical data on that population group and another aimed at preparing a map of socio-cultural zones and regions with majority black populations .  The five-year plan also provided for dissemination activities in coordination with the mass media .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
All norms and principles of human rights enshrined in regional and international human rights instruments and covenants shall be an integral part of the constitution of the Sudan and any law , decree , executive order or policy measure contrary thereto shall be considered null and void and unconstitutional ;

More attention should also be paid to the activities of non-governmental scholarly bodies , such as the International Law Association , and the regional consultative committees , as well as to the valuable activity of bodies connected with the Council of Europe which were active in promoting the application of international law .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
While the international community was giving considerable attention to the promotion and protection of human rights , and while the international and regional human rights mechanisms had therefore gained in effectiveness , it nevertheless had to be recognized that much more needed to be done to check the wave of reported and noted violations , especially in view of the geopolitical instability , regional and ethnic conflicts and recent social turmoil .  
Although the focus of the proposed programme on the three major themes of regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , and poverty alleviation , is welcomed , there may be a need to sharpen the subprogramme elements further to better reflect desired activities in conformity with relevant legislative mandates , including the recently held United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) .  
Several options may be considered , such as : ( a ) encouraging governments to provide greater support to national , regional and international institutions ; ( b ) requesting the governing bodies of international organizations to give a high priority to work in support of the UNFCCC process ; ( c ) revising the guidance to the GEF so as to encourage support for specific methodological issues ; and ( d ) providing for additions to the secretariat budget and / or contributions to the supplementary fund for the period 1998-1999 .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Despite the existence of hundreds of bilateral or regional agreements regulating the use of international watercourses , it had been felt that those rules and prevailing customary international law were still vague and did not cover all the practical problems which might arise between riparian States , especially the problem of water pollution .  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
To criminalize in an effective manner acts of bribery in international commercial transactions of any public official or elected representative , by any private or public corporation or individual , taking action where appropriate in a coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Attempts to separate international and regional systems for protecting human rights were artificial ; both systems should be complementary and mutually supportive .  
The main conclusions and recommendations in that regard were : to prepare and submit to the General Assembly for consideration a comprehensive strategic programme of cooperation with regional organizations in peacekeeping and other peace-related activities , for the development of which it was necessary to establish a project team composed of representatives of all departments concerned ; to conclude bilateral framework agreements between United Nations and regional organizations concerning practical aspects of peacekeeping and other peace-related activities ; and to create a mechanism for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
REZVANI ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) said that regional institutions and instruments played a key role in the promotion and protection of human rights , and were capable of reflecting regional political , social , cultural and economic factors .  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .

The suffering of the Afghan civilian population , who continue to bear the main brunt of the civil war , and the dangers that that war creates for regional stability , oblige the international community to intensify its search for a peaceful solution , despite the fact that certain Afghan parties seem to continue to favour the military option .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,

Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;

All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
While bilateral aid from donor countries , support from governmental agencies , assistance from international agencies , international development and aid institutions have an important role in supplementing national and regional endeavours in this regard , it is essential that due importance be given to development mechanisms that are better able to cope with the transboundary movement of marine resources and to address the transboundary nature of marine environmental problems .  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .

Nonetheless , the ] [ The Panel was convinced of the necessity of having a set of criteria and indicators wide enough to be used at the global level , rather than a reduced core set that might prevent the mutual recognition of regional and national initiatives , the exchange of information and the further elaboration of the issues of best forest practices and voluntary codes .  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
The Panel underscored the need for international institutions to support national , [ subregional ] [ subnational ] , regional and international action towards sustainable forest management , [ building a consensus on approaches [ and standards ] worldwide and improving the conditions for adequate capacity-building and financing ] [ to build consensus on approaches and better coordinate their international cooperation efforts ] for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] .

On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , in 1998 , major celebratory events will be organized at the international , regional and national levels , during which the importance of universal knowledge and understanding of the provisions of the Universal Declaration will be emphasized .  
All regional organizations , national focal points and other interested partners in the Decade will be requested to report to the High Commissioner for purposes of his mid-term evaluation in the year 2000 , and again for his final report in 2004 , on progress made since the completion of the survey , including celebratory events held and versions of the Universal Declaration available , and on continuing needs and challenges in the achievement of the objectives of these programme elements .  
For purposes of the High Commissioner 's report , all participating national focal points , international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , specialized agencies and programmes , and interested others , shall be requested to provide relevant information to the High Commissioner , based upon their own independent assessments and activities .  
The national , regional and international structures and networks established under the Decade should continue to serve as permanent focal and contact points for international cooperation in the field of human rights education , and the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights , in cooperation with UNESCO , should maintain , and make available upon request , a current roster of such organizations and focal points .  
This stage is characterized by the formation of a vision of the place and the role of these two organizations within the framework of the comprehensive security model for the twenty-first century currently being developed ; by an intensification of the process of determining innovative ways effectively to implement the principles and obligations set forth in the United Nations Charter and in the basic documents of the OSCE ; and by the search for new forms of cooperation aimed at finding acceptable formulas for the solution of existing regional problems .  
Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs , including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence .  
His delegation was also encouraged by regional activities designed to implement Agenda 21 and by the fact that , at the national level , approximately 100 countries had reformed their institutional structures with a view to achieving sustainable development .  
Since her country attached the greatest importance to the recommendations of the Ninth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders , held in Cairo in 1995 , it had developed bilateral , regional and multilateral cooperative links with a view to promoting joint policies , programmes and mechanisms for crime prevention and law enforcement .  
Illicit drugs were not a great social problem in his country , but it recognized their evil effects , and had therefore taken part in relevant international and regional conferences , and had signed bilateral agreements and international conventions .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
The pivotal role of regional organizations in democratizing development should be enhanced by opening channels to the regional level for the views of those at the local level , and by reducing bureaucratic obstacles to the flow or volume of assistance ; the United Nations regional economic and social commissions are well placed to contribute to such an effort .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country ; a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated ; and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
The Cape Town Workshop encourages governments , international and regional organizations as well as non _ governmental organizations and civil society to promote a debate on the need for and use of minimum humanitarian standards or standards of humanity applicable in all circumstances as well as on practical measures aimed at the improvement of the situation of those affected .  
We therefore organized national workshops and two regional workshops to discuss internal problems , to collect input from the persons directly concerned , including those responsible for violations and the victims and those in charge of the administration of justice and those to whom it is administered , to publicize the progress of the research and to make the final results known .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
As indicated in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General , an additional eight United Nations Volunteers would be assigned to the eight regional offices to carry out education and promotion tasks , coordinated by the MINUGUA Education and Promotion Unit , which , in conjunction with the Indigenous Affairs Unit , would design a comprehensive training programme aimed at indigenous leaders , civil and military authorities and non-governmental organizations .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
After having considered the note , the Executive Committee , at its forty-seventh session , adopted a conclusion on comprehensive and regional approaches within a protection framework , 4 which identified certain principal elements of protection-based comprehensive approaches and encouraged States , in coordination and cooperation with each other , and with international organizations , if applicable , to consider the adoption of such approaches . 
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .  
Notes with appreciation the timely production of the new , comprehensive report on the state of the world environment , Global Environment Outlook-1,4 as requested by the Council in its decision 18 / 27 C of 26 May 1995 , as well as the participatory assessment process ( known as the Global Environment Outlook process ) which has been established to support United Nations Environment Programme assessment activities , and its components ( scientific working groups , network of collaborating centres , regional and United Nations-wide consultative mechanisms ) ;  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
The technical cooperation programme has focused on incorporating international human rights standards in national legal systems , developing policies and practices and building national capacities and regional structures for the promotion and protection of all human rights , democracy and the rule of law .  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
In its foreign relations , Viet Nam will constantly pursue an open foreign policy of independence , diversification and the promotion of multilateral relations along the line of gradual regional and international integration , thus making worthy contributions to the cause of peace , national independence , democracy and social progress .  
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
At the same time , my country reaffirms the pressing importance of the promotion of wide-ranging global and regional cooperation , based on shared perceptions within a broad framework , in order to address social , economic and developmental problems and to ensure the protection of human rights and other basic freedoms .  
These challenges have indeed crossed national boundaries to become global issues , and Governments are less able than ever to deal with them alone , without cooperation and mutual coordination , whether on the bilateral , regional or international level . 
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
From 1995 to the present SELA has accomplished a fundamental reorientation and adaptation in order to achieve two main objectives : first , to help the 27 members become integrated into the current international environment and , secondly , to coordinate their agendas for regional , hemispheric and international actions .  
In its guidelines for action for the period 1997 to 2000 , the Latin American Economic System has defined its role as an institution for promoting coordination and cooperation among its member States in pursuing the following main objectives : to secure the timely and adequate participation of the 27 member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the rapidly changing world economy ; to contribute to strengthening the regional integration process , both among ourselves and with the outside world ; and to enhance the global competitiveness of member States . 
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
Unfortunately , the world continues to witness many , not fewer , incidents of just and unjust wars , regional conflicts , civil and ethnic strife , acute forms of suffering , environmental degradation and unmitigated endangerment of life itself .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
Furthermore , the need calls for strengthening coordination between the aforementioned and other regional and international development programmes , and first and foremost the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , in order to mobilize economic resources and their generous influx of contributions required for a speedy response to the needs of affected and vulnerable peoples .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
Escaping this state of mind and building a new world based on cooperation and the rule of law requires not only political will , but careful planning in order to foster confidence and to mitigate economic , security and social concerns at national and regional levels .  
Terrorism is the wicked result of widespread lawlessness and the violent obstruction of public participation , which in its various forms and manifestations threatens human societies at the national , regional and international levels . 
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
The conditions that prevailed prior to the establishment of the zones included , inter alia , peaceful relations and mutual confidence , economic cooperation and a general belief in the enhancement of common interests through institutional regional frameworks .  
The participating States reached agreements concerning their future actions in various fields of regional cooperation , such as political cooperation ; stability and development of good-neighbourly relations ; economic cooperation in fields of mutual interest ; joint actions for environmental protection ; promotion of humanitarian , social and cultural cooperation ; cooperation in law enforcement , justice and combating organized crime , terrorism , drugs and arms trafficking .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
The process for elaborating a common vision , as outlined in document E / CN . 16 / 1997 / CRP . 2 , should be anchored in effective international cooperation , with a recognized role and responsibility for the United Nations system ; should bridge conceptual and practical issues ; and should combine both global and regional dimensions .  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Inspired by the purposes and principles of the Damascus Declaration , and on the basis of the role played by member States in promoting Arab solidarity , advancing the interests of the Arab nation and safeguarding joint national security ; in response to current requirements , and in the light of international and regional developments , particularly with regard to the peace process , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs affirmed their absolute commitment to work in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Arab Summit Conference held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June 1996 .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
The revitalized regional integration initiative of Kenya , the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda , now called the East African Cooperation , provided expanded markets for local manufacturing output among member countries .  Also , the signing of a new trade protocol among the member countries of the Southern African Development Community has paved the way for expanded markets and increased trade among the Community 's member States , although regional manufacturing is increasingly dominated by South Africa .  
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
In addition to its influence on the regular programme of work of the Conference , the increase in the number of ECE member countries , which has greatly extended the number of countries in the region in need of technical assistance , has obliged ECE to appoint regional advisers , including on economic statistics , and to seek to provide other forms of technical assistance , such as through a UNDP-funded project in social and demographic statistics .  
Within that meeting , a programme of activities has been developed and the functions of regional and international cooperation in the statistical field have been distributed in the areas of national accounts ; environmental statistics ; dissemination of information ; and social and demographic indicators .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Following a presentation of current economic patterns at the global and regional levels and an overview of sectoral social issues , the report examines selected aspects of the three main themes of the Summit : eradication of poverty , expansion of productive employment and social integration .  
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , States have the duty , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms , in accordance with international human rights standards .  
In spite of their transitory nature , those fluctuations may , owing to their echo-effect , cause significant longer-term changes in the age structure of populations at the local , national or even regional levels , such as an unusual increase or decrease in the number of older persons ( for instance , due to surges of refugees in sub-Saharan Africa ) , or an increase in the numbers of older widows ( due to increased male mortality among the older working-age groups in several European countries in transition from centrally planned economies ) .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
What is remarkable is that although Zaire is losing on the battlefield , the head of State has emerged stronger : stronger with the armed forces , which call for his leadership ; stronger in international affairs , since he is seen as the only person capable of resolving a regional crisis ; and stronger in politics , since even his most critical opponents have joined him in the effort of national reconciliation .  
The Begeer report assumed that the existing international statistical system , which is decentralized in both the subject and regional dimensions , would continue unchanged , an assumption that is critical to its recommendations .  
Reporting to the Senior Demobilization Officer the incumbent would ( a ) coordinate field operations , including direction of their day-to-day operations ; ( b ) supervise regional demobilization officers and health and child soldier coordinators ; ( c ) manage and ensure timely availability and delivery of resources to demobilization sites ; ( d ) ensure that demobilization centres operate according to standard operational procedures ; and ( e ) participate in planning and policy development and catalyse efficient use of resources in the field . a Contribution for humanitarian assistance only .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
Aware that involuntary , mass displacement , in addition to the human suffering involved , imposes significant economic and social burdens and may affect security and stability at the regional level ,  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to alleviate the deteriorating living conditions of increasing populations in both urban and rural settlements ,  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
For retransmission of major national and international events and to meet a variety of needs , the ONPT also has an Earth mobile station which is used for occasional remote sensing and telephony , and which can operate with international and regional satellites .  
In its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission again requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the cooperation with UNDCP , including the undertaking of joint initiatives , and called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services and the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , UNDP , the World Bank and international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , utilizing the expertise of the Programme .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
Following the precedent of the seventeenth special session , the preparatory body may wish to recommend that the vice-presidents of the upcoming special session should be the same as those of the fifty-second regular session of the General Assembly , on the understanding that the regional groups may make substitutions of the vice-presidents allocated to each group .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , learning , training and sharing of experiences , materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Such efforts should be pursued in close cooperation with community and religious leaders and non-governmental organizations , at all levels of the State , i.e . national , regional , zonal and woreda levels , and special emphasis should be placed on the need to coordinate the policies designed to implement the Convention between central and local authorities .  
To this end , the resident representatives worked in partnership throughout 1996 with all relevant headquarters units , particularly with ( a ) the regional bureaux , which provided the supporting management framework , advice , training and , together with the Office of Human Resources ( OHR ) , assistance in matching core competencies with country office needs and ( b ) the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support ( BPPS ) , which supplied analytical tools , developed in consultation with country offices , global studies and methodological guidance .  
Among the key recommendations incorporated as a result of the evaluation were : networking among existing regional institutions rather than building new ones ; forming steering committees comprising focal points to manage projects ; and revitalizing the use of intergovernmental meetings as the best mechanism for approving important regional initiatives .  50 .  Another important initiative was the RBAS Quarterly Brief .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
At its 2nd plenary meeting , on 7 February 1997 , the Economic and Social Council decided to consider at its substantive session of 1997 , under the item entitled " Regional cooperation " , in pursuance of Council resolution 1982 / 50 of 28 July 1982 and taking into account the joint recommendations made by the executive secretaries of the regional commissions pursuant to Council decision 1982 / 174 of 30 July 1982 , the question of review and reform of the regional commissions .  
Strategies need to be devised to secure new means of financing ICT investment , strengthening indigenous scientific and technological research capabilities , and helping to improve each country \ x { e5b8 } capacity to participate in the formulation and assess the impact of the new international rules of the game that are being established in international and regional fora .  
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
Instead of this differentiation , advocacy work will be treated as an essential component of all of the organization 's work , since it is a critical element in enabling UNIFEM to influence policy changes and legal reforms at a systemic level , both within the United Nations system and at regional and country levels .  
While it is obvious that global environmental threats , such as global warming , need to be tackled on a worldwide level , many problems of resource degradation and environmental pollution arise and can most effectively be addressed at the regional level . 
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
The Panel also emphasized the need for efforts to enhance comparability and compatibility between various international and regional processes on the development and implementation of criteria and indicators , and stressed the importance of mutual recognition among sets of criteria and indicators as tools for assessing trends in forest management and conditions at the national level ; and on transparent methods for the measurement of indicators and for the collection , assembly , storage and dissemination of data .  
The Panel agreed that forest-related international , regional and bilateral agencies and organizations , existing legal instruments , financial and trade institutions and treaty bodies should mobilize their respective strengths and capacities in implementing the proposals for action in the Panel 's report , and should further promote policy dialogue , consensus-building and international cooperation , recalling Agenda 21 and paragraph 10 of the Forest Principles .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
The Division concluded that in future it would ( a ) only undertake projects in areas where the need for the analytical and technical capacity of the Division was apparent ; ( b ) support and encourage greater involvement of the regional commissions ; ( c ) assign higher priority to projects that emphasized training and short-term technical assistance ; and ( d ) participate in implementing statistical projects only when projects were of significant international or methodological interest or where staff exposure through participation in project activities was seen as a learning opportunity .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Intergovernmental dialogue on sustainable development could usefully be reorganized to consider a limited number of strategic priority issues , so as to develop a more focused approach to relevant activities in the United Nations system both at the international and at the regional and country levels .  
Task managers should be encouraged to promote joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , and to foster a more integrated approach which incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development .  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Regretting the failure of the three Western countries to respond positively to international and regional endeavours and to the efforts made to devise a settlement based on the principles of international law , in a context of mutual understanding and constructive dialogue , with the result that the Security Council , following its consultations of 14 March 1997 , extended the embargo measures imposed on the Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ,  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
Request the Chairman of the Commission , when appointing special rapporteurs , to continue to consult closely with regional groups and ensure that the appointee is of recognized standing in the field of human rights , has an overall knowledge of political , social and legal systems , is sensitive to different cultural , religious and ethnic particularities , and will accordingly implement his mandate independently , impartially and objectively ;  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
This requires that they be included in economic and military matters , in both multilateral and bilateral diplomacy , and in official delegations to international and regional conferences .  
Organizations of the United Nations system and various economic , political and military structures at the regional level have become important international public employers , but here , too , women have remained a minority concentrated in lower-level positions .  
Although the regional and subregional presence of the United Nations system is increasing , there is no apparent overarching framework to guide that process , and each organization is pursuing its distinctive approach , which may have practical value , but the overall value and impact of the United Nations system could be enhanced through a more coordinated approach .  
An important dimension implicit in regional and subregional operational activities , that of the practice and potential for technical cooperation among developing countries , needs to be made more explicit so that more opportunities for such cooperation can be exploited .  
Recognizing further that the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Commission provides a historic opportunity for the Commission to bring about the wide participation of its members and associate members and to sharpen the focus of its work to enable it to respond more effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of the members and associate members within a rapidly changing global paradigm , including the changing scope of regional cooperation , by utilizing fully the multidisciplinary advantage of the Commission and its increased capability in technical assistance activities ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Review the salient issues in the regional strategies and action programmes emerging from recent global conferences , international conventions and agreements ; monitor the implementation of Agenda 21 at the regional level ; and articulate the region 's response to relevant global initiatives , ensuring that such initiatives support the development of the region .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
Convinced that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic , social and related fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of its subsidiary bodies located in the developing regions ,  
In addition , the Committee will promote the implementation of measures designed to strengthen economic cooperation and integration among African countries ; assist African countries and their intergovernmental organizations in making the policy instruments for economic cooperation and integration of the African region more effective ; and identify measures to coordinate and harmonize micro - and macroeconomic policies among African countries as a prerequisite for accelerating regional economic integration . 
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
In addition , as the work of both the Human Rights Committee and the regional monitoring bodies and the Special Rapporteur 's experience have shown , international monitoring is not only active but has been reinforced precisely because situations are involved , as has already been demonstrated , human rights stand a greater risk of being violated and require greater protection .  
It was only in this century , and more particularly after the Second World War , that human rights took on an international dimension as a result of the incorporation of their norms into a great variety of regional and universal treaties and conventions , thereby becoming one of the most dynamic and revolutionary branches of contemporary international public law .  
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
The use of a flexible , investigative and monitoring process comparable to that established by ECOSOC resolution 1503 ( XLVIII ) should be examined in the context of population transfers , together with the existing regional machinery for the protection of human rights , including quasi _ legal and political processes such as the Helsinki process , and the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution of the Organization of African Unity . 75 .  The Sub-Commission should look into the possibility of establishing an international trust fund for the rehabilitation of the survivors of population transfer .  
[ 43 ] / The main conclusion reached in this study on income distribution at the international level is to signal the need to include cooperation agreements tied to commercial agreements on free trade and economic and commercial cooperation , whether at the international , regional or bilateral level . 
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .  
Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
At the national , regional and international levels , judicial human rights bodies continued to develop the legal framework of refugee protection , further defining the scope of obligations towards asylum-seekers and adding content to the rule of non-refoulement , also in respect of persons facing a substantial risk of torture .  
The DCRK is a unified State of a confederal form in which a unified national Government is established on condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other 's ideas and systems , a Government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy respectively with equal power of authority and duties . 
Data from these surveys will serve a new major initiative , namely to establish a national strategy for increasing social productivity and reducing regional disparities ; this work supported by UNDP will be based on defining and mapping poverty , and on establishing a national poverty line or band . 
When ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to the present Convention , or at any time thereafter , a Party which is not a regional economic integration organization may declare in a written instrument submitted to the Depositary that , in respect of any dispute not resolved in accordance with paragraph 2 , it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any Party accepting the same obligation :  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
In paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , the General Assembly invited current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues .  
The expected outcome of the Conference is a Lisbon Declaration on Youth Policies and Programmes by ministers responsible for youth to further promote the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond through more focused and specific intersectoral measures at the regional , national and local / municipal levels .  
Confirming that at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , the international community recognized that there was a lack of knowledge about mountain ecosystems and called for renewed international and regional cooperation to develop an integrated approach for conserving , upgrading and using the land , water , plant , animal and human resources and promoting alternative livelihood opportunities for mountain inhabitants with a view to improving their living standards ,  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
A number of Governments have reported the conclusion of bilateral , multilateral or regional agreements or other arrangements to enhance coordination between their law enforcement agencies in operations aimed at suppressing illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including the provision of mutual legal assistance , technical equipment and training in modern techniques .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
In November 1996 , in the context of promoting bilateral and regional cooperation , the prime ministers of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania signed at Riga a declaration on the fight against money-laundering , drawn up in cooperation with UNDCP , the European Commission and the Financial Action Task Force established by the heads of State or Government of the seven major industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Operating through a regional unit , which was in contact with the national technical units , the project assisted countries in the formulation of policies and programmes in the social sector and sought to strengthen national management capabilities in the social sectors of the countries concerned with special emphasis on the sectors of basic education , health , nutrition and the strengthening of social investment funds .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
The initiatives funded represent a wide range of strategies undertaken by national and regional groups to eliminate gender-based violence : educational campaigns , capacity-building of womens organizations , changing relevant laws , making women aware of their rights , public education on laws and rights of women pertaining to violence in rural and urban communities , action-oriented research , strengthening womens advocacy skills in work on gender-based violence , violence against women migrant workers and various training programmes targeting police , judges , teachers , health workers , and public administrators .  
With reference to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , the countries of the Pacific region had expressed growing concern over the increased intensity and frequency of storms and typhoons in the region , with an impact that would continue to stretch their limited resources .  International assistance was required to make regional activities more efficient .  
In the coming months , Canada would continue to promote action in favour of sustainable development at various important regional and global meetings , and it was committed to cooperating for the achievement of satisfactory results at the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
During the FAO regional conference for Latin America and the Caribbean , held in Paraguay in July 1996 , it had been determined that , based on available natural , human and technological resources , the region could set two complementary goals for the year 2010 : to reduce malnutrition from 15 per cent in the period 1991-1992 to 6 per cent , and to ensure that the nutrition supply should be no less than 2,700 calories per person per day in any country .  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
The Government of Germany has already expressed its intention to support the programme in addition to its extensive national effort , including setting up a commission , advisory group and focal point , preparing a postage stamp series , making recommendations on a society for all ages , holding a national parliamentary assembly of older persons in the German Bundestag and many other regional , local and communal events .  
It could be argued that a staged approach for the penetration of foreign markets , starting from domestic markets and moving to regional ones which displayed similar sociocultural characteristics , could be a viable option .  
The meetings and talks that were held during the visit confirmed the broad convergence of the interests of the two States in the political , military and strategic and economic fields , and the similarity of their approaches to global and regional problems .  
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
With regard to the efforts to restructure UNHCR , his delegation supported the measures to increase its efficiency , while stressing that any lasting solution would have to be based on national , regional and international solidarity , which entailed the mobilization of considerable financial and human resources .  
In that connection , he cited the numerous initiatives that had been undertaken by the President of Tunisia , Mr . Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and his continuing efforts to promote peace in Africa . Tunisia called upon the parties concerned to halt the fighting and re-establish peace , and invited international and regional organizations to provide assistance to the victims in order to avert a tragedy that would affect the entire African continent . 
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
The granting of preferential access to external markets , through bilateral , regional and international agreements , would greatly enhance the investment promotion efforts of developing countries , particularly smaller economies , as a minimum market size is an important prerequisite for many investors .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
One level involves selective bilateral / trilateral free trade and integration agreements between interested countries outside the framework of existing subregional / regional integration groupings , mirroring the economic growth zone phenomenon in South-East Asia .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
We undertake to continue to coordinate our positions on these issues in regional and international forums and to contribute to the work of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the goal of intensifying the analysis of the question of the unilateral and extraterritorial application of national laws , strengthening multilateralism through the application of the international agreements signed by States and guiding the external conduct of our countries on the basis of international law .  
The Committee notes that the Governing Council of UNEP , in its decision 19 / 31 of 7 February 1997 , requested the Executive Director to strengthen the regional offices of UNEP by providing them with appropriate functional and administrative capabilities to enable decentralized implementation of regional environmental programmes and priorities , as developed by regional and subregional ministerial meetings .  
On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .  The Chinese Government adheres to Mr . Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on diplomatic endeavours and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace .  
With the advent of the twenty-first century , we now face an historic choice as to what kind of a world we should bring to the new century .  The Chinese delegation holds that the international community should work to establish a just and rational new international political and economic order to ensure global and regional security .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Closely related to the follow-up to and implementation of the Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation of and follow up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels to the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
To reinforce understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided on a regional basis into groups , each of which studied a case history where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
It was the only State excluded from all the regional groups ; it was barred from the Economic and Social Council , whose work affected the lives of everyone in the world ; it was barred from contributing to the professional forums created by the United Nations ; and Israelis could be elected to United Nations bodies only in rare , ad personam elections not dependent on the regional group system , although even then , even world-renowned Israelis had a negligible chance of obtaining the necessary votes .  
Our expectations , in the wake of the cold war , for the establishment of international peace and security and social and economic prosperity for humanity have not yet been fulfilled , because of continued civil and regional wars .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training , in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse , which should include raising public awareness on the detrimental effects of drug abuse ;  
However , it is our opinion that in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain specific principles , namely , it must be balanced , comprehensive , non-discriminatory , and fully enhance the national , regional and international security of all States according to the rules of international law .  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Requests all concerned organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the regional commissions and other relevant international and multilateral institutions , to make , within their respective fields of competence , substantive contributions and proposals for further action as submissions to the preparatory process of the Conference ;  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
The informed assessment of these contemporary hazards , effective risk management , and the prevention of future disasters must begin at the present time and be fully incorporated into the ongoing commitments of economic growth and developmental planning - at the international , regional , and national levels of responsibility .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
Expected results in the thematic area of gender include : ( a ) four regional networks established and a common agenda developed ; ( b ) a programme implemented on violence against women , including the promotion of inter-agency activities , the creation of a directory of organizations and resources available , the production of messages and the promotion of national debates and support to organizations ; and ( c ) tools developed to monitor gender-mainstreaming , directories established best practices documented , and national surveys conducted on issues related to gender themes .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
The objectives in this thematic area are to equip the Arab societies with additional capacity to shield themselves , and especially their poor populations , from the avoidable costs of the globalization of trade and capital markets , and to benefit from these global processes as well as from regional and interregional economic cooperation and trade .  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
At the regional level , in support of subregional and national actions , the programme will explore innovative approaches to the interconnected issues of governance , gender and poverty and will advance the application of the human development index ( pioneered by the earlier phase of the regional programme ) to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the epidemic .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
The objectives of this project are to help to formulate sound human development policies through : ( a ) the preparation of national human development reports , combined with an annual regional human development report ; and ( b ) the development of improved statistics on human development indicators , including reports on social trends by countries , the latter in close cooperation with ECE . 13 .  Subregional workshops will bring together specialists responsible for national human development reports and from the national statistical offices .  
Expected results and successful criteria include : ( a ) functional gender-development units will have been established in each of the 27 countries participating in the regional programme ; ( b ) databases on national and regional gender-in-development activities will have been set up ; ( c ) networks will have been established between non-governmental organizations and gender-in-development units ; and ( d ) institutions involved in gender-related research and training will have been provided with results that may have an impact on national gender-related issues .  
While significance of national and regional characteristics and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Requests Governments , the specialized agencies , other international organizations , concerned United Nations bodies , regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and other human rights mechanisms to assist the preparatory committee , to undertake reviews and submit recommendations concerning the conference and the preparations therefor to the preparatory committee through the Secretary-General , and to participate actively in the conference ;  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
As outlined in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the report of the Secretary-General , adjustments would need to be made to the Mission 's staffing and regional deployment during the biennium 1998-1999 in order to strengthen its capacity to coordinate its work , attract and retain highly qualified staff , ensure an adequate geographical coverage of the country and address all the substantive areas of verification in compliance with its mandate and ensure adequate liaison with other international institutions and bodies .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of training , dissemination and information can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to provide adequate security for all special rapporteurs , and to live up to its pledge to provide logistical support to national , regional and international organizations to join the investigations of alleged cases of involuntary disappearance and slavery ;  
These included the provision of assistance , on a national or regional basis , in vertical and horizontal diversification as well as in related human capacities ; creation of self-financing mechanisms for commodity diversification activities ; and effectively addressing the weak technological base , market access problems and other commodity-related problems .  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .  
The Security Council welcomes the outcome of meetings between the Somali leaders held in Cairo concluded on 22 December 1997 , in particular their decision to adopt a federal system with regional autonomy and their agreement to form a transitional government of national unity and to hold an inclusive conference of national reconciliation in Baidoa through which a presidential council and a Prime Minister will be elected .  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
Requests the Executive Director to continue , within existing resources , to cooperate with the appropriate regional organizations and to provide policy advice and technical assistance , especially in capacity-building , to countries with economies in transition , tailored to each country 's respective economic and social needs in the field of housing and human settlements , and paying special attention , inter alia , to :  
Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,  
In addition , nearly 83,000 housing units for low-income families are to be built , environmental management plans are to be prepared for Guatemala City and the main urban centres in the country , a national plan for disaster prevention is to be elaborated , and urban development plans are to be formulated for Guatemala City and the regional capitals .  
In order to lay the foundations of this program and set it in motion , we should consider holding an international meeting with the participation of the relevant agencies of the system , regional organs and the respective national programmes of the countries concerned .  
Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of members of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past few years to contain the devastating effects of the conflicts in the Arab Gulf region , which has great importance to regional and international strategies , and their continuing endeavour to support progress towards joint reconstruction and cooperation , the unstable political and security conditions in the region remain a source of concern for us .  
It also requires building bridges for multilateral cooperation , at both the bilateral and the collective level , on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence , confidence-building , non-interference in the internal affairs of others , mutual respect for regional sovereignties and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means rather than the use of force , in accordance with the rules of international law and the Charters of both the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations .  
In seeking to enhance its participation in such regional and international institutions , the United Arab Emirates , thanks to the wise guidance of its Head of State , His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan , has achieved a qualitative and quantitative leap in the developmental , economic , social , environmental and human fields in the past two decades .  
That will be in line with our policy of continuing to hold a series of multifaceted regional and international conferences and exhibitions in the cultural , social , economic , political and environmental fields .  
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
He also affirmed that Iraq would reciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by taking two balanced steps : one corresponding to the Iranian step and another in line with our deep sense of humanitarian , regional and international responsibility to encourage the taking of successive , continual steps to ensure that regional security , mutual respect and balanced interests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a way that benefits the peoples of the region .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
The Sao Paulo Consensus adopted by the Conference renews the region \ x { e5b8 } commitment to give priority to the issues on the social agenda , to incorporate social equity into economic growth , to ensure the necessary allocation of resources to projects with a social impact , to strengthen cooperation with all sectors of civil society , to ensure an integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental dimensions of development and to establish a regional database of successful social projects , among other goals .  
Within this overall conceptual construct , the Summit resolved to create a framework for policy and action at the national , regional and international levels geared to the promotion of social progress , justice and the betterment of the human condition .  
However , national , regional and international efforts have not yet succeeded in transforming the social situation of today \ x { e5b8 } world , which is marked by major disparities in income and by the extreme poverty that affects the lives of billions of human beings .  
The Nicaragua Declaration , signed one and a half months ago , strengthened the process of regional integration and laid the foundation for a possible political unification of the Central American countries , and it further enhanced Central American social , economic and trade policy .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
Lessons learned from Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina prove that the existing international and regional organizations possess tools that are efficient for preventive and post-conflict engagement , on the condition that they are applied in a concerted , timely and proper manner .  
In that statement baseless and unsubstantiated allegations were made against some regional States , including my country , to divert the attention of the international community from the illegal policies and inhuman actions of Israel , such as the continued occupation of the territories of others , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
The operative part recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as a mechanism for coordinating and harmonizing regional efforts to achieve economic , social , cultural , environmental and political integration .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
In the international economic sphere , for example , regional integration needs to be built upon the spirit of mutual interdependence and transparency to prevent any attempt at establishing inward-looking arrangements , leading to closed trading blocs that could be misused as tools for protectionism .  
During the past three years we have made extraordinary progress in our integration efforts , which extend from a new conceptual horizon , one that has become better balanced and more inclusive with the creation of the Alliance for Sustainable Development and the establishment of innovative regional projects to increase regional competitiveness by means of joint efforts on the part of Governments , academic centres and sectors of production . 
We agreed on the broadest possible review and modernization of our regional institutional framework , as we were convinced that the benefits of development to which our people are entitled can not be tapped by each country separately they are attainable only to a regional community , because of the dynamics of today 's increasingly interdependent environment .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) and paragraphs 5 , 6 and 7 of the Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament proclaimed at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT established a sound legal foundation for creating new international nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of agreements freely entered into between the appropriate States for the purposes of strengthening peace and security on the global and regional levels .  
My delegation is convinced that internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones , established on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , are an effective instrument to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and confidence-building , and thereby help to enhance global and regional peace and security .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
This multifaceted process of sustainable development necessitates constant and close multilateral cooperation as well as concerted efforts on a regional and national basis .  
There has been a rapid expansion in both formal and informal regional arrangements , driven in part by concerns over the potential negative impacts of globalization on national economies and by the positive prospects of regionalization .  
In the face of the increasing power of private global actors to determine the distribution of income and production and the content of economic and social policies , outside the political process , it is important to broaden participation in decision-making and to strengthen political accountability by means of increased transparency of decision-making in existing regional and international institutions . 
They should have institutional arrangements that are flexible , democratic , transparent and responsive to changing global and regional conditions .  
Convinced further that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic and social fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of Headquarters and the subsidiary organs located in the developing regions ,  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;  
We believe the peace process in Guatemala has demonstrated that , even in the wake of severe civil conflict , peace and democracy are not unattainable goals so long as the parties concerned exhibit the necessary political will to make peace , and are supported in their efforts by their regional neighbours , the United Nations and the international community as a whole .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject related to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation .  
With the appointment of regional alternative development advisers posted in south and south-east Asia and Latin America and strengthened expertise in alternative development at headquarters , UNDCP has underlined its commitment to supporting alternative development as a viable tool for reducing illicit crop cultivation .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
In its continuing effort to promote and develop policies and programmes for older persons , the ESCAP secretariat is preparing a directory of national focal points on ageing in Asia and the Pacific ; a directory of non-governmental organizations active in dealing with older persons in the region ; and a bibliography of international and regional mandates and relevant documents concerning ageing and older persons .  
The aims and objectives of the national youth policy of Indonesia are : ( a ) to help foster Indonesia awareness , identity , solidarity and prosperity among youth ; ( b ) to promote policies and programmes relating to youth as an integral part of social and cultural values among the Asian and Pacific nations ; and ( c ) to realize the potential of youth as human resources in regional development .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
Evidence is strong that most of the increase is attributable to human activity , in particular , to fossil fuel combustion . 8 Continuation of these emission trends poses serious , though uncertain , risks of global and regional climate change , leading to unpredictable rises in sea level , inundation of low-lying coastal areas , migration of ecosystems and disruption of agriculture .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels . 
IAEA has developed a computer-based record-keeping system to assist in achieving effective control of sealed radiation sources , the Sealed Radiation Sources ( SRS ) registry , designed for use by national regulatory bodies and regional centres for tracking sources from the cradle to the grave . 
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
In its resolution 1996 / 64 of 23 April 1996 entitled " Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Asian and Pacific region " , the Commission on Human Rights reaffirmed that regional arrangements played a fundamental role in promoting and protecting human rights and that they should reinforce universal human rights standards , as contained in international human rights instruments .  
The Kathmandu workshop proved to be a crucial turning point when , for the first time in the series of meetings , it focused on regional arrangements , explored available options , identified specific steps as building-blocks , and concluded with a clear consensus in the form of agreed workshop conclusions .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
On balance the amount of progress achieved is discouraging : the interminable debates that take place in Parliament are repeated in CNE , as demonstrated by the two months required to elect its bureau and the failure to establish regional commissions ( that of Kinshasa was set up in August ) .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
The Sub-Commission considered that it would be useful for the Commission to establish , for a three _ year period , a Working Group composed of five experts nominated by Governments , to be appointed by the Chairman of the Commission at its fifty _ third session on the basis of equitable geographical representation and in consultation with the regional groups in the Commission , with the following mandate :  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to examine and review conditions in each Territory so as to take appropriate measures to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of the Territories and strengthen existing measures of support , and , in that regard , to formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
On the basis of both kinds of information , the Commission might then consider devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and in practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels .  
To clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger , as stated in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international and regional instruments , and to give particular attention to implementation and full and progressive realization of this right as a means of achieving food security for all .  
Close to 40 formal case-studies were commissioned and three very successful international workshops were held , with financial support mobilized from a wide variety of sources : a regional workshop for Africa ( Dakar , June 1995 ) ; an international workshop for Asia and other regions ( Madras , February 1996 ) ; and a global meeting during the Habitat II .

While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
Also requests the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization to extend appropriate assistance to Governments in designing and setting up programmes to encourage the creative , artistic and intellectual potential of children with disabilities , and through its regional offices , to conduct seminars and workshops to provide appropriate training in those fields to teachers , parents , social workers and others concerned ;  
Noting especially that in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;

Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Governments , national , regional and international bodies , bilateral and multilateral donors and civil society , including non-governmental organizations , should continue to make special efforts to reduce the female illiteracy rate to at least half its 1990 level , with emphasis on rural , migrant and refugee women , internally displaced women and women with disabilities , in keeping with the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Recalling its resolution 1996 / 11 of 11 April 1996 and reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which stated the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .

Successful efforts at the regional level demonstrate the feasibility of this undertaking and constitute proof of the ability of the international community to arrive at common concepts and to devise generally acceptable methods and strategies that would form the basis of improved and effective international cooperation .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
The Government of Croatia will look to cooperate with the international community in finding a proper way to harmonize the complex matrix of sometime conflicting interests of the two groups , while focusing its efforts on protecting civil liberties , human and minority rights , as well as maintaining internal security and regional peace and stability .

With regard to diplomatic protection by international organizations , her delegation believed that since the number of international , regional and governmental organizations had grown immensely in the past decade , the functional diplomatic protection of those organizations formed an important part of contemporary diplomatic protection .  
Cognizant of the importance of maintaining the momentum already generated at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of measures designed to address the economic , social and environmental consequences of rapid urbanization ,  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Requests the United Nations Industrial Development Organization , the Economic Commission for Africa and other relevant United Nations organizations , in accordance with their agreed mandates , work programmes and priorities , to work closely with Governments and the private sector in Africa at the national , regional and international levels to foster industrial production and development ;  
When ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to the present Convention , or at any time thereafter , a Party which is not a regional economic integration organization may declare in a written instrument submitted to the Depositary that , in respect of any dispute not resolved in accordance with paragraph 2 , it recognizes as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement in relation to any Party accepting the same obligation :  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
Recalling its resolution 1996 / 11 of 11 April 1996 and reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which stated the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
Reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated , that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Takes into account the Bangkok Declaration wherein it is recognized that while human rights are universal in nature , they must be considered in the context of a dynamic and evolving process of international norm _ setting , bearing in mind the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds ;  
The creation of wider markets through regional and subregional economic integration remains a fundamental prerequisite for a viable economic diversification strategy in Africa , if only to make up for the small size of domestic markets and to encourage the restructuring of national production systems to take advantage of complementarities in resource endowments and economies of scale .  
Recalling also that regional and , as appropriate , national human rights institutions , as well as non _ governmental organizations , may present their views to the Secretary _ General on the progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , and that special attention should be paid to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations ,  
Emphasizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ; the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ; while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly , early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
There are , however , signs that the successful implementation of this operation is threatened , primarily because the separatist leadership opposes their return , as is the phased restoration of the natural regional demographics which would be an inevitable consequence of an expanded peacekeeping mandate .  
The current issues are concerned with choices between a cost-plus regime ( typified by many United States utilities ) or a price cap ( typified by the RPI-X formula started in the United Kingdom ) ; between a single regulator , a regulatory board , or sectoral regulatory agencies ; whether to break up a national monopoly into regional monopolies ; the rate at which competitors should be licensed , bearing in mind the need for the incumbent enterprise to finance major expansion as far as possible from internally generated surpluses ; etc .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
Other objectives include the provision of timely and authoritative information by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General to media representatives , the provision of timely and adaptable information materials through the United Nations information centres to meet regional and local needs , the establishment of an international broadcasting system and monitoring of international trends and events as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the Organization and the Secretary-General by major media networks .  
The first of the above problems has not yet been solved with the help of international machinery and procedures but could be if criteria , recognized at the global or regional level , for defining gross and massive violations of human rights were developed .  
Ten workshops : two annual regional workshops in Asia and the Pacific , for government representatives to discuss human rights issues that require a regional approach and initiatives , such as the establishment of regional arrangements for the protection and promotion of human rights ; two regional training courses in Africa and Asia on economic , social and cultural rights ; two specialized regional training courses in Latin America and Africa for trainers ; and two national training courses for lawyers and judges ; ( iii ) Fellowships .  
In 1998-1999 , ESCWA will continue to enhance regional cooperation and policy coordination and increase awareness of the economic , social , cultural , technological and environmental dimensions of development , promoting the development of technical assistance activities and projects commensurate with the needs and priorities of ESCWA member States .  
In addition , the mechanism of nuclear _ free zones has established an entire system of agreements which also provide , in a regional context , of course , for assurances set forth in specific legal instruments .  
In paragraphs 45 to 47 of my report of 7 February 1997 ( S / 1997 / 115 ) , I described in detail the challenges that would be faced by the administrative component of the follow-on mission , as logistical support would have to be provided to headquarters of the follow-on mission in Luanda , to the political , police , human rights and military components in six regional headquarters , and to almost all provincial capitals and over 30 other outstations .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in the protection and improvement of the environment , the prevention of transboundary pollution , the rational and resource-conserving utilization of the natural environment , the elimination of the consequences of natural and technogenic emergencies and shall promote coordinated action in this area at the regional and global levels with a view to creating a comprehensive system of international environmental safety .  
The promotion of joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , leading to a more integrated approach that incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development , also needs to be encouraged .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
Closely related to the follow-up and implementation of this Agenda is the urgent need for an integrated , interrelated and coherent implementation and follow-up at the national , subregional , regional , and international levels of the recommendations and commitments of recent United Nations major conferences and agreements on development .  
The integrated follow-up on United Nations conferences provided an opportunity to coordinate United Nations activities at three levels , i.e . , at global level , through the Administrative Committee on Coordination ( ACC ) and its inter-agency task forces ; at regional level , through regional meetings of agencies members of ACC , chaired by the Executive Secretaries of the regional economic commissions ; and at country level , through task forces operating within the resident coordinator system .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
In the area of reproductive health and family planning , the Population Division of ESCAP has initiated a regional project to strengthen monitoring and information systems to provide accurate and timely indicators and has been assisting Governments in developing and strengthening policies for involving the elderly in social and economic development .  
The Committee was concerned that within the framework of economic and structural changes , including those arising from regional and international economic arrangements , insufficient attention had been paid to their impact on women in general and on disadvantaged women in particular .  
Shall we simply say that we engaged in endless debate , encompassing plenary meetings , informal plenary meetings , open _ ended consultations , and meetings of regional and political groups and other impromptu gatherings too numerous to mention ? 
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
Emphasizing the encouraging results of the regional and national training activities established by UNESCO , in cooperation with the national and international institutions concerned , to improve the implementation of the 1970 Convention on illicit traffic in cultural property ,  
The SRCF will be used for : ( i ) financing assistance to governments and regional / subregional bodies in the national , subregional and regional action programming ; ( ii ) financing assistance for the preparation of local area development programmes ( LADPs ) that respond to National Action Programmes , bearing in mind also the dual track approach for LADPs and NAPs that some countries might envisage ; and ( iii ) catalytic financing for National Desertification Funds , designed within the context of National Action Programmes . 22 .  Finance for civil society .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) ;  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
Aware and convinced that the survival of humanity is a collective responsibility , we decided in Rio to establish a new kind of partnership built of common yet differentiated responsibility in order to promote national , regional and world cooperation for development that we wished to be sustainable .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Political events worldwide have shown that war , national and regional conflicts , occupation , the imposition of fait accompli policies and the denial of the legitimate rights of peoples under occupation have an adverse impact not only on peace and security in a region but on economic , social and environmental development .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
As the illicit traffic in and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are serious and growing concerns in the region , the development of an accurate annual estimate of the situation and trends is essential to the successful development and implementation of regional strategies and subregional programmes .  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
Observers presented examples of cases where , in their opinion , persons belonging to minorities were unable to participate effectively in cultural , religious , social , economic and public life and where their participation in decision _ making at the national and regional levels was limited .  
Ms . Estebanez said that the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe had established undertakings on the part of States aimed at the protection of the languages of historical or regional minorities in Europe , through comprehensive treatment of linguistic minority issues in the areas of : education ; the use of minority languages in dealings with the administrative authorities and public services and in administrative proceedings ; cultural activities ; economic and social life ; and trans-border contacts .  
The consultations had provided an opportunity for agencies to present their activities and to discuss possible cooperation on , for example : joint input to the Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission and the Working Group , the provision of relevant information to be included on a website page , joint minority-related technical cooperation projects , submission of information on system-wide complaints procedures , input into the treaty bodies , dissemination of the recommendations and resolutions of supervisory bodies , and the provision of training on minority-related human rights instruments at regional and national levels .

In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Given the serious consequences of the problem as described above , this is a promising time to analyse the small arms and light weapons in use in recent conflicts , the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer , as well as to recommend to Member States , regional organizations and the international community as a whole , particularly as represented by the United Nations , practical measures to prevent and reduce the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of such weapons , with a view to diminishing their role in exacerbating conflicts .  
The States members of the League of Arab States fully support the cause of transparency in armaments as a means for enhancing international peace and security and believe that , in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain basic principles : it must be balanced , comprehensive and non-discriminatory , and it must enhance the national , regional and international security of all States in conformity with international law . 
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
We call upon donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank , the African Development Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to give favourable consideration to project proposals on strengthening our national or regional capacities and creating the expertise required for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime and corruption , elaborated by the Division and submitted to them .  
We regard the project proposals that we have reviewed ( reflected in annex III of the report of the Regional Ministerial Workshop ) as viable and important regional initiatives , containing the basic elements of a concerted approach to the problems faced by all States of the region in the prevention and control of organized transnational crime , money-laundering and corruption .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
She welcomed the efforts made by the United Nations Statistical Commission to develop a minimum national social data set , disaggregated by gender , as a guide for national statistical services in monitoring the implementation of the outcomes of recent United Nations conferences , and encouraged the Commission to consider adopting the minimum data set , together with the recommendations , so that the regional commissions could conduct pilot studies in each region on the availability and quality of the required statistics .  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
The States of the Rio Group had reaffirmed that an integrated strategy to combat drugs should take into account the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon ; it was thus essential to implement social and regional development and substitution programmes designed to improve the living conditions of the rural families concerned . 
Over the preceding 10 years , the international community had established legal standards and created an institutional framework for regional and international cooperation in the struggle against illegal drugs , which would be greatly reinforced by universal ratification of the international treaties , the adaptation of domestic legislation and the implementation of the relevant programmes .  
One important task of the United Nations was that of providing States , Governments , non-governmental organizations and representatives of public organizations with better information with a view to seeking solutions to urgent problems encountered by most of the world 's countries , promoting international assistance and implementing specific economic and social programmes and projects at the national , regional and international levels . 
The Committee had proposed that at its 1997 session the advisory committee should finalize the agenda and work out the organizational aspects of the special session and a schedule of events , as well as outlining the desirable form of participation of relevant international , regional and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in the preparatory work .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .

The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
Information received from a number of regional institutions indicate , however , that they are still unable to meet the technical assistance needs of small island developing States in their respective regions on account of a number of constraints , which are briefly outlined in section III below .  
In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .  
Such treatments shall be applied in a determined scale to intermediate developed countries , and in a more favourable manner to countries at a relatively less advanced stage of economic development ; and ( e ) Multiple , to make possible various forms of agreements between member countries , following the objectives and duties of the integration process , using all instruments capable of activating and expanding markets at regional level .

The elements needed for good governance in the fisheries sector are well recognized : the need for a strategy explicitly aimed at ecological , economic and social sustainability ; effective fisheries agencies and research institutions ; a cooperative , organized and informed fisheries sector ; adequate laws and legal institutions , including deterrent monitoring , control and surveillance ; and appropriate linkages with regional and international bodies .  
And as FAO has noted , the complex array of internal and external pressures acting on the fisheries sector call for responsible , timely , coordinated and comprehensive responses by national fishery administrations and regional fishery bodies if governance is to be strengthened .  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session in 1997 , urged Governments to consider the positive and negative impact of subsidies on the conservation and management of fisheries through national , regional and appropriate international organizations , and based on those analyses to consider appropriate action .  
To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .

As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
For the forest sector to become relatively more effective and influential and attract more resources , international and regional institutions and bilateral donors with coordination units at the national level would have to be engaged .

UNIDO , with its capacity to carry out objective and independent studies of the global , regional , national and sectoral issues that affected industrial development , could provide the developing countries with valuable sources of information and advice in that area .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
Its specific objective was to assist Member States within that region to formulate recommendations and action plans for , inter alia , ( a ) enhancing Member States ' understanding of the role and use of space technology in social and economic development ; ( b ) addressing problems associated with implementing space technology and space-application programmes ; and ( c ) improving and facilitating regional and international collaboration efforts .  
Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed training , dissemination and information programmes can have a catalytic effect on national , regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations ,  
UNDP is providing support to emerging governance and administrative structures at the highest possible level ( community , district , or regional ) for economic and social rehabilitation and reintegration in both rural and urban settings .  
At regional higher educational establishments which , like Jalal _ Abad University , were set up simply by combining a number of technical secondary schools and without the requisite teaching materials , equipment , premises or qualified teaching staff , the quality of instruction is poor .  
Recalling the importance of regional stability and the need to consolidate the progress achieved so far , and in particular to assist the people of the Central African Republic to consolidate the process of national reconciliation taking into account the need to maintain a secure and stable environment conducive to the economic recovery and to the holding of free and fair presidential elections ,  
Recalling the importance of regional stability and the need to consolidate the progress achieved so far , and in particular to assist the people of the Central African Republic to consolidate the process of national reconciliation taking into account the need to maintain a secure and stable environment conducive to the economic recovery and to the holding of free and fair presidential elections ,

The activities undertaken to mark the anniversary by Governments , international and regional organizations and , most notably , by civil society at all levels - local , national , regional and international _ have also provided clear evidence of a reinvigorated commitment to human rights as the common principles which should unite the international community as a new century begins . 
The purpose of the OHCHR technical cooperation programme is to assist countries - including Governments and civil society - in promoting and protecting all human rights at the national and regional levels , through the incorporation of international human rights standards in national laws , policies and practices , and building a sustainable national capacity to implement these standards and ensure respect for human rights .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
Even the initial analysis of the recommendations and proposals made by several United Nations bodies and mechanisms active in the field of human rights makes it possible to single out a number of major themes that could be considered by the World Conference with a view to formulating recommendations for the adoption of additional measures to combat racism at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Peruvian Government , for its part , considered that the World Conference should formulate concrete recommendations making it possible to increase the effectiveness of existing machinery used to combat racial discrimination and to adopt additional measures at the national , regional and international levels to strengthen those already in place .  
His Government , which had also received assistance from the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) and the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , considered that regional and subregional organizations minimized the escalation of conflicts and strengthened the rapid deployment mechanism of the United Nations ; for that reason , it strongly supported the initiative to strengthen cooperation with those organizations .  
At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Solving that global problem , which affected adoptive parents abroad as well as the institutions and legal systems of the babies countries of origin , required adopting the Special Rapporteurs recommendation that international and regional registers of adopted children should be established worldwide .  
Reaffirm that the central decision _ making role in determining the content of the regional technical cooperation programme , evaluating the progress achieved and determining actions to be taken under the programme in the future will continue to be played by the annual intergovernmental workshop with the assistance of the open-ended team in Geneva comprising Geneva _ based representatives of the Governments of the Asian-Pacific region ;  
It would require the support of the international community in order , inter alia to promote full employment as a basic priority of economic and social policies and to encourage the formulation of policies and strategies , at the national and regional level , that would meet the basic needs of the people , strengthen their productive capacities and empower them to participate in decision-making .

Some delegations expressed continued support for improving the operation of GESAMP , while noting at the same time that regional approaches were most practical for improving access to sound scientific understanding .  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Mr . Erds ( Hungary ) said that Hungary firmly believed that , for the scourge of terrorism to be successfully suppressed , there must be no safe havens for terrorists , and that objective could only be achieved through the establishment of a global system based on a unified international approach and effective regional cooperation .  
Her delegation strongly condemned all acts , methods and practice of terrorism regardless of who committed them and for what purpose , because they targeted the lives and property of innocent people , violated basic human rights and posed a serious threat to regional and international peace and security .  
UNESCO welcomed the ongoing discussions on the feasibility of establishing a United Nations radio network and it looked forward to being able to participate in programming and to working with Member States to promote cultural diversity , including linguistic diversity , through communication through the development of endogenous media capacities , particularly radio broadcasting at the community , national and regional levels .

A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
Attempts to apply a different standard to international law and to disregard its basic norms and principles create a dangerous precedent that could cause acute destabilization and chaos on the regional and global level .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
The Sub-Committee , while respecting the principles set out in article 3 , is encouraged to cooperate for the prevention of torture in general with the relevant United Nations organs and mechanisms as well as international , regional and national institutions or organizations working towards strengthening the protection of persons from torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .

Given the vast territory of Angola and the deployment of MONUA at Luanda , six regional headquarters and 18 provincial offices , these aircraft provided air support for the transport of military and civilian personnel , medium and heavy cargo from the Viana logistics base throughout the mission area and for medical and casualty evacuation purposes .  
However , with growth of output in Africa projected to slow to about 2 per cent in 1999 below the level of population growth this modest recovery is already being threatened by international financial crises , declining commodity prices and regional conflicts .  
Taking into account the growing spread of poverty and its highly negative social and political dimensions , the special session may wish to consider what kind of national , regional and international measures can be recommended in order to reverse the negative trends .

National and bilateral TCDC activities during the reporting period clearly indicate that an increasing number of developing countries are emerging as key proponents of the TCDC process , assuming leadership roles in promoting , organizing and funding bilateral and regional TCDC-related projects as part of their annual commitment to trade , investment and international cooperation activities .  
The extensive policy and substantive exchanges that took place on such issues as regional and subregional trade arrangements , " growth triangles " and special economic and free-trade zones led to the adoption of the Bali Declaration and a Plan of Action on this urgent , complex subject .  
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres . 
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;

the same emphasis , and that , while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Recalling that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad _ based dialogue involving all concerned actors ,  
They are guaranteed the right to establish and use their own mass media , cultural , educational , language and religious institutions , and to establish and foster unhindered relations and maintain peaceful contacts with co-nationals outside the Yugoslav borders , as well as the right to participate at the national , regional and local levels .  
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .

Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
Calls upon the regional preparatory meetings to present to the Preparatory Committee , through the High Commissioner , reports on the results of their deliberations , with concrete and pragmatic recommendations aimed at combating racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , which will be duly reflected in the texts of the draft final documents of the World Conference to be prepared by the Committee ;  
Other areas of UNICEF action include increasing internal and external resources to water and environmental sanitation programmes at the country and regional level , advocating the commitment of higher resources to the sector , promoting subregional collaboration among countries and working to help reach the un-served by expanding coverage through participatory community-based approaches and supporting innovative financing mechanisms for sustainability and equity .  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
Under the overall objective of assisting developing countries to address emerging challenges and persistent problems , the objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to conduct development policy analysis , particularly in the examination of changes in domestic economic conditions and of regional and international developments that have a bearing on them .  
Enhance the capacity of institutions in developing countries to formulate development strategies by strengthening their ability to monitor national subregional , regional and international macroeconomic trends and incorporate them into the national framework for economic and social policy-making ;  
This will reinforce existing South / South networks and create opportunities for experts to learn from rapid substantive and technological changes in the field of statistics ; strengthen regional capability to produce analytical reports ; improve the ability of national institutions to produce relevant statistics ; and ensure capability to share information and results .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
With the rapid accumulation of satellite technology and the resulting expansion in Koreas space programme , a wide range of international cooperative activities are being implemented by the Republic of Korea and other countries at the regional and global levels .  
Although globalization is driving the current economic and sociological evolution of the industrialized world , regional cultural identity still represents an extraordinarily strong force in the world .  
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
In reviewing items 8 ( a ) - ( c ) , special attention will be paid to the scientific and technological developments that have taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular developing countries , with regard to global , regional and national issues .  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .  
Despite the cross _ regional support for such a mechanism , despite the assurances that its deliberations on nuclear disarmament would not impinge on the bilateral nuclear disarmament process , despite the safeguards provided by the rule of consensus in the CD and despite a continual lowering of ambitions in relation to the scope of work on nuclear disarmament , a consensus has not so far proved attainable .  
In the same resolution , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stressed that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions .  
Thirdly , the adoption of a renewed Strategic Concept by a regional military alliance _ despite the declared end of the cold war _ is bound to generate considerable concern in the wide spectrum of nuclear and non _ nuclear States .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
International and regional conferences and meetings , in particular the twelfth World AIDS Conference , held in Geneva in June 1998 , provided an effective forum for drawing global attention to the major gaps in action on the epidemic and to the very significant role that young people can play in shaping the global response .  
Proceeding from these ideas , it is assumed that a democratic society requires the existence and free exercise of certain basic individual and group rights and freedoms , which the Universal Declaration and the International Covenants - not to mention at this juncture other international , regional and national human rights instruments , norms and standards - define and thereby indicate their limits .  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
In the area of poverty alleviation , special emphasis was given to assisting Governments in enhancing the quality of life of the poor and other disadvantaged and vulnerable social groups , including children , youth , older persons and disabled persons , through the provision of policy-oriented research and guidelines and the convening of intergovernmental meetings aimed at forging agreements on priority issues , policy approaches and regional benchmarks and their monitoring .  
Like previous regional urban forums , the Third Forum would include representatives of national and local governments , private sector businesses , civil society organizations , including NGOs , academic and training institutes , and the media .  
ESCWAs mainstream activities in the population , social and women-related areas are being linked with the programmed activities outlined in a three-year extrabudgetary flagship project on integrated follow-up to global conferences , which was formulated by ESCWA and supported by UNDP to forge a regional link for Arab States between the global vision and national endeavours to pursue the recommendations of global conferences . 
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damages sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
In this statement , ACC underscored that the concept of sustainable development provided an over-arching policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations system-wide activities at the global , regional and country levels ( para . 2 ) , and called for the implementation of interrelated policies promoting economic development , improved social equity and environmental sustainability .  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
Subsequently , the General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 192 , paragraph 41 , stressed the growing need for incorporating the regional and subregional dimension in United Nations operational activities for development , and encouraged resident coordinators , in close consultation with Governments , to secure greater involvement of the regional commissions , taking into account their agreed mandates and work programmes , in UNDAF , as appropriate .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
As indicated above , this important dimension of the work of the regional commissions as part of their respective regional institutional landscape was acknowledged and endorsed by the Council in its resolution 1998 / 46 , annex III , paragraph 12 , in which the Council encouraged the regional commissions to intensify their cooperation and regular exchange of information as determined by their respective intergovernmental bodies , with relevant regional bodies , institutions and networks .  
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
The Tokyo Agenda for Action , adopted by the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development , held in October 1998 , also established a number of priorities based on widespread consultation among African and Asian Governments and the private sector , donor countries and international and regional organizations in a series of preparatory activities prior to the Conference . 
While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems , to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ( author 's emphasis ) . 
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
Based on the Empretec model , it operates as a regional network and also as a focal point for coordinating existing and new initiatives sponsored by UNDP , other donor agencies , Governments and NGOs aimed at accelerating the growth , expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in Africa and improving the quality of indigenous African entrepreneurship .  
Forms of participation by resident non-citizens should also be developed , including local voting rights after a certain period of residence and inclusion of elected non-citizen observers in municipal , regional and national legislative and decision-making assemblies ;  
Governments at local , regional and national levels should recognize the role of multiple identities in contributing to open communities and in establishing useful distinctions between public institutional structures and cultural identities ;  
We note that countries in the region participating in the Stability Pact commit themselves to continued democratic and economic reforms , as well as bilateral and regional cooperation among themselves to advance their integration , on an individual basis , into Euro-Atlantic structures .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .

Strengthening and supporting the activities of the regional centres , established at the initiative of the United Nations pursuant to General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , calls for concerted effort by various agencies with a view to sustaining , inter alia , their educational activities , infrastructure development and the institutional and organizational framework .  
With this in mind , educational and training activities should be strengthened and supported by bilateral and multilateral programmes adapted to domestic needs , which should also consider the strenghthening of such as the regional training centres for space science and technology education established with the assistance of the United Nations .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
To take note of the recommendations of the regional preparatory conferences for Africa and the Middle East , for Asia and the Pacific , for eastern Europe and for Latin America and the Caribbean that are relevant to efforts made at the global and regional levels , as set forth in sections A and B , respectively , of the annex to the present Declaration , and to call upon the international community , to the extent feasible , to consider those recommendations in appropriate forums ;  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .  
With regard to the implementation of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 36 , para . 15 ) about the persistent regional disparities between the Atlantic and Central / Pacific regions , the growing disparities between urban and rural areas as well as the increasing number of people living in urban poor and marginalized areas .

The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
Ensure that United Nations missions aimed at peace-making , peacekeeping and peace-building include a mass media component that can disseminate information about international humanitarian law and human rights law , including peace education and children 's protection , while also giving objective information about the activities of the United Nations , and encourage authorized regional missions to include such a capacity .

It has also contributed actively to a number of international and regional funds established to promote economic and social development in various countries of the world , including the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development , the Islamic Development Bank and other financial and economic institutions established for that purpose , and which the State of Kuwait is diligently supporting so that they can achieve the noble , humanitarian aims for which they were established . 
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
Three projects were undertaken by a central or local government responsible for gender matters , while the remaining are being implemented by local , national , regional , or international non-governmental organizations .

Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
In addition , the Office has developed a specific anti-trafficking programme whose objective is to work towards the integration of human rights into international , regional and national anti-trafficking initiatives , with emphasis on legal and policy development .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
The conference will provide an ideal opportunity for a cooperative partnership to be established among Governments , international and regional organizations and the non-governmental community to mobilize public and political support to address the problems associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
With respect to the latter , the last workshop , held in February this year in New Delhi , recommended that an inter-sessional regional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights and on steps to be taken in this regard at the national and international levels be organized .

The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
In that context , they outlined their respective measures to formulate national development strategies , action plans and policies , and to strengthen regulatory frameworks ; establish or strengthen national institutions to coordinate implementation of the Programme of Action at the national level ; and establish or strengthen regional institutions for effective regional coordination .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;

According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .

During the past year , the priorities of ALIDES have been advanced through a wide range of initiatives and meetings at various levels of government , encompassing the social sector , public finance and economic growth , environmental protection and sustainable development , and the strengthening of SICA and other regional institutions as a means of pursuing the goals of ALIDES .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
The profile should contain data on non-governmental organization participation such as geographical distribution : national , regional , international ; functional specialization ; size ; duration of existence and so on , as part of a system of frequent data gathering about non-governmental organization activities and their level of cooperation with the United Nations .  
Regional economic and social commissions should become better skilled at developing non-governmental organization relations at the regional and national levels , with a view to constructing policy and operational partnerships at those levels in implementing United Nations decisions and programmes as well as outcomes of international conferences ;  
We in Saint Lucia strongly support the continued participation of these Territories in regional institutions as a natural function of our ongoing Caribbean integration process , and as a critical component of the economic , social and constitutional development of the Caribbean .  
Member States and non-governmental organizations were invited to contribute to the proposed database of good practices and lessons learned on all forms of violence against women , information on bilateral and multilateral agreements , national experiences and lessons learned , initiatives and projects that had proved viable and effective in evolving national strategies and strengthening bilateral , regional and international cooperation for dealing with violence against women migrant workers . 
The formation of capital at the regional level maintained the same growth pattern ( 11 per cent in 1998 , compared to 10 per cent in 1997 ) , mainly owing to private investment , but also because of an increase in public investment in productive and social infrastructure , principally in El Salvador and Guatemala . .  
Across the region , there are indications of a growing gap in human development between zones of relative affluence in the capitals and principal cities and the extreme poverty of marginalized rural and urban areas .  There are related patterns of social inequality and exclusion between social groups , reflected in regional data on distribution of income and access to employment , health and education .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
Within this food and nutritional security plan , PAHO / WHO is promoting mechanisms to ensure the enforcement of existing legislation , as well as the technical norms of the World Trade Organization with respect to food quality , processing , biological , toxicological and nutritional protection and standards for industrial food products .  Agreements have been made with respect to the standardization of laws and support from regional ( i.e .  
A panel of technical experts held during the Consultative Group Meeting , which included representatives from UNICEF and other United Nations organizations , suggested that reducing ecological and social vulnerability to natural hazard is a core regional development issue and that the primary responsibility for reducing vulnerability lies with sectoral institutions and with local communities . 
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
Such questions will need to be addressed as an integral part of the effort to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to identify and promote the key elements of a better global understanding , bring all stakeholders into the developed dialogue and promote a far-reaching consensus on the actions and policies to be pursued at the national , regional and global levels .  
For combating such negative phenomena as drugs , organized crime and money-laundering , strengthened international cooperation by combining national efforts , the adoption of multilateral norms and international codes of conduct , as appropriate , and the development of multilateral regional or subregional cooperation , wherever suitable , are obvious areas requiring ongoing United Nations initiatives and action .

My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .

Moreover , Mexico has promoted the initiatives included in resolution 53 / 77 Y at both the regional and international levels , especially those intended to underline the extreme urgency of initiating negotiations on nuclear disarmament and the adoption of a consistent action programme that will lead us to a world free of nuclear weapons .  
The executive bodies of the various nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties constitute concrete examples of existing regional arrangements , but their capabilities need to be augmented and their political role needs to be acknowledged by the international community .  
This common approach both preventive and reactive is comprised of multiple and coordinated international , regional and national efforts that contribute to sustainable peace in areas prone or affected by conflict .  
The Department for Disarmament Affairs has continued consultations with international and regional organizations receiving reporting on military expenditures and has received their views and comments on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General ( A / 53 / 218 ) deriving from the consultations held on 23 April 1998 .  
Because worldwide economic problems pose a challenge to the social development efforts of individual countries , these issues should be approached in an integrated manner that involves national Governments , regional and multilateral organizations and relevant market actors .  
One important and urgent challenge for the United Nations is that of including , as part of its activities in the economic , social and financial fields , the in-depth consideration of issues such as financial crisis prevention and management , issues pertaining to financing for development , the rules of access to multilateral resources and the role of regional institutions , while respecting the areas in which national autonomy must be preserved .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .  
All international disputes and regional conflicts should be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through peaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of equality , rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of force based on the power of military superiority .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .  
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme and other relevant international and regional organizations : ( i ) to promote the participation of target groups in the design of projects and facilitate the sharing of information on best strategies ; and ( ii ) to facilitate the creation of an international network promoting regular contact among youth involved in demand reduction activities and allowing them to stay informed and learn from one another .  
These are reflected in initiatives undertaken by UNIDO for the planned subregional forums and the upgrading of certain national UNIDO country offices to regional offices , with a view to developing regional integrated programmes to address the special economic problems of the affected countries .  
By paying attention to the needs for a concerted action of the international community to address the regional dimensions of the root causes of conflict , the chapter calls for a coordinated regional approach that should be based on a set of agreed principles .  
To this end the Special Rapporteur welcomes the newly-created Stability Pact of the European Union for south-eastern Europe , which outlines a comprehensive approach to the region and promises the States of south-eastern Europe international assistance and eventual integration into European political and economic structures in return for ongoing progress towards democracy , respect for human rights , and regional cooperation .

The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
The group is helping to prepare case studies in rural and urban areas on the linkages between ecological factors , disaster preparedness and the level of damage sustained by natural phenomena , as well as to formulate regional projects for presentation to the international community .  
That support has been consistently reflected in Indonesias support of Africas objectives ; through our active participation in many international and regional forums , including our participation in various peacekeeping operations and South-South cooperation ; and also through the strong bilateral relations that Indonesia maintains throughout the continent .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security .

Expressing its grave concern about the continuation of the military confrontation in Afghanistan , threatening regional peace and security and causing massive loss of life and extensive human suffering , further destruction of property , serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure , refugee flows and other forcible displacements of large numbers of people ,  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
Based on the many discussions I have had with the parties and others concerned , it is my understanding that the existing areas of United Nations activity in the Middle East , from assistance to refugees and regional development activities to peacekeeping missions , as well as some additional areas of activity , are likely to be raised by the parties themselves in the forthcoming rounds of negotiations .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;

The development process requires a certain degree of political stability , peace and security at the national , regional and international levels , as well as the establishment of fair and equitable economic relations between States and solid international cooperation , aimed , inter alia , at helping the poorer States to boost their economies and give effect to the right to development .  
Recalling further that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad-based dialogue involving all concerned actors .  
Recalling further that the United Nations continues to play its central and impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the Afghan conflict , and encouraging all efforts at the national , regional and international levels aimed at finding a solution to the continuing conflict through a broad-based dialogue involving all concerned actors ,  
The diversity of national and regional paths of change , leading to a significant variety of post-socialist emerging capitalisms ( Magnin , 1999 ) , illustrates the role of idiosyncratic and evolving institutional configurations that represent the very content of systemic change .  
Underlines the importance that sovereign risk assessments be based on objective and transparent parameters , and in this regard invites the relevant national , regional and international regulatory bodies to contribute to the development of appropriate standards to ensure that risk-assessment agencies provide complete and accurate information on a timely and regular basis ;  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;

Likewise , on the future of the regional bureaux , I am convinced of the need for strong regional representation at the level of Assistant Secretary-General in New York and I intend to select and recommend to the Secretary-General senior figures to fill the posts that are currently vacant .  
The Executive Committee will assume a more active oversight role of UNDP activities in a select number of key crisis situations ; in these countries , corporate policy will be jointly designed by the regional bureau concerned and ERD with regular feedback to the Executive Committee .  
Russia was firmly convinced that the successful development of international cooperation in space on a regional and bilateral basis and its establishment on a long-term legal foundation were no substitute for the progressive development and modification of universal norms and principles of such cooperation .  
On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
The Mexican Government , which accorded high priority to promoting the full participation of women in social , economic , political and cultural life on a par with men , devoted significant resources to programmes designed to eliminate poverty using a gender-specific perspective , and to training women in non-traditional activities ; it was also encouraging independent employment and the creation of microbusinesses , in view of regional , social and gender realities .  
Every effort will be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter . However , peacekeeping will be one of the key instruments available to the United Nations to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security .  
Along with an explanation of the global framework and its regional organizational arrangement , the report will include concise methodological notes on how each regional comparison was aggregated and how the comparisons were brought together within a consistent and readily comparable framework .  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
It was therefore important to reinforce regional and international cooperation in combating drugs and essential to assist developing countries whether drug producing or otherwise in the administrative , judicial , economic and social areas , among other things by sharing information on investigation techniques , crop substitution , detoxification and reintegration of drug addicts into society .  
In resolution 54 / 93 , the General Assembly invited Governments and relevant organizations , in particular UNICEF , as well as regional and subregional organizations , to undertake reviews of progress achieved since the World Summit for Children and encouraged appropriate national , regional and international preparatory activities with a view to contributing to the preparations for the special session and building partnerships for and with children .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
It was further agreed that , to advance the work of the Council on the draft regulations , the Secretary-General would consult with the incoming President of the Council and with the regional groups and interest groups with a view to identifying the main areas of difficulty in the current draft and the most efficient working method which would enable the outstanding issues to be resolved .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
With respect to procurement by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals in excess of $ 50 , 000 but less than $ 200 , 000 ( or the specifically delegated monetary procurement limit , if it is less ) , any such procurement action must first be submitted to the applicable local Committee on Contracts for advice to , and , if satisfactory , approval by , the Chief Administrative Officer , the Chief of Administration or other applicable head of office .  
The note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45-72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
The Office is increasing its efforts to meet all outstanding requests for assistance from individual countries and new institutions , and seeking to increase effective coordination with other international agencies and regional and international organizations of national institutions in order to ensure that there is no duplication of effort .  
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
At the regional and subregional levels , the Office is undertaking a number of initiatives , including a joint project with the Council of Europe focusing on preventive activities for Central and Eastern Europe ; a range of activities in the former Yugoslavia coordinated by the human rights office in Sarajevo ; and a joint project with UNDP in Nepal focusing on the legal and judicial aspects of controlling trafficking .  
The proposed resources reflect a net growth of $ 701 , 400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .  
The Commission focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
Meanwhile , short - and medium-term measures include confidence-building at the regional and global levels , transparency in the field of armaments , a steady reduction of military expenditures , the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interim .  
They will continue as usual to follow their economic , educational , political and social development plans and programmes , knowing that the end of the twentieth century will not automatically mean an end to current regional conflicts .  
Among the activities promoted by local and regional authorities , labour unions and non-governmental organizations were international and national conferences on the issues associated with ageing , ranging from broad cultural and social debates to more focused discussions of the specific economic , medical and psychological concerns of the elderly .  
Subsequently , at meetings held in Bolivia , Paraguay and Panama , the heads of State and Government of the Rio Group reaffirmed regional determination to combat and overcome poverty , as well as their conviction that a sustained process of economic and social development is the only guarantee of improving peoples quality of life and of democratic stability in Latin America . 
We must give special attention to following up the results achieved at Geneva next June , with a particular eye to translating the agreements from the global perspective of the General Assembly to their regional and national dimensions , with a view to consolidating a political culture in favour of social progress , to use the phrase employed at the Copenhagen meeting that marked the beginning of the social Summit .  
It has for long been recognized that environmental policies have to be based on mostly regional even global interests , not just on shortsighted national ones adopted in the context of that obsolete understanding of sovereignty .  
This policy would open the economy to market forces while at the same time restoring the valuable contribution of social action ; it would be geared to a gradual reduction of the imbalances and inequities of our current reality and to the transformation of relations between the State and civil society ; it would promote greater participation of communities in development efforts at the local and regional levels .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
We are delighted to see la Francophonie , built up over 30 years of cultural and technical cooperation , take on a new political dimension , particularly since the Hanoi Summit of 1997 , and to see it established as a full-fledged international organization working alongside other regional organizations and at the United Nations .  
In this decade the international legal order has been further developed , a number of new States have emerged , the new role and growing strength of the regional organizations has been confirmed , and strong emphasis has been placed on human rights .  
We are happy to conclude from the Secretary-Generals report that these advances of democracy have been strengthened in spite of internal social difficulties , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
In their recent joint declaration , the Presidents of the Central American countries expressed their resolve to undertake coordinated action on such crucial issues as protecting the human rights of migrants , combating drug trafficking and moving forward towards regional economic integration .  
Political , social and economic transformation now present us with a Central America free from armed conflict , a Central America with strengthened democratic institutions and a Central America in which peace , the protection of human rights and regional integration have been established on a solid footing .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
My delegation intends to play an active role in the preparations for the informal process , seeking to ensure broad input from all relevant actors , including regional organizations , various parts of the United Nations and the major groups identified in Agenda 21 , including civil society .  
The action plan could include management initiatives for regional fisheries bodies , monitoring and surveillance , penalties , port access arrangements , boat and gear identification , vessel registers , independent observers , product certification , trade and marketing documentation and memorandums of understanding between producing and consuming countries.Illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing is a difficult issue for Governments to deal with . 
In view of the recent dramatic collapse of many regional fisheries and the deterioration of many economies based on fisheries , we are concerned about illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing also called IUU fishing especially by vessels which are not members of regional fisheries organizations or arrangements or by reflagged vessels owned by nationals of Member States .  
We urge all domestic , regional and international institutions to factor international environmental concerns into mainstream decision-making regarding agriculture and industrial production , trade , economics , transportation and all other economic , social and developmental fields .  
This is eloquent proof that the international community is capable of an active search for appropriate responses to meet great challenges and for ways to tackle pressing regional problems .  
It has continued to pay special attention to the small Territories and to recommend the most suitable steps which would enable the people of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination ; it has taken steps to enlist worldwide support among Governments and regional , national and international organizations to achieve the objectives of the Declaration and to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
The European Union can not but remain deeply concerned that grave breaches of humanitarian law and human rights , the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons , attacks against humanitarian personnel , the use of child soldiers , ethnic hatred and arms trafficking remain among the key problems of regional and international concern .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
In the social and economic fields , the United Nations plays a unique role in the development process on the African continent by continuously supporting the building of the OAUs institutional capacities to promote regional economic integration of the States of Africa and to enhance the continents ability to take advantage of international and bilateral initiatives to promote development .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
While most concepts on transparency in military matters have been developed and implemented in a regional context , progress on the global level has been modest , and much remains to be done by the international community .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
The League of Arab States was a participant in regional and international preparatory meetings relating to population issues , which demonstrates our deep interest in this subject and our conviction that it is the role of mankind to work towards social development and to participate in political and national security affairs whether in our region or in the world at large .  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Particular attention will be required to coordinate eco-tourism ventures at the regional level , and to facilitate the sharing of information and experiences and the integration of the private sector within official development assistance supported eco-tourism projects .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .  
Noting especially that , in paragraph 123 of the Programme of Action , current regional and interregional conferences of ministers responsible for youth affairs in Africa , Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia were invited to intensify cooperation among each other and to consider meeting regularly at the international level under the aegis of the United Nations to provide an effective forum for a focused global dialogue on youth-related issues ,

In view of the vital role which peacekeeping operations played in a world plagued by regional and intraState conflicts , it was important to provide the financial , human and logistical resources needed for the effective fulfilment of their mandates .  
To reinforce understanding of the principles of image interpretation , participants were divided into groups on a regional basis ; each group studied a case where visual interpretation of satellite images played a key role .  
We are aware that the challenge posed by the pandemic requires an intensified coordinated response not just at the national level but at the regional and indeed global levels as well .  
Peacekeeping and peacebuilding required concerted and coherent efforts by the United Nations system and regional organizations in order to project a credible force and a workable transitional structure for the population concerned .  
The advantages and disadvantages of both courses of action and their widely differing legal , political and moral basis should be recognized , without overlooking the major differences between their application at regional level .  
There is no doubt whatsoever that robust and effective action will be required at the national , regional and international levels to deal with these issues , if the aims and objectives of the Declaration adopted in 1990 are to be fully realized .  
Rich in biodiversity , the countries of the Rio Group had made huge efforts at the national , regional and subregional level to protect their environment and to balance economic , social and environmental factors in promoting genuine sustainable development .  
Unfortunately , the peacekeeping resources of the Organization are not limitless , and they must be apportioned in the best possible way , in a manner commensurate with the real danger posed by a given conflict to regional and global stability .  
The Agencys social and economic support to the refugees over the past half century had been a key factor in regional stability , and adequate services continued to be vital .  
Building on strong national and regional programmes and on programmes that address key shared and systemic constraints at the global level , UNDP has renewed its commitment to play a lead role in the fight against world poverty .  
Was aware that sustainable energy policy interventions can make important contributions to economic welfare , to social welfare , and to protecting the local , regional and global environment ;  
Aware that individual action can not suffice in this field , Tunisia has developed a close and fruitful cooperation with other States at the regional and bilateral levels , based on a continuing exchange of expertise and information with our partners .  
Propose a provisional agenda and possible main themes for the Summit based on the outcomes of the preparatory activities at the national , subregional , regional and international levels , as well as taking into account the input of major groups ;  
Making the energy system more efficient contributes to improving local air quality and health , and to reducing regional acidification , and offers considerable potential for greenhouse gas reduction .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
This global initiative aims to expand and deepen understanding of human rights advocacy and develop womens capacities to be influential advocates in national , regional and international forums .  
The meeting also considered that the effective implementation of agreements required appropriate institutional arrangements at the national and regional levels as well as the financial and technical support of the international community .  
Adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999,3 the text contained in the annex to the present decision as a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process , on the understanding that the preliminary agenda is of an indicative nature and will evolve during the substantive preparatory process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  3 Paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 reads as follows :  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Exploring innovative sources for financing for development : considering innovative global instruments , including tax cooperation and global public goods financing mechanisms ; enhancing the contribution of multilateral development institutions , in particular the World Bank and regional development banks , in financial innovation in support of development ; promoting national and international public / private partnerships .  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,  
Consideration of global public goods that is based on solid assessment of public goods needs , outlining the value added and comparative advantage of new efforts , taking into account the existing experiences of national , regional and international efforts in order to avoid duplication .  
While we understand that armed conflict may occur within States , we do not agree to limiting the concept of prevention to intra-State conflict , given that continuing , potentially explosive regional and international situations require major efforts to prevent them from erupting into global armed conflicts .  
The Commission acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development considered agenda item 3 , entitled Progress in preparatory activities for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , as well as by major groups , jointly with agenda item 6 , entitled Process for setting the agenda and determining possible main themes for the Summit in a timely manner . 
The Commission acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development considered agenda item 6 , entitled Process for setting the agenda and determining possible main themes for the Summit in a timely manner jointly with agenda item 3 , entitled Progress in preparatory activities for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , as well as by major groups ( see chap .  III ) .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 55 / 199 , of 20 December 2000 , which laid out the terms of reference for the preparatory process for the World Summit , and emphasizing the need for an open , participatory and fully transparent preparatory process at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ,  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish and operate regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Welcomes the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the pilot project on the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations , 18 and also welcomes the extensive network of partnerships established with local , regional and national broadcasters in Member States , and concurs with the Secretary-General that the implementation of the project has been one of the more successful examples of the reorientation of the Department of Public Information ;  
Also calls upon States and regional economic integration organizations to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the United Nations Environment Programme in order to support the interim arrangements and the operation of the Conference of the Parties until the end of the fiscal year in which the first meeting of the Conference of Parties takes place , and to ensure the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the further work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ;  
Requests the Executive Director to organize the first intergovernmental review meeting on the status of the implementation of the Global Programme of Action in November 2001 with participation of Governments , international governmental and non-governmental organizations , international and regional financing institutions , private sector and other stakeholders and major groups , paying due attention to the use of innovative financial mechanisms for implementing the Global Programme of Action and to promote the involvement of Governments , the private sector , international financial institutions and the civic society in addressing this issue ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
Noting the importance that the global meetings of regional seas conventions and action plans have taken as a consultative mechanism for the revitalization of Regional Seas Programme , including the strengthening of partnerships with international organizations dedicated to marine and coastal issues and the establishment of programmatic linkages with global environmental conventions and related agreements ,  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
As to his own preventive role , the Secretary-General thinks that it could be enhanced by increasing the use of interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile areas ; by developing regional prevention strategies with regional partners and the relevant United Nations organs and agencies ; by establishing an informal network of eminent persons ; and by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
Other actors , such as regional organizations , the international financial institutions and civil society , also have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of Member States to strengthen their capacity to respond to factors such as exclusion and inequality , which , if left unchecked , can spark violent confrontations .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
If international and regional conflicts were once a result of the cold-war climate that then prevailed , the past decade , which saw the end of the cold war , was marked by regional and civil strife that was more brutal , more tragic and more devastating than the conflicts of the cold-war era .  
Instead of responding to the repeated calls of regional and international organizations that it take the necessary steps to demonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other neighbouring countries and that it change its political and informational language with a view to establishing an atmosphere of confidence , Iraq at the Arab summit held in Jordan last March rejected the inclusion of a paragraph in the final declaration renewing its commitment to guaranteeing the security and sovereignty of the State of Kuwait . 
For all genuine regional and international efforts to succeed in Somalia , it becomes necessary that all actors reach a common , objective and unbiased vision about the real tasks ahead .  
We pay tribute to the efforts of Djibouti and its President for their tireless efforts leading to the convening of the Somalia National Peace Conference in Arta , where , for the first time , a sound and correct foundation was laid for achieving consensus among 5,000 Somalis representing all social , religious , ethnic and regional factions throughout Somalia .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
The Council looks forward to receiving information on the financial implications of the follow-on mission and a detailed assessment of shared responsibilities among the principal interacting players , i.e . the United Nations system , international financial institutions , regional mechanisms and national donors in their efforts to assist East Timor in its unprecedented transition to self-government .  
First , the United Nations would convene a meeting , at a venue to be determined , of representatives of the Northern Alliance and existing processes later complemented by representatives of other groups to ensure fair representation for all parts of Afghan society to agree on a framework for the process of political transition .  Secondly , the meeting would suggest concrete steps for the convening of a provisional council , which would be composed of a fairly large and representative group of Afghans drawn from all ethnic and regional communities .  
We are convinced that the United Nations should play the central role in facilitating the transformation of Afghanistan into a normal , stable and prosperous state not only because averting the threat to regional and international security emanating from Taliban-controlled territory falls squarely within the purview of the Security Council and the General Assembly , but also because we believe that only within the context of the United Nations can we find practical solutions that would be acceptable to all parties to the peace process , thereby ensuring the parties cooperation in their implementation .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
The participants in the regional workshops have included : representatives of institutions involved in disaster reduction , civil protection and emergency response activities ; representatives of international and regional organizations involved in supporting disaster management ; representatives of space agencies with activities related to disaster management ; and experts in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communications and positioning via satellites .  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
It expressed satisfaction at the progress made , and it affirmed its genuine desire to advance the GCC process in order to keep pace with ongoing changes at the regional and international levels so as to achieve the worthy aspirations and objectives set forth in the GCC Statute .  
The Scientific Committees mandate included review of published scientific reports and technical documents with the aim of assessing regional and global levels of human exposure to radiation and its potential harmful effects .  
UNIFEM believed that it was critical for women to take part in shaping the policies and practices that governed national , regional and global agreements in such areas as social responsibility of corporations , new trade agreements , reconstruction of societies emerging from war , or actions to respond to the scourge of HIV / AIDS . Womens voices and priorities must be heard .  
The comprehensive agenda of the Committee , spanning the domestic , regional and global dimensions of economic , social and cultural rights , bodes well for the future , as does the immense interest shown for bridging the gap between the rhetoric on economic , social and cultural rights and the operative priorities at all levels . 
Content : Structural features and trade flows , regional and international trade ; the changing role of commodities and services ; trade facilitation , information technology and transport and logistics ; e-commerce ; trade and environment policies , trade and environment in the World Trade Organization ( selected WTO agreements , dispute settlement , built-in agenda ) ; market access ; TRIPS ; traditional knowledge ; as well as the positive agenda and basic elements for the formulation of a developing country trade policy .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
The ability of the Office of the High Commissioner to take action must be strengthened in order to further the realization of economic , social and cultural as well as civil and political rights and to reinforce coordination between the Office and other international and regional organizations with a view to facilitating better analysis of the situation in that area and the adoption of preventive measures .  
The lack of political will , an unrepresentative Council distanced from ground realities when mandating peacekeeping operations without taking the views of troop-contributing countries into account , unwise reliance on regional solutions , a commitment gap resulting in the United Nations accepting inadequate units as a matter of political expediency , and a financially burdened Organization trying to overreach itself are , in summary , the crux of the problems confronting United Nations peacekeeping .  
A final meeting , hosted by the Government of Austria in Vienna in January 1998 , widened the consultative process still further and included legal experts from the various geographic regions as well as representatives from a broad cross-section of relevant United Nations and other international agencies , regional organizations and NGOs . 
The reasons were weak economic governance , lack of response to stabilization measures , weak institutional and physical infrastructure , small domestic markets and limited access to regional and global markets , and also the absence of a critical mass of small - and medium-sized enterprises .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
Determined to alleviate the plight of populations in the regions of the world besieged by armed conflicts and criminality , which are fuelled by illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , in a manner that would bring the benefits of social and economic development and national , regional and international stability ,  
She also requested additional information on the nature of the regional thematic round tables , which were to be held in conjunction with selected interactive thematic sessions .  
For each State or regional economic integration organization ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to this Protocol after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of such action , this Protocol shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of deposit by such State or organization of the relevant instrument or on the date this Protocol enters into force pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article , whichever is the later . 
The European Union considered that there was a need for parallel action on all fronts : the fight against poverty , suppression of trafficking , prosecution of those responsible , education and training , and rehabilitation of child victims ; and that all parties concerned must be mobilized , that international cooperation must be strengthened by multilateral , regional and bilateral arrangements as necessary , and that the private sector ( tourism industry , Internet exploiters ) must be mobilized .  
The member countries had at their disposal various regional and international legal instruments to guide them in the defence and promotion of the rights of the child , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which had been ratified by all the member countries of the Rio Group , and the instruments drawn up by the Inter-American Childrens Institute , founded in 1927 with the aim of supporting policies relating to childhood , fostering the bonds between the State and civil society , and shaping a regional awareness of the problems of children . 
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya considered that regional efforts should be focused on ensuring that scientific achievements in the nuclear field were used for peaceful purposes and hoped that a regular exchange between countries of information on the research undertaken would be set up .  
Algeria , which had always encouraged the international community to combat the scourge of terrorism in strict accordance with the principles of international law , had adopted national measures , acceded to relevant regional and international conventions and was trying to fully fit in with the frameworks of cooperation established at all levels .  
The Organization of American States had set up an institutional framework to enhance concerted action at the regional level through instruments such as the 1996 Lima Declaration and Plan of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eliminate Terrorism and the 1998 Mar del Plata Commitment , which condemned terrorist acts , irrespective of political , ideological , ethnic or religious considerations . 
Accordingly , the Executive Committee agreed to entrust their regional managers with the effective monitoring of CCAs and UNDAFs in their respective regions and to task them proactively to provide the necessary support to their country representatives , to contribute to and use the results of the CCA / UNDAF Learning Network on a systematic basis and to continue their joint inter-agency meetings and reports to the Executive Committee either on a quarterly or a biannual basis .  
At the national level these pertained to a regulatory framework , legal security , combating corruption , political and macroeconomic stability , market size ( through regional economic cooperation ) , growth potential and the availability of infrastructure and human resources .  
To promote Mauritius as a regional hub for financial and business services , participants called for policies that focused on creating capacity for rapid response in particular , accelerating the privatization programme , removing red tape , and keeping business and telecommunications costs down , as well as strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) by increasing quality and innovation for a quick turnaround in value-added activities .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
He drew attention to the fact that Saudi Arabia had submitted requests for membership in the Committee on several occasions and on 24 May 2000 had addressed to the Committee a memorandum on that subject in which it had outlined its expertise and activities with regard to outer space and the measures it had taken to encourage private sector participation in such activities at the national , regional and international levels . 
The Secretary-Generals report on facilities management ( A / 54 / 628 ) provided updated information on the major global properties owned , leased or rented at principal duty stations and regional commissions , including the current replacement value of each property and issues related to the long-range maintenance , alteration , improvement and expansion of existing buildings .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
The work of the Committee also addressed technical issues dealing with the content of SDI , including the definition of a common geodetic reference frame , the necessity of integrating cadastral and topographical data bases , the development of metadata and clearinghouse sites , and the employment of international standards ( ISO / TC 211 ) in the implementation of national and regional SDI .  
The current achievements in spatial standards were presented , with emphasis on their goals to support understanding of the use of geographic information , increase availability access , integration and sharing of geographic information , and assist in the establishment of spatial data infrastructure at the local , regional , and global levels .  
The challenge for the cartographic / SDI community is not only knowing how to harness the enormous potential of geographic information / SDI technologies but also having the ability to restructure national mapping agencies and other governmental organizations to cooperate with one another and to create regional and global data infrastructure standards .  
Emphasizing the urgent need for recognition of the collective and shared responsibility of the international community in addressing the root causes of the drug problem and threats related thereto in a comprehensive manner through an intersectoral approach and coordination at the national , regional and international level ,  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The increasing problems of organized crime , illegal trafficking , economic stagnation and political instability can be adequately dealt with only within a regional framework and with a unified international approach .  
The importance that regional workshops undertaken within the Framework be accompanied by concrete and sustainable subregional and national activities , as well as by training and awareness programmes for government officials and key professional groups such as the police , prison officials , educators , judges , lawyers , and parliamentarians , was also recognized .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
The increase of $ 141,600 includes the delayed impact of the new posts established in the biennium 2000-2001 and the reclassification of the post of the Chief of the Unit , which is responsible for the implementation of the subprogramme , from the P-5 level to D-1 , to reflect the increased responsibilities of the post and its greater professional interaction at the national , regional , subregional and inter-agency levels .  
The reclassification reflects the substantive nature of the tasks involved , as well as increased responsibilities and greater professional interaction with regional representatives of United Nations programmes and agencies , resident coordinators , high-level government officials at the country level and chief executives and senior staff of the regional economic communities , intergovernmental organizations and NGOs .  
Objective : To promote the development of statistics at the national level and coordinate them at the regional level in order to effectively meet planning , policy-making and administrative requirements for addressing emerging national and regional economic and social priorities .  
During the biennium 2000-2001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established three regional disaster response advisory units in Asia , the Pacific and South America to assist disaster-prone countries in improving rapid response preparedness and support to Governments , national civil defence institutions and the United Nations resident coordinators and United Nations agencies during the emergency phase following the initial impact of natural disasters , as well as technological accidents and environmental emergencies .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Urges Governments and regional organizations to make use of the limited international special surveillance list of substances established by the Board , adapted or supplemented , where appropriate , by lists of chemicals subject to voluntary monitoring , to reflect national and regional situations and changing trends in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
A provision of $ 337,500 was made to cover the cost of peacekeeping assistance team seminars in South America , training courses for military and civilian police and national trainers on peacekeeping , human rights and humanitarian assistance at the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization at Turin , Italy , as well as for assistance to national and regional training and to multilateral and multidimensional exercises .  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism .  
Monitoring the implementation of sustainable development goals through the assessment of data collected at the national , regional and international levels is one of the main objectives of the Division for Sustainable Development . 16 As decided by the Commission on Sustainable Development in 1993 , the Division invites Governments and organizations to submit the relevant information to the Commission . 
Representatives of national councils on sustainable development who met at a forum , organized in conjunction with the eighth session of the Commission would have welcomed a longer lead time and more thorough regional consultations in advance of the meeting to consolidate better their respective positions on the issues considered at the Commission .  
The Vienna Declaration contains the commitment to develop comprehensive crime prevention strategies at the international , national , regional and local levels to address the root causes and risk factors of crime and victimization through social , economic , health , educational and justice policies ( para .  25 ) .  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
The following priorities were identified during the operational segment : first , increased priority was to be assigned to demand reduction ; secondly , increased support was to be provided to Governments in countering the threat of synthetic drugs , in particular ATS ; and thirdly , at the regional level , increased attention should be given to countering the drug problem in Africa , without neglecting other regions where UNDCP was currently operating .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Urges the international community , including regional organizations , to undertake a greater and more determined financial and technical cooperation effort to support and promote alternative development projects , drawn up as part of national programmes , on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility as a pillar of international cooperation in countering the world drug problem ;  
Emphasizing that at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , States undertook to promote multilateral , regional , subregional , and bilateral cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities to deal with criminal organizations involved in drug-related offences ,  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
On the basis of the Pact and goals of the League of Arab States , in an atmosphere of mutual understanding , brotherhood and sincerity , the leaders studied the state of the Nation , the challenges confronting it and the situation in the region and took a comprehensive inventory of regional and international circumstances , focusing on promoting Arab solidarity , reactivating the institutions of joint Arab endeavour , upholding the interests and rights of the Nation and maintaining Arab national security .  
In the interests of enabling the League of Arab States to fulfil its mission , perform its tasks , implement its programmes and carry out its activities , the leaders charged the Secretary-General of the League with taking the necessary steps and proposing appropriate formulas for the reform of all financial , administrative and organizational aspects of the General Secretariat of the League with a view to restructuring it , enhancing its working methods and performance and enabling it to address national requirements and keep pace with new developments at the regional and international levels . 
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional and sectoral levels .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
By its decision 1 / 1 , the Committee adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 , a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process as contained in the annex to that decision , on the understanding that this preliminary agenda was of an indicative nature and would evolve during the substantive process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  
Section I contains information on the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council , which have been grouped , on the basis of their institutional status , into seven categories : ( a ) functional commissions , ( b ) regional commissions , ( c ) standing committees , ( d ) ad hoc committees , ( e ) expert bodies composed of governmental experts , ( f ) expert bodies composed of members serving in their personal capacity and ( g ) related bodies .  
Welcoming the announced reduction of the United Army Group in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation and the number of checkpoints , and also welcoming the re-establishment of a judicial system with a supreme court , and regional and city courts in the Republic of Chechnya , the increased involvement of ethnic Chechens in the police forces as well as the mixed composition at checkpoints ,  
Urges the Government of the Russian Federation to ensure international , regional and national humanitarian organizations , notably those of the United Nations and their implementing partners as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross , free , unimpeded and secure access to the Republic of Chechnya and neighbouring republics of the Russian Federation , in accordance with international humanitarian law , and to facilitate their activities , including the delivery of humanitarian aid , inter alia by simplifying regulations , and their access to a radio communication network for the United Nations ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
Stressing the variety of forms , modalities and experiences of democratic societies , taking into account national and regional particularities , the various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds , and the diversity of economic , political , cultural and legal systems ,  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
In Economic and Social Council resolution 2000 / 35 , the Council decided to invite executive heads of relevant organizations of the United Nations system and heads of other relevant international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments to form a collaborative partnership on forests to support the work of UNFF and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants , and facilitate and promote coordinated and cooperative action , including joint programming .  
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .

Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
This initiative is expected to promote regional integration through enhancing the collective value of small and fragmented markets in the creation of trade and the expansion of exports ; develop shared infrastructure ; and tackle common environmental and social problems .  
The programme of work under this section has been elaborated within the framework of programme 15 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 ( A / 55 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , which identifies three major themes : ( a ) promoting regional economic cooperation ; ( b ) alleviating poverty in rural and urban areas ; and ( c ) protecting the environment , improving the management of natural resources and focusing on the development of infrastructure and information systems .  
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?

Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Welcomes the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the pilot project on the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations , [ 12 ] and also welcomes the extensive network of partnerships established with local , regional and national broadcasters in Member States , and concurs with the Secretary-General that the implementation of the project has been one of the more successful examples of the reorientation of the Department of Public Information ;  
Weaknesses in some national laws , regulations , licensing procedures and enforcement mechanisms are exacerbated by lack of capacity , insufficient political will , inconsistent approaches and inadequate coordination and cooperation at the national , bilateral , regional and global levels .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) strengthening the regulation capacities of the key State institutions ( including relations between the authorities ) ; ( b ) contributing to the decentralization and deconcentration of the central authorities ; ( c ) improving performance and access to justice ; and ( d ) increasing social , national , local and regional cohesion , and promoting the exercise of fundamental rights . 
At the international level , determining change over time and producing comparable regional and global assessments require extensive data assessment and analysis , drawing on detailed data source documentation and expert knowledge .  
As a global approach covering , in a coherent manner , the specific requirements of national , regional and international markets regarding quality standards , does not exist , companies are inclined to adopt the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 series of standards .  
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .

Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Encourages the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions , to document and disseminate innovative and successful practices of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , including triangular cooperation arrangements and those supported by the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
He acknowledged that the increasing sophistication and complexity of TCDC activities , greater regional and inter-country cooperation among developing countries , increased resource allocations for TCDC by developing countries , greater emphasis on long-term cooperation and enhanced modalities of triangular cooperation marked the maturity of the emerging trends in the area of TCDC observed in the previous biennium .  
In order to promote informed decision-making by central , regional or local authorities in proceedings concerning accidental pollution of transboundary inland waters , countries should facilitate participation of the public likely to be affected in hearings and preliminary inquiries and the making of objections in respect of proposed decisions , as well as recourse to and standing in administrative and judicial proceedings .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The Workshop underlined the importance of indigenous media as an indispensable tool to promote indigenous identity , language , culture , self-representation and collective and human rights , and as a vehicle for communicating international , regional and national issues to indigenous communities as well as conveying community concerns to a wider public .  
The President also informed members that , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , entities of the United Nations system , including programmes , funds , specialized agencies and regional commissions , with specific expertise in the subject matter of the special session , might make statements in the debate in plenary , provided that they were represented at the highest level .  
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .  
I encourage the Security Council to consider innovative mechanisms , such as establishing a subsidiary organ , an ad hoc informal working group or other informal technical arrangement to discuss prevention cases on a continuing basis , particularly with regard to periodic regional or subregional reports that I intend to submit to the Council , as well as other early warning or prevention cases brought to its attention by Members States .  
With the support of Member States , I intend to enhance the traditional preventive role of the Secretary-General in four ways : first , by increasing the use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile regions ; second , by developing regional prevention strategies with our regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies ; third , by establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention ; and fourth , by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
The national forums , working in close collaboration with development partners , could provide a platform for regular and systematic follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of commitments by individual LDCs and their development partners at the national level , as well as providing inputs to follow-up at the global , regional , subregional and sectoral levels .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Noting with grave concern that Africa , in particular sub-Saharan Africa , is currently the worst affected region where HIV / AIDS is considered as a state of emergency , which threatens development , social cohesion , political stability , food security and life expectancy and imposes a devastating economic burden and that the dramatic situation on the continent needs urgent and exceptional national , regional and international action ;  
Acknowledging that prevention of HIV infection must be the mainstay of the national , regional and international response to the epidemic ; and that prevention , care , support and treatment for those infected and affected by HIV / AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response and must be integrated in a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic ;  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
We underline the essential contribution of independent specialized bodies at national , regional or local levels in promoting equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin or religious background ;  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
Furthermore it urges them to work in partnership at the national , regional and international levels to develop appropriate policy tools that facilitate the development of legislation , policies and programmes that take into account ethnic , racial , linguistic , religious and cultural diversity ;  
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is invited , in cooperation with the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , concerned specialized and regional organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations active in the field of promotion and protection of human rights , to undertake periodic consultations and to encourage research activities aimed at collecting , maintaining and adapting the technical , scientific , educational and information materials produced by all cultures around the world to fight racism ;  
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
Action is required at all levels national , regional and worldwide and in many areas : disarmament , peacekeeping and peace-building , combating organized crime , ensuring the responsibility of producer and consumer States , without forgetting the need , in parallel , to pursue the whole range of actions to prevent and combat the underlying causes of conflicts .  For the moment , a single aim must nevertheless inspire us , that of responding to the problem of human suffering and insecurity .  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
These include the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , the development , together with relevant regional organizations , of regional preventive strategies and the establishment of an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
The Government of Kuwait also provided information on a series of legal , practical and other measures that it had taken , including accession to international conventions , promotion of forms of international cooperation through bilateral agreements , support for regional endeavours and , at the internal level , measures to develop its national legislation and regulations .  
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
The Special Committee therefore regards this regional seminar as a critical first step in this second International Decade , as we proceed to devise international strategies in a concerted effort to ensure that this sacred right to self-determination , this basic human right , is realized in all of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , so that the people might achieve their full political equality consistent with recognized international standards . 
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations and regional organizations to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Recalling that the goals and targets in the economic , social and related fields contained in the Millennium Declaration [ 2 ] and the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits , supplemented by the outcomes of their reviews , constitute a comprehensive basis for actions at the national , regional and international levels ,  
The subjects addressed included study of the background to the approach of the United Nations to the phenomenon of mercenaries ; the state of international legislation on that subject , with special emphasis on article 47 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions , regional legislation , particularly the Organization of African Unity Convention ; national legislation and evaluation of the means used to implement existing legislation .  
Based on the recommendations of that meeting , ESCWAs work in the current biennium ( 2000-2001 ) is concentrated on policies to alleviate poverty , with emphasis on issues of poverty and youth , the role of income-generating activities among the poor , and improving the standards of living of local communities through microcredit lending and community development , based on an integrated regional training programme .  
The Preparatory Committee drew up a list of participants in the conference , including all Member States of the United Nations and observers , the various related components of the United Nations secretariat , specialized agencies , UNESCO chairs in the field of human rights and interreligious dialogue , treaty and non-treaty human rights mechanisms regional organizations , international organizations of an educational or cultural nature , national and regional human rights institutes , national human rights commissions , and experts from religious or confessional groups and non-governmental organizations .  
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
The Syrian Arab Republic advocates transparency in armaments as a means of enhancing international peace and security and believes that , in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain well-defined basic principles : it must be balanced , comprehensive and non-discriminatory , and it must enhance the national , regional and international security of all States in conformity with international law .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
A possible strategy is to establish such a capacity gradually , by assisting in developing requisite training / pedagogical material and by providing assistance in course delivery in a developing country on a regional basis jointly with local professional associations ( freight forwarders , exporters etc . ) and / or academic institutions .  
The principal objectives of the Network are to expand mutual support , cooperation and joint activities , including through information exchanges , training and development , undertaking joint projects , sharing expertise , periodical regional meetings and seminars , and mutually assisting each other with respect to requests from other national institutions regarding human rights violations .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
The representative of Brazil stated that for Brazil , a transit country for Paraguay and Bolivia , needed concrete proposals for the creation of innovative financial instruments of the national , regional and international levels , by financial institutions operating in the region .  
The representative of Peru stated that for Peru , a transit country for Bolivian trade , there is a need to establish financial instruments at national , regional and international levels : international financial institutions could help through special and innovative programmes to support the development , improvement and maintenance of needed physical infrastructure .  
The development of a coherent , national , regional and international transport network combined with efficient transport services are essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
With regard to the role of international agreements , he pointed out that so far recognition of the importance of technology transfer for developing countries was only formal in nature , expressed solely through the existence of the relevant international and regional arrangements , but that further refinement of those arrangements was needed in order to facilitate the practical possibilities of their actual implementation .  
As regards physical infrastructure , development partners committed to supporting infrastructure development , both through public investment and by facilitating private investment , and particularly for the creation of essential infrastructure to facilitate the functioning of liberalized domestic and regional markets .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Mindful that , in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;

They agreed that it was vital to address the problem in a comprehensive , integrated , sustainable and efficient manner , and recommended a series of practical actions to be taken by OAU member States at the national and regional levels .  
Urges States and encourages the private sector to promote the development by the media , including the print and electronic media , including the Internet and advertising , taking into account their independence , through their relevant associations and organizations at the national , regional and international levels , of a voluntary ethical code of conduct and self-regulatory measures , in order : ( a ) To combat racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and do away with stereotypes ;  
Based on these principles , a set of new concepts has emerged and started to take form : a new security concept which consists in mutual trust , disarmament and cooperative security ; a new type of international relationship which centres on partnership and non-alignment ; and a new model of regional cooperation in which all countries , large or small , jointly take the initiative in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation .  
Stressing the need for the maintenance of regional and international peace and stability and friendly relations among all States , and underlining the overriding political , humanitarian and moral imperatives as well as the economic advantages of preventing the outbreak and escalation of conflicts ,  
It could be rather useful to make the CST closer to the regional and national levels by organizing , in the period between the Conferences of the Parties , the regional meetings of the CST reflecting , in more complex basis , interlinkages with the activities of relevant subsidiary bodies ( scientific and technology ) of other global conventions and regional agreements .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
Appeals to the international community , United Nations bodies , international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources , including through the new global fund to fight HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit in 2001 and by the Secretary-General , for developing countries , particularly in Africa , with a view to enabling them to fully implement the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the Roll Back Malaria initiative ;  
The Assembly made a number of recommendations to Governments and Member States , in particular to countries of origin and destination , calling on them to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
As far as the Macedonian contribution to the joint action in combating terrorism is concerned , my Government decided to prepare draft legislation on combating terrorism and to amend already existing legislation in this area , in order to comply with relevant regional and international conventions and other decisions of the United Nations , thus acting in compliance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) .  
In this regard , the Jordanian Government has taken many national measures to combat terrorism , from which Jordan has often suffered as a result of difficult political regional and international conditions .  On the national level , requisite punitive legislation was enacted to punish all forms of terrorist activities , bring perpetrators to justice and suppress the financing of such acts .  
Specifically , in resolution 1355 ( 2001 ) of 15 June 2001 , the Council called on all relevant parties to ensure that urgent child protection concerns were addressed in all national , bilateral and regional dialogues and that child soldiers were expeditiously demobilized , and urged Member States to ensure adequate and sustained resources for long-term reintegration .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
Calls upon all relevant bodies , agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental , regional and subregional organizations , within their continuing mandated activities , to continue to address the issue of international migration and development and to provide appropriate support for interregional , regional and subregional processes and activities on international migration and development , with a view to integrating migration issues in a more coherent way within the broader context of the implementation of agreed economic and social development programmes ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The development of a coherent , national , regional and international transport network , combined with efficient transport services , are essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The studies point out that development of a coherent rural , national and international transport network is essential for stimulating economic activity , opening up productive areas in individual countries and linking them to national , regional and international markets .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
To this end , an annual meeting at the level of permanent missions in New York , to exchange views , coordinate strategies and adopt a common regional position among member States would be an important forum in which similar experiences can be shared and solutions sought to common problems .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
The Inter-American Democratic Charter represents an important initiative , promoted by Peru , and reflects regional consensus on an unprecedented instrument which systematizes principles , norms and mechanisms for collective action , including diplomatic sanctions in cases of alteration or interruption of democratic institutionality , with a view to promoting , preserving and defending democracy from a human rights perspective .  
The Board noted that UNAFRI salary scales had been determined by the Board at its inaugural session in June 1989 , and considered that the scales should be reviewed in order to bring them in line with the scales of other comparable regional bodies , thus enabling UNAFRI to attract and retain suitably qualified and competent personnel . 
Belarus is convinced that a gradual movement from simple to more complex bilateral and multilateral measures and agreements will create a solid basis for preventing armed conflict and strengthening national and regional security , which in turn are integral elements of the modern architecture of a comprehensive and indivisible system of international security .  
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
On prospects for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture , the panellists said that enthusiasm had given way to the perception that it was virtually impossible to reach consensus on such reform , and that second-best solutions in the form of do-it-yourself approaches to crisis prevention and management at both the regional and national levels currently appeared to be the only politically feasible alternative .  
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
On 16 November of this year , heads of State and Government are expected to sign the Almaty Act , the final document of this regional forum , which reflects major aspects of cooperation : joint activities to combat new threats , including terrorism , separatism , extremism , illegal drugs and weapon trafficking ; a regional mechanism for the elaboration and application of confidence-building mechanisms in their broader meaning ; the institutionalization of the CICA , its structure , Secretariat , regular and specialized meetings , and academic and professional inputs .  
Invites the Secretary-General , the Economic and Social Council , the Commission for Social Development , the regional commissions , the relevant agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental forums , within their respective mandates , to take on a priority basis and in a coordinated manner all steps necessary to ensure the effective implementation of all commitments and undertakings contained in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action and in the further initiatives for social development , and to continue to be actively involved in their follow-up ;  
Recognizes the importance of the full and effective participation of youth and youth organizations at the local , national , regional and international levels in promoting and implementing the World Programme of Action and in evaluating the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation and of the need to support the activities of youth mechanisms that have been set up by youth and youth organizations , bearing in mind that young people are active agents for positive change and development in society ;  
The use of coercive measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , whether unilaterally or under the auspices of regional and international organizations , poses a genuine threat to international peace and security and is in manifest violation of human rights principles .  
The United Nations and other organizations , whether of an international or regional character , have adopted an enormous number of resolutions condemning the use of unilateral coercive economic measures because of the great damage they do to the economies of the developing countries and their negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a just and non-discriminatory trading system .  
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
His delegation called for the strengthening of regional and international mechanisms designed to contain conflicts and their destructive consequences , curb the factors that led to their outbreak and prosecute those responsible for acts involving human rights violations , terrorism , trafficking of drugs and prohibited weapons , organized crime and money-laundering , among others .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
The participants acknowledged that the spread of internal conflicts requires enhanced international and regional cooperation to tackle their root causes and committed themselves to improving coordination of their efforts in the fields of preventive action and peace-building .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
But we are prepared for cooperation as sovereign equals , in accordance with the new realities of a world where the principal national objectives of States can be achieved through economic and political cooperation , rather than military conquest or regional or global domination .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .

The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .
