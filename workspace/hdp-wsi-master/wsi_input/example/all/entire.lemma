In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .

Modern war is contention of the entire military systems and not simply confrontation between certain military systems , and it is victory in the main military domain that determines overall victory .  To gain temporary superiority in some non-crucial military domain by breaking the rules of war , even if that superiority is due to advanced technologies , will only bring partial victory which often ends in overall defeat .  This is because after the rules of war are broken , the side with overall superiority will become even more destructive amid the confusion .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .

The meeting stressed : General Secretary Jiang 's important idea of " three represents " is distinctly characteristic of the times and is very strong as a theory , highly practical , and highly relevant .  This is a major theoretical and practical issue put forward to the entire party .  
We must , in the patriotic spirit of Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , encourage the entire party and the people of the whole country to support from beginning to end taking economic construction as the center , industriously establishing China as a powerful , democratic , and civilized modernized socialist country , realizing the grand reemergence of the People 's Republic in the 21st Century .  
Li Peng stressed at the symposium : At present , juvenile delinquency has taken an upward trend in China ; and juvenile crimes tend to be committed at an increasingly younger age and by those criminal means that are generally employed by adults .  All this should be brought to the close attention of the entire society .  
Attention should be paid to increasing the proportion of the third industry , and greatly strengthening the economic vitality of the entire city , while at the same time putting a great effort behind promoting technological updates .  Enterprises developing new high technologies should be put in a prominent position , to allow manufacturing to develop in a reasonable direction .  
As the longest river in China , Chang Jiang has 1.7 square kilometers of drainage areas , one fourth of the country 's cultivated areas , and one third of the country 's entire population ; and turns out two fifths of the country 's total industrial and agricultural output value .

The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
As a matter of fact , it is impossible for the Chinese enterprises to head for the entire world without choice now .  We should first proceed from our own comparative advantages to select those regions that have their own comparative advantages , and make investment and set up factories there .  For instance , we should first gain access to the developing countries , the states of the former Soviet Union , the regions adjacent to West China , and so on .  
Meanwhile , along with the elimination of the feudal serf system , the cultural trait accompanying the old system that the Tibetan culture was monopolized by a tiny minority of serf owners will surely be " exterminated " ; and the old cultural autocracy featured by both an unification of the administration and the monastery and the dominance of region in Tibet 's entire social and political life will surely be eliminated .  This is a necessity in the development of the Tibetan history , and also a necessity in the development of the Tibetan culture .  
Adequately understanding the importance and urgency of cultural construction in line with the requirements of its 15th National Congress and from the height of the prosperity of the socialist cause and national rejuvenation is an important prerequisite for the entire party to better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
The increase in domestic and foreign demand stimulated comprehensive improvement in the production sector and enabled China 's entire economy to develop toward a good orientation .  The quality of economic performance improved steadily .  
I am convinced , positive scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation among countries of different social systems , economic modes , cultural traditions , and development levels are beneficial to the relevant parties and the entire world 's development .

It has been revealed that each test costs some $ 100 million , a preliminary system would cost $ 10 billion , and the entire system could cost as much as $ 60 billion .  Even after spending so much money , no one can say with certainty that the completed system would be flawless and problem free .  Besides , with the rapid development of modern science and technology , it is difficult to predict that the NMD would not become a pile of trash in the future .  
Wherever he went there , Zhu Rongji emphasized the necessity to strengthen unity among nationalities , safeguard the motherland 's unification , and maintain social stability .  He said that doing so is not only the basic prerequisite and guarantee for achieving extensive development of Xinjiang , but also of great significance to smoothly promoting the reform , opening up and modernization of the entire country .  He urged the cadres and people of all nationalities to treasure highly the current excellent situation of steady economic development and social stability .  
If war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , and sea transport is blockaded , foreign trade as a support for economic development will suffer serious setbacks , many industrial production departments will halt production and close down , and the entire economy will be facing tremendous blows .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
After the economically developed west , with its strong military forces , has been attacked and destroyed , Taiwan 's entire economic , political , and military systems will be in a state of chaos and paralysis , and no matter how strong the eastern defense base is , it will be unable to retrieve the war situation in the west .  
Only the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) was capable of leading the Chinese people to national independence , the liberation of the people , and the victory of socialism , and only by resolutely upholding the leading position of Deng Xiaoping theory in the entire Party and insisting unwaveringly on the Party 's basic line of " one center and two basic points " have we been able to achieve national revitalization , a strong and prosperous state , and happiness for the people .  
It was precisely at this extraordinary time and in a domestic and foreign environment of unprecedented complexity that , by relying on the concerted efforts of the entire people to overcome various difficulties , we still accomplished the " 9th Five-Year " plan successfully , ensuring the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the national economy and comprehensively accomplishing the second strategic step in the drive to modernization .  
With those in subordinate positions following the example set by their superiors , the entire industrial and commercial administration department of Zhuhai was " rotten from the inside out .

Designer Wang Huaiyi said that the research and development of a infrared remote sensor for space use is limited by the levels of a nation 's industrial , electronics , machining and other basic technologies .

The " Proposals " reflects the demands of the third-step strategic objective in socialist modernization , the demands of socialist market economic development , the demands of new situations in the new century , and the interests and aspirations of the broad masses .  The entire document is filled with the spirit of emancipating minds , seeking truth from facts , exploring and innovating , and seeking pragmatism .

Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided the powerful ideological weapon for our party to understand the world and remold the world , and it is also the spiritual dynamic to gather and inspire the entire party and people of the whole country to attain the common ideal and promote overall social progress .  
The 15th national party congress called on the entire party to set off a new upsurge of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory , for which the central authorities have taken a series of important measures .  Particularly since last year , the " three stresses " education has been conducted in a concentrated way among the party and government leading groups above the county level with remarkable results , which has played a significant role in promoting the regular and institutionalized ideological-political building of the leading groups .  
In drafting laws , we must correctly handle the relations between the central and local interests , the overall and partial interests , and the long-term and immediate interests , rationally divide and standardize the powers and functions of various state organs , and maintain a unified market in the entire country to guarantee and bring about a harmonious and orderly economic and social development .  
The most important point is whether the entire people possess a strong combat will .  This is also the core of the policy of " national defense by the whole people . "  As long as the people throughout the country strengthen their mental defense , reinforce the all-people 's defense mechanism , do not fear communist China 's propaganda offensive and military threat , and remain a backing for the government and armed forces , the armed forces will certainly have confidence and ability to ensure the country 's security .  
Facing such an intricate and complex international political , economic , and military struggle , in order to safeguard China 's national security and the unification of our motherland , ensure a smooth progress for our great socialist cause , and protect the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country , we must enhance our awareness of guarding against possible future mishaps and must reinforce our national defense building .  
What is particularly important is that the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee concentrated the wisdom of the entire party and approved the " Proposals of the CPC Central Committee on Drawing up the 10th Five-year Plan of Economic and Social Development , " which proposed the guiding thinking , goals of endeavor , and major measures for economic and social development in the next five to 10 years , united the will of the whole party , and specified the orientation for advance .  
It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .  The waves of impoverished developing countries opposing the developed countries headed by the United States will certainly surge higher and higher , class struggle will move from a country to the entire world , and the era of peace and development will come to an end , which will be replaced by the new round of revolution and war on a global scale .  
A viable rectification and improvement plan must be formulated and implemented , the leadership responsibilities for rectification and improvement defined and measures carried out .  Rectification and improvement must be made part of the entire process of study and educational activities - - studying on the one hand , improving and rectifying on the other - - using the actual rectification and improvement operation to attain the people 's trust .  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
We need to consider the situation as a whole with a broad field of vision , have a good grasp of the international economic , scientific , and technological development trend , keep abreast of the overall situation of economic development in the entire country , and seriously analyze and study the conditions of various localities to determine the key points for development .

There is also need to constantly secure and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front , bring into play the initiative and creativity of all social circles , and gather the wisdom and forces of the entire Chinese people .  Only in this way , will we succeed in our cause and achieve bigger victories .  This is a basic theory .

Back to the starting pointSun Ta-chuan , who is participating in the entire training project , responds that such criticism arises from a misunderstanding of the whole process .

In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
With his enthusiastic and unselfish personality , Lin has been collaborating with grateful artists in this way for 20 happy years . In the process he has amassed an entire storehouse full of ceramic works-a veritable museum of ceramics-without paying a single cent .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
From halfway up the mountain , the entire valley is visible . Looking up , one sees birds of prey circling . The dead acacia stands erect in the midst of a green forest halfway up the slope . When the wind blows , it exposes the silver back side of the leaves of the surrounding trees , and the dead acacia stands out still more clearly .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo , Singapore and Hong Kong , and it has cities like Shanghai , Beijing , and Bangkok running fast on its heels , " says Chen . Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years . It was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network .  
Worst-hit were low-lying districts such as Kushan and Sanmin , where the waters rose to cover the entire first-floor level . In all , 3600 buildings throughout the city were swamped . Underground parking-lots became underground reservoirs , and flooded transformer boxes blew out , cutting off electricity and water supplies to many buildings . In one dreadful incident , someone actually drowned while trying to get downstairs by elevator .  
In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
This happened during a leadership class when O-Young left the trail and fell behind the group in order to photograph some beautiful mountain scenery . Trying to catch up , he did what he was accustomed to do in Taiwan : he took a shortcut . When he came out ahead of the instructor , he was feeling mighty pleased with himself , only to be rebuked by the entire team .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
The plants were thereafter propagated to produce enough for entire plantations . Thanks to the cool and fresh climate , the plentiful rain , the fertile soil , and the warm sunshine during the day , the Tungting area offers ideal conditions for growing tea bushes .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens . The cafe would be filled with movie-going students , some of whom would order a single cup of coffee and stay an entire afternoon , and whom the proprietors never felt right about asking to move on . After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
Compared to an intense volcanic eruption on land , when an entire mountain turns red and a huge cloud of smoke and debris rises up into the heavens , the eruptions around Penghu were much smaller . The effect was rather more like liquid flowing through cracks . The lava flowed through , covering up the area all around , forming into flat or low-gradient tablelands tens of meters deep called " mesas . "  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .  
Protection of the local industry has become a leitmotif of the communist authorities ' video policy since 2000 . Fostered by the government , TV series have indeed seen rapid progress . Not only have they developed a distinct dramatic style native to China , they have also taken control of the viewership , and the high rate of return on investment is driving the development of the entire TV industry . Stations in every province are forming into groups that are capable of holding their own against the CCTV .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing . And so , as a result of all these factors combined , the outlook on filial piety within society as a whole has taken a 180-degree turn .  
" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .

The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
Several older women , looking indescribably happy , start their hands and feet in perpetual motion , and in a short time the entire area has been completely cleaned , a gas stove has been set up , and vegetables have been washed and chopped . Before you know it , the aroma of fried rice-noodles begins to permeate the clinic site .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .

Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .

On occasions , she will even take the animal home and care for it .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .

It clearly conveyed the great joy of transcendence of self that he had experienced at that moment .  
Mutouyu , located at the northernmost part of the Penghu islands , is comprised entirely of rocks , with reefs on all sides .

Every day the island is covered in a salt fog , with salt getting into your clothes and hair , making it very uncomfortable .  
One year , Kung planted his plots with a kind of mini-gourd , and the entire crop was hit by a mutation , causing the gourds to be more pear-shaped instead of their usual hourglass-like shape .

The seed company planted another row during summer , which produced gourds of the normal shape .

Because the sanctions regime , in practical terms , upsets the normal and balanced functioning of the economy of whole adjoining regions , undermining their entire economic infrastructure and rupturing external economic links , we need a mechanism for the careful consideration , before any decision is taken on imposing sanctions against any country , of the potential consequences of such a step both for the country targeted by the sanctions and for third countries .  
This statement of intent has changed nothing : the reality of the situation is that the sanctions imposed on Iraq have been continued as a means of collectively punishing an entire people , and the steps required from Iraq to end the sanctions have remained as vague as they have always been in the Council 's resolutions , as in paragraph 21 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , for instance .

As we express our concern today at the humanitarian situation and at the situation of refugees , we echo the concern expressed by the Government of Georgia last September during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , when it warned that the harsh conditions endured by more than 300,000 displaced persons scattered throughout the territory of Abkhazia apart from constituting a heavy burden upon the entire country are a factor for instability that blocks the consolidation of the peace process . 
While they are clearly assured of the support of UNTAES and the entire international community , it will be only through their political will and untiring efforts to reconcile and rebuild a harmonious multi-ethnic society that real progress can be achieved over the long term .

Such significant progress in political , economic and social conditions was contributing to an unprecedented quality of life for the entire population of Myanmar and not merely for the privileged few , as alleged by some critics .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;

We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
Urge all those involved in the implementation process to undertake urgent and effective measures to stop the tendency of ethnic partition of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and draw the attention of the international community to the serious threat to the stability of the entire Balkan region as a result of the prevailing tendency to support ethnic instead of democratic forces ;  
Given the deep and glaring involvement of the Government of the Sudan , as established by incontrovertible evidence presented on the international plane , in the entire conspiracy to assassinate the Egyptian Head of State , the latest smokescreen created by the Sudan defies all logic and borders on being so farcical that the Sudan will once again fail in its futile attempt to hoodwink international opinion .  
As long as more than one eighth of Lebanon is occupied and Israeli raids continue to blow up power stations , to interrupt daily life , to stifle the population with their aerial bombardment , killing women , children and the elderly before the eyes of the entire international community , the Security Council 's equating of aggressor and victim in its approach to Lebanon 's complaints will remain devoid of justice .  
Indeed , the English occupation in 1765 had been partial and precarious ; the fact that they had left tangible signs of possession to indicate their intention of returning could not constitute a legal claim that was more compelling than the continuous , effective and peaceful exercise of State sovereignty over the entire archipelago for many years .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .

Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The main difficulty in controlling illicit drugs was that well-organized , well-financed and closely-knit criminal cartels had flexible mechanisms , were capable of threatening entire States and did not hesitate to corrupt officials in order to reach their goals .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .

In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .

It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .

It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .

In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Given the central importance of Jerusalem to the Palestinian people , to the entire Arab and Muslim nation , to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and to the international community as a whole , the Council 's inaction stands in stark contrast to the collective position of the international community , as reflected in the Council , the great potential damage of Israel 's decision , its impact on the Middle East peace process , and the great harm wrought by the failure of the Council to adopt this draft resolution .

In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
Yan Qiang , an expert in political science , pointed out during an interview with this reporter : In recent years , the central authorities have showed a great determination in its fight against corruption , and has cracked a number of major and serious cases that shocked the entire society .

Modern war is contention of the entire military systems and not simply confrontation between certain military systems , and it is victory in the main military domain that determines overall victory .  To gain temporary superiority in some non-crucial military domain by breaking the rules of war , even if that superiority is due to advanced technologies , will only bring partial victory which often ends in overall defeat .  This is because after the rules of war are broken , the side with overall superiority will become even more destructive amid the confusion .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
Tung Chee-hwa said : Although we ran into some difficulties - - particularly the financial storm that swept across Asia - - after our reversion , the HKSAR government has taken resolute , daring , and effective measures in conjunction with the firm and persistent fighting spirit of the masses of residents to enable the HKSAR 's financial market to enjoy steady development and the entire economy to gradually move out of the trough and get back to the broad way of prosperity .

The meeting stressed : General Secretary Jiang 's important idea of " three represents " is distinctly characteristic of the times and is very strong as a theory , highly practical , and highly relevant .  This is a major theoretical and practical issue put forward to the entire party .  
We must , in the patriotic spirit of Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , encourage the entire party and the people of the whole country to support from beginning to end taking economic construction as the center , industriously establishing China as a powerful , democratic , and civilized modernized socialist country , realizing the grand reemergence of the People 's Republic in the 21st Century .  
Li Peng stressed at the symposium : At present , juvenile delinquency has taken an upward trend in China ; and juvenile crimes tend to be committed at an increasingly younger age and by those criminal means that are generally employed by adults .  All this should be brought to the close attention of the entire society .  
Attention should be paid to increasing the proportion of the third industry , and greatly strengthening the economic vitality of the entire city , while at the same time putting a great effort behind promoting technological updates .  Enterprises developing new high technologies should be put in a prominent position , to allow manufacturing to develop in a reasonable direction .  
As the longest river in China , Chang Jiang has 1.7 square kilometers of drainage areas , one fourth of the country 's cultivated areas , and one third of the country 's entire population ; and turns out two fifths of the country 's total industrial and agricultural output value .  The Chang Jiang valley plays a decisive role in China 's national economic and social development .  
The radioactive pollution resulting from the unlimited use of uranium-poor bombs in the war , together with the pollution and poison-bearing smoke and clouds caused by the accidental bombings of refineries , fertilizer plants , and pharmaceutical factories , has brought to Yugoslavia and the entire Balkan Peninsula a long-term ecological crisis hard to wipe out , resulting in persistent genetic freaks , leukemia , lung cancer , and other abnormal diseases .

This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Facing new situations and tasks , ideological and political development has shouldered heavy responsibilities .  The troops in the entire army will take Chairman Jiang 's important thinking regarding the " three represents " as the guide , constantly reforming , being brave in innovating , and industriously opening up a new page in military ideological and political work .  
As a matter of fact , it is impossible for the Chinese enterprises to head for the entire world without choice now .  We should first proceed from our own comparative advantages to select those regions that have their own comparative advantages , and make investment and set up factories there .  For instance , we should first gain access to the developing countries , the states of the former Soviet Union , the regions adjacent to West China , and so on .  
Meanwhile , along with the elimination of the feudal serf system , the cultural trait accompanying the old system that the Tibetan culture was monopolized by a tiny minority of serf owners will surely be " exterminated " ; and the old cultural autocracy featured by both an unification of the administration and the monastery and the dominance of region in Tibet 's entire social and political life will surely be eliminated .  This is a necessity in the development of the Tibetan history , and also a necessity in the development of the Tibetan culture .  
Adequately understanding the importance and urgency of cultural construction in line with the requirements of its 15th National Congress and from the height of the prosperity of the socialist cause and national rejuvenation is an important prerequisite for the entire party to better represent the advance orientation of China 's advanced culture .  
Of the two , advanced ideas and ethics as socialist ideology determine the nature of the entire culture , dominate its orientation of development , and impact and even lead the social , economic , and political progress as a whole .  They are the major representative and indicator of the entire culture .  
The increase in domestic and foreign demand stimulated comprehensive improvement in the production sector and enabled China 's entire economy to develop toward a good orientation .  The quality of economic performance improved steadily .

Maybe someone bought the wrong pills - - true , no one got seasick , but everyone became so drowsy that they spent the entire day sound asleep .  
To be sure , there is not a single naturalist writer who has not expressed great anguish at the rapid destruction of Taiwan 's environment . In fact , the entire field of naturalist literature has carried the responsibility of raising the environmental consciousness of Taiwan 's residents , and has therefore never been pure literary description .  
In order to accommodate the living habits of the village 's Saisiyat residents , Wu thought of incorporating the short spirit ceremony into the dance , and with that in mind in 1994 he specially attended the biannual ceremony at Sky Lake , where he taped the entire thing . He also spent time off from work to visit with Saisiyat elders and the parents of the students in order to get a firm grip on the meaning behind the ceremony .  
It 's just too bad that Du Fu did n't mention the dogs running around at the feet of the beautiful women . These canine companions might have been wearing red silk handkerchiefs or their entire bodies might even have been dyed the same color as their mistresses ' clothes .  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians . Nevertheless , the training process of veterinary medicine lacks a fitting understanding of canine population expansion .  
For the following 40 minutes , she is in her " former life , " crying , shouting , feeling numb , jerking and feeling hungry . Dr .

For a while now , Li Wen-ling , an elementary school teacher , has led her entire class in reading the classics during activity period . Because this was n't common in schools when she started , she had to play the hard and lonely role of pioneer . In addition to a few parents who looked askance on the activity , her students would ask why they had to recite when other kids did n't and would use the classical Chinese they had learned in class to attack her in their essay books .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
Looking back in history , the entire area starting from Taipei 's Po-ai District - - where the Presidential Palace and other national governmental buildings are located - - and radiating out to Taipei 's western and southern districts , used to be named Dajiala . In the earliest period of Taiwan history , it was said to be the hunting grounds of the Ketagalan and an official site for worshipping their ancestors .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .  
This , he says , deeply embarrassed Luo and was the cause of the bad blood between them . These explanations caused Luo , who really was out of the country , to become the prime suspect . Upon his return , Luo immediately launched a counter-offensive , charging that the entire kidnapping was just a stunt cooked up by Liao himself , and that the note was written with the intent of casting suspicion on Luo .  
Lin Yu-ping went the island to observe the troupe . Liu says that upon striking the drum , the whole wooden classroom resonated as if the room itself had been struck . The resultant sound , he recounts , can not be described as music , nor as rhythm , but rather as a direct assault upon one 's body , which " awakens your entire being . " The visitor is quite shaken by the experience .  
Tall and handsome , young and enchanting , they nevertheless frequently go through an entire year without seeing the light of day . They sleep during the day and go out at night . They live only indoors , underneath light-bulbs , and for this reason , when one pays close attention to them , their faces always seem a little pale , their voices are scratchy , and faint bags can be seen under their eyes . . . .  
Chen Hung-wei , a journalism student at Chengchi University , began to play the Japanese version of " The Three Kingdoms , " a game incorporating Chinese history and military strategy , two years ago . Not knowing Japanese did n't stop him from enjoying the game ; he spent the entire summer vacation after his freshman year attacking cities , invading countries and opening up the borderlands , often playing all night long .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Busy for an entire evening , despite wearing gloves , boots , and hats , crew members working in the freezer hold still end up with frosty eyebrows , hair , and beards , and they are tired and hungry . After a hurried breakfast , they fall asleep in their clothes as the deep purple night turns into an orange-red dawn .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Studies abroad suggest that adult sexual problems such as exposure , fetishes , impotence , or premature ejaculation are all related to repression of sexuality in early childhood .

Chunghsing Village was modeled after English communities . Over 40 years ago , it was unique in Taiwan for its waste water treatment and rain water drainage systems , its specially planted camphor trees , bodhi trees , and assorted grasses and plants , giving the entire village plentiful greenery and shade .  
To avoid having their shares sold off , these tycoons , who were such able stock market operators when the economy was sound , had to devote their firm 's entire resources to defending their share price . This made it difficult to employ their capital effectively-they lived and died with the market .  
Before the war , he only hunted animals , or perhaps would take part in an occasional " headhunting ceremony . " In either case , he acted on his own behalf , or at most on behalf of his tribe in times of armed conflict with neighboring tribes . After the war broke out , though , he was acting on behalf of the entire nation . The sacrifices he made were for a society that extended far beyond the confines of his tribe , and his actions took on a totally different significance .  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions .

The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
Master Hongyi is the fourth major work that Siong Leng has put on since 1993 . The story line departs significantly from the typical love stories featured in most nanguan works , and Siong Leng also breaks significant new musical ground by moving beyond the standard four instruments ( pipa , dongxiao , sanxian , and erxian ) to include an entire Chinese orchestra . The group also parts from tradition by incorporating folk dances into the play .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
In response to Lin 's accusations , Chiou I-jen , director of Chen 's national election campaign headquarters , said that Lin was engaged in slander pure and simple . In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
Perhaps these are mere technical problems . Even more important however , is that , in this model in which one exam decided a person 's entire life , the instinct for choice was lost . The prerequisite of choice is thinking , and in an environment where we accepted everything as given , we unwittingly abandoned our ability to think !  
With his enthusiastic and unselfish personality , Lin has been collaborating with grateful artists in this way for 20 happy years . In the process he has amassed an entire storehouse full of ceramic works-a veritable museum of ceramics-without paying a single cent .  
The only people allowed to fly in or out of Kinmen were senior military officials and persons in need of emergency medical treatment . A Kinmen native living in Taipei had to first spend two entire working days completing the paperwork , then take a day traveling by train to the southern port of Kaohsiung . From there the traveler boarded a military landing craft for a choppy trip back home lasting more than ten hours .  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
From halfway up the mountain , the entire valley is visible . Looking up , one sees birds of prey circling . The dead acacia stands erect in the midst of a green forest halfway up the slope . When the wind blows , it exposes the silver back side of the leaves of the surrounding trees , and the dead acacia stands out still more clearly .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo , Singapore and Hong Kong , and it has cities like Shanghai , Beijing , and Bangkok running fast on its heels , " says Chen . Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years . It was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network .  
Worst-hit were low-lying districts such as Kushan and Sanmin , where the waters rose to cover the entire first-floor level . In all , 3600 buildings throughout the city were swamped . Underground parking-lots became underground reservoirs , and flooded transformer boxes blew out , cutting off electricity and water supplies to many buildings . In one dreadful incident , someone actually drowned while trying to get downstairs by elevator .  
In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
This happened during a leadership class when O-Young left the trail and fell behind the group in order to photograph some beautiful mountain scenery . Trying to catch up , he did what he was accustomed to do in Taiwan : he took a shortcut . When he came out ahead of the instructor , he was feeling mighty pleased with himself , only to be rebuked by the entire team .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
The plants were thereafter propagated to produce enough for entire plantations . Thanks to the cool and fresh climate , the plentiful rain , the fertile soil , and the warm sunshine during the day , the Tungting area offers ideal conditions for growing tea bushes .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens . The cafe would be filled with movie-going students , some of whom would order a single cup of coffee and stay an entire afternoon , and whom the proprietors never felt right about asking to move on . After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
Compared to an intense volcanic eruption on land , when an entire mountain turns red and a huge cloud of smoke and debris rises up into the heavens , the eruptions around Penghu were much smaller . The effect was rather more like liquid flowing through cracks . The lava flowed through , covering up the area all around , forming into flat or low-gradient tablelands tens of meters deep called " mesas . "  
Looking to the future , Wu Torng-chuang says that most countries face similar problems : They must reduce reliance on price and export subsidies , and fall in with the logic of reducing barriers to imports . They must invest in basic infrastructure , specialized research , rural social services , and environmental protection . They may even need to restructure their entire agricultural sectors to meet changes in demand in the world market .  
Although this has been a bitter test , after six years of experience , Chuang Ming-yi and the entire community now feel a strong sense of mission . This major fire has only made them even more aware of how fast things can change , so they are even more determined to move forward .  
Protection of the local industry has become a leitmotif of the communist authorities ' video policy since 2000 . Fostered by the government , TV series have indeed seen rapid progress . Not only have they developed a distinct dramatic style native to China , they have also taken control of the viewership , and the high rate of return on investment is driving the development of the entire TV industry . Stations in every province are forming into groups that are capable of holding their own against the CCTV .  
With the growing number of single parent families and DINKs ( Double Income No Kids ) , modern people have a broader understanding and greater acceptance of what makes a home . What 's more , today 's young parents themselves have grown up in a freer atmosphere when the entire culture was changing .

" Parents should set their kids free , and not just so as to lighten the burdens on their kids , " Lu says . " In the past , while putting all their expectations on their kids , parents stifled their own potential for growth . " He discovered that many seniors felt bitter upon entering old age and discovering that they could not live close to their children . It affected their mental outlook for the entire latter period of their lives .

The dialogue in Hero was superficial and too modern sounding , and the film laid greater emphasis on form than the actual storyline . Moreover , director Zhang Yimou overextended himself attempting to confine so heavy and broad a theme within a two-hour format . As a result , the entire story comes off as a stiff and unnatural . Lacking in vitality , the characters are merely functional .  
Several older women , looking indescribably happy , start their hands and feet in perpetual motion , and in a short time the entire area has been completely cleaned , a gas stove has been set up , and vegetables have been washed and chopped . Before you know it , the aroma of fried rice-noodles begins to permeate the clinic site .  
The Estate is not the only structure closely connected to the history of Wufeng to be in this condition . The Wan Fo Temple , a busy religious center that was located in the mountains behind the provincial assembly building , was once the largest Buddhist monastery and temple complex in the entire rural township . Its most distinctive feature was a 20-meter tall golden statue of Baisajyagurvaiduryaprabhasa in a seated position . Though the statue itself is still intact , the remainder of the structure was eradicated by the earthquake .  
He once broke out with dermatitis while working on the eve of Chinese New Year .

Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
As the association 's executive director Huang Jui-chiang points out , the full 12-kilometer length of Highway 7C had been divided into 13 sections , each with their own name , which had long confused visitors from outside the area . Taking this into consideration , the county government proposed earlier this year to rename the entire highway " Parisa Road , " but this proposal met with strong opposition . Caught between a rock and a hard place , the county government decided to open the proposal to public submissions .  
Since that formative event in her childhood , Liu has devoted her entire life to loving and caring for all living things .

On occasions , she will even take the animal home and care for it .  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
Little Li Fu-huei , barely three years old , sits on her father 's lap reciting the 3000-odd-character-long essay by Zhuangzi , " Man in the World , Associated with Other Men .

"  
He displayed his deep understanding of life 's mysteries in his carving Intermingling Grief and Joy , in which an entire body , save the head , appeared to be melting . For the face , he carved his own image , with teary eyes , the top of his skull cut open , and a lotus blossom seemingly inserted in the opening . It clearly conveyed the great joy of transcendence of self that he had experienced at that moment .  
Mutouyu , located at the northernmost part of the Penghu islands , is comprised entirely of rocks , with reefs on all sides . It is strategically important terrain , but not one inch of grass grows on the entire island , and every time strong winds and waves rise up , it seems like a salty rain is falling . Every day the island is covered in a salt fog , with salt getting into your clothes and hair , making it very uncomfortable .  
One year , Kung planted his plots with a kind of mini-gourd , and the entire crop was hit by a mutation , causing the gourds to be more pear-shaped instead of their usual hourglass-like shape .

The seed company planted another row during summer , which produced gourds of the normal shape .

Because the sanctions regime , in practical terms , upsets the normal and balanced functioning of the economy of whole adjoining regions , undermining their entire economic infrastructure and rupturing external economic links , we need a mechanism for the careful consideration , before any decision is taken on imposing sanctions against any country , of the potential consequences of such a step both for the country targeted by the sanctions and for third countries .  
This statement of intent has changed nothing : the reality of the situation is that the sanctions imposed on Iraq have been continued as a means of collectively punishing an entire people , and the steps required from Iraq to end the sanctions have remained as vague as they have always been in the Council 's resolutions , as in paragraph 21 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , for instance .

The establishment of a strategy calling for a supple and coherent approach in relationships of partnership between NATO , the European Union , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations , where each has its own responsibilities , powers and ways of operating , is of vital importance to the entire matter of Euro-Atlantic security , with beneficial effects for the entire collective security system based on the United Nations Charter .  
Impartiality can not lead to progress if it means accepting the blocking of humanitarian convoys and of the delivery of fuel and other aid , in order to benefit the aims of conquest and siege , being resigned to entire units of UNPROFOR being taken hostage and informing those who have shelled hospitals in safe areas when and where the cosmetic or proportionate airstrike against an offending tank will take place .

While welcoming the meeting held in Tombouctou on 16 and 17 July 1995 between the Government of Mali and northern Mali 's development partners , the Ministers renewed their appeal to the entire international community to increase its material and financial support for the implementation of all the provisions of the National Pact and for the consolidation of the peace process under way in the country .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
At a time when a real chance for a just and lasting peace , which would satisfy the vital interests of all three peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina is at last within reach , it is essential that this opportunity should not be missed and that all measures be taken so that NATO air strikes which threaten to undermine the entire peace process are immediately stopped .

The estimated measurable loss on the basis of the unrealized social product , as well as of the unrealized net inflow of invisible transactions with foreign countries , and on the basis of the additional costs of the increased number of unemployed persons and refugees is US $ 147.3-billion for the entire 1991-2011 period - US $ 45.1-billion for the period 1991-1994 and US $ 102.2-billion for the period 1995-2011 .

Human rights action teams established by UNCRO , conducting on-site investigations , found " evidence of extrajudicial executions , disappearances , ill treatment , harassment and the systematic and widespread destruction of houses and entire villages carried out by members of the Croatian Army and internal security forces in Krajina against the remaining civilian population , mostly elderly men and women " .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .

The total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons , as an indispensable step towards general and complete disarmament under strict and efficient international control , is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement , to which we fully subscribe .

Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;

The entire operation , encompassing both the preparation of initial studies and the subsequent review and coordinating work , is , as indicated above , carried out with resources only available after more urgent tasks have been accomplished - a situation which is the result not of a deliberate decision but of necessity , inasmuch as the demands on the Secretariat units concerned are for the most part of a current nature and can not be subordinated to work on the Repertory ;  
We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
Urge all those involved in the implementation process to undertake urgent and effective measures to stop the tendency of ethnic partition of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and draw the attention of the international community to the serious threat to the stability of the entire Balkan region as a result of the prevailing tendency to support ethnic instead of democratic forces ;  
Given the deep and glaring involvement of the Government of the Sudan , as established by incontrovertible evidence presented on the international plane , in the entire conspiracy to assassinate the Egyptian Head of State , the latest smokescreen created by the Sudan defies all logic and borders on being so farcical that the Sudan will once again fail in its futile attempt to hoodwink international opinion .  
As long as more than one eighth of Lebanon is occupied and Israeli raids continue to blow up power stations , to interrupt daily life , to stifle the population with their aerial bombardment , killing women , children and the elderly before the eyes of the entire international community , the Security Council 's equating of aggressor and victim in its approach to Lebanon 's complaints will remain devoid of justice .  
Indeed , the English occupation in 1765 had been partial and precarious ; the fact that they had left tangible signs of possession to indicate their intention of returning could not constitute a legal claim that was more compelling than the continuous , effective and peaceful exercise of State sovereignty over the entire archipelago for many years .  
In this regard , on Friday , 23 August , the Government published a statement in which it invites the entire international community , starting with Amnesty International , to immediately begin investigations of this monstrous allegation by the representative of Amnesty International in Burundi .

Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
Since such an environmental holocaust would affect countries of the North and South alike , it behoved the entire international community to marshal every iota of political will to address the pressing universal environmental concerns for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The main difficulty in controlling illicit drugs was that well-organized , well-financed and closely-knit criminal cartels had flexible mechanisms , were capable of threatening entire States and did not hesitate to corrupt officials in order to reach their goals .  
The occupation of others territory ; widespread and massive violation of basic human rights , including the right to self-determination ; the forceful imposition of the will of one over the entire region through coercion , intimidation and official state terrorism ; the disruption of regional security and stability ; arms race ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; the rejection of the demands of the international community ; and even the violation of commitments willingly undertaken under the so-called peace process constitute the main causes of the Middle East crisis .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .

While it was true that fees for courts and lawyers were higher than the average Kenyan might be able to afford , this problem was economic in nature and could best be solved by development projects geared to raising the standards of living of the entire citizenry .  
However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .

The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .

We must express our gratitude to all our compatriots , to our friends abroad and to the entire Ukrainian community , whose understanding and support were a sturdy pillar , a powerful force driving the constitutional process .

Accordingly , when we constantly stress the overriding need for compliance with the principle of parallelism between the sale of petroleum and the provision of the food , medicine and other humanitarian needs included in the procurement and distribution plan , we do so for sound legal and logical reasons , since the proceeds from the sale of petroleum is to be used to purchase supplies with a view to distributing them quickly to the entire population of Iraq , thereby ensuring that all the elements of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are implemented simultaneously .

This being the situation , delegations and groups of delegations have to be accommodating to the extent possible so as to facilitate the efficient and meaningful functioning of the Conference , bearing in mind that it has a responsibility towards the entire international community , which is a task well beyond serving the national interests of the Conference 's membership .

It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Given the noble and legitimate aspirations of the entire international community for the future of the planet , the Organization certainly needs to be renewed in order to confront effectively and successfully the exciting yet disturbing challenges posed by globalization .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .

It was the Israeli decision to build a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem that constituted its latest attempt at pre-empting the outcome of negotiations on the final status , by trying to change the legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem , a city which is of central importance for not only the Arab world but also the entire Muslim world , being the first Kiblah and the third Holy City of Islam , and for all three major religions , as well as for the international community . 
In the context which I have just outlined , my country believes that the best chance we have here today to begin work which can produce rapid and concrete results which are understandable and expected by the entire international community lies in establishing as soon as possible an ad hoc committee to negotiate a comprehensive ban on anti _ personnel mines by means of a step _ by _ step approach .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
Given the central importance of Jerusalem to the Palestinian people , to the entire Arab and Muslim nation , to the followers of the three monotheistic religions and to the international community as a whole , the Council 's inaction stands in stark contrast to the collective position of the international community , as reflected in the Council , the great potential damage of Israel 's decision , its impact on the Middle East peace process , and the great harm wrought by the failure of the Council to adopt this draft resolution .

We are also grateful to the entire international community for rendering invaluable assistance to Tajikistan at the critical stage of the formation of its statehood and of the foundations for the normal functioning of civilian society .  
While the situation of human rights in Croatia had been improving constantly since the end of the conflict and since the Croatian Governments establishment of control over the entire territory of Croatia , and while that situation had definitely improved in Bosnia and Herzegovina , it had worsened in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , where numerous conflicts had broken out and there had been a renewed outbreak of human rights violations .

Shocked and horrified by ongoing massacres and other brutal action in Kosovo with the intent of ethnic cleansing , in clear violation of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law and resulting in the needless loss of lives and a massive humanitarian tragedy affecting the entire region ,  
The suggestion of the Commissions Working Group on the topic to delete any reference to the nature or purpose of State activities in determining whether the activities should be considered commercial transactions , and thus subject to the internal jurisdiction of another State , touched upon one of the most controversial points in the entire draft .  
The two sides consider that the creation , in violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 , of a national anti-ballistic-missile defence system by one of the States which signed that Treaty will have a destructive effect on strategic stability and on the entire structure of key international agreements relating to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery , and will mar prospects for achieving further progress in these directions .

The human suffering caused by the accident can not be measured , and its environmental impact was partly irreversible .  
My delegation remains convinced that an independent East Timor , established in democratic pluralism based on the national pact referred to by Mr . Ramos-Horta , should be assisted by the United Nations and the entire international community .  
In this regard , we call on the Security Council and the international community to redouble their efforts to convince the Government of Iraq to be more forthcoming and positive in addressing this issue and to resolve the entire matter on humanitarian , religious and moral grounds and in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions .  
However , we strongly believe that the dynamic of the entire peace process can be maintained and moved forward only if the responsibilities and the political will of the parties is fulfilled and translated into real action .  
Despite Afghanistans slide into chaos in recent years , and the dangerous and destabilizing implications that that has had for the subregion and elsewhere , the international community still has an essential moral duty not to condemn the entire Afghan people for the mistakes of an authority that has been isolated within the country and has made enemies of much of the rest of the world by turning that country into a base camp for an international terrorist network .  
Finally , I would like to express our fervent hope that through the joint efforts of the two parties , assisted by the international community , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be ultimately resolved so that peace will return to the entire Middle East region and the peoples of Palestine and Israel will enjoy living side by side in their own countries , secure in peace , prosperity and dignity .

In addition to the national reports of Governments on the follow-up to individual conferences , the resident coordinators annual report , prepared in close collaboration with the entire country team , continued in 2000 to be an important source of information on actual inter-agency activities relating to conference follow-up at the country level .

Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of the Government of Iraq to ensure the well-being of its entire population and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , concerned about the dire situation in Iraq , which affects the population , in particular children , as stated in the reports of several United Nations human rights treaty bodies , and appealing to all concerned to fulfil their mutual obligations in the management of the humanitarian programme established by the Security Council in its resolution 986 ( 1995 ) ,  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .

They especially appreciated the fact that the concept put forward by the Secretary-General that we must put people at the centre of everything we do was strongly reflected in the United Nations Millennium Declaration ; the Summits reference to the United Nations as the indispensable common house of the entire human family ; and its wish to make the United Nations system a more vital and effective tool in the hands of all the worlds peoples .  
Such a system would remove the problem of pet projects with questionable rationale and uncertain funding , support the consistent quality of project document preparation and ensure the corporate ownership of the entire scope of operational activities .  
In the Millennium Declaration , the heads of State and Government of the States Members of the United Nations pledged to spare no effort to free our fellow men , women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty , to which more than a-billion of them are currently subjected and expressed their commitment to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want ( General Assembly resolution 55 / 2 of 8 September 2000 , para . 
We look forward to strong leadership by Governments , and concerted efforts with full and active participation of the United Nations , the entire multilateral system , civil society , the business community and private sector ;  
Fearing that the security situation may deteriorate further , become irreparable and pose a danger of the entire region and wishing the Palestinian people to be protected from Israels grievous methods of repression , the 56 member States decided to urge the Security Council to meet and to adopt resolutions that would provide international protection for the Palestinian people and avert the dangers of brutal Israeli aggression against it . 
Particularly distressing is the felling of precious varieties of trees and forests protected under the endangered species list ( Red Book ) of Georgia , and the contraband of same outside the State borders , which causes irreversible damage to the unique ecosystems of the entire region .  
We have seen how such major issues facing the international community as , among others , the nuclear weapons reduction process , CTBT and the negotiation of a BWC protocol have come up against unwarranted challenges : it is very likely that weapons and weapon systems will be introduced into outer space ; while last year the entire international community , including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , recognized the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone of global stability , this year we hear voices calling for the total abrogation of this treaty .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
In addition and this , too , is a serious matter through the technology of the communications media , which showed the entire world live and direct the distressing images from New York , Washington and Pennsylvania , an entire generation of children and adolescents has been marked by fear and insecurity ; unable to find reasons , they ask themselves why these inhuman acts occurred and what kind of future awaits them .  
It is an act that flagrantly violated a basic , fundamental right on which is based the functioning and entire legal , political , moral and religious structure of our societies and of human coexistence : respect for the right to life of every human being . 
Kyrgyzstan would like to see the future Afghanistan as a peaceful , neutral and friendly State and also holds the view that it is necessary to ensure in that country the international conditions needed for carrying out the Afghan settlement process on a peaceful basis and achieving national reconciliation by setting up a broad-based , effective coalition government that reflects the interests of the entire Afghan people and maintains good-neighbourly relations with neighbouring States .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
He believes that a critical objective of the entire process of institutional reform must be an effective separation of legislative , executive and judicial powers with human rights and the rule of law as its foundation .

There was no doubt that the brutal imposition of comprehensive sanctions , exacting vengeance on an entire people , were a continuing flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter , of international law and of international humanitarian law .  
The events of 11 September and the angry or opportunistic reactions that followed them , including the brutal aggression against Afghanistan based on a suspicion and the accompanying innuendos and statements emanating from the media or from officials , both American and non-American , have shown that the entire world could be set ablaze by a spark from the West , even one coming from beyond the Atlantic .  
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;  
While the emergence of a broad-based and representative government through an inclusive participatory process may take some time , the failure to take the initial interim measures promptly , to meet urgent security needs and to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance could well jeopardize the entire process .  
Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
Consequently , the entire range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , are relevant to intellectual property systems .  
While that great collective task which mobilized the entire international community would , of course , require human and material resources , it would also require strengthened international assistance for the implementation of environmental protection conventions and promotion of a new global partnership and a new social ethic that must be the goal and the aspiration of the Johannesburg Summit .
