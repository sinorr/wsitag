They must have a fine style of work , maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support .  In this way , we can faithfully carry out well the sacred mission entrusted by the motherland and the people .  
Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .

We were at first worried that the Taiwan authorities would gloat over and revel in the recent US arms deal and the diplomatic victory of Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan . However , we are glad to hear that , after taking the above situations into consideration , the Presidential Office has announced in its statement today that arms purchase is not the only means of guaranteeing Taiwan 's defense , that the two sides of the Strait could only be assured genuine and lasting peace through constructive dialog and the normalization of relations .  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou yesterday told Hong Kong 's elite and international figures that the people of Hong Kong are assured under " one country , two systems , " and he is pleased to see the successful implementation of " one country , two systems " in Hong Kong . However , he added that Taiwan 's historical conditions and political situation are different from those of Hong Kong , so , if " one country , two systems " is compellingly implemented in Taiwan , the people of Taiwan will feel resentful .  
Although the small number of " Taiwan independence " elements have made frequent clamor and trouble in a bid to separate Taiwan from China 's territory , under the condemnation of the entire Chinese people they are now like rats running across the street and are also spurned by the international community ; they are now in a dead-end , and their fated defeat has long been assured .

But even with all these , success is far from assured . This is because the ocean floor is littered with artillery shell fragments and other metallic junk that create numerous obstacles to searching , so it is still necessary to have divers go over the ocean floor using the naked eye and a fine tooth comb .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
The magazine 's reporting was based on the underlying premise that " sex is scandalous , " and the Hsu sisters ' agent put on a vigorous " damage control " campaign and assured the public that the sisters never took Ecstasy or had sex . The two sides engaged in a furious round of accusations and denials , but one thing they did agree on was that sex is a dirty word . It was all oddly out of character for a couple of girls whose stock-in-trade was their image of being rebellious and outlandish .

Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
Moreover , whether they were consultative or jurisdictional , national institutions must be based on the highest possible legal standard , which assured their legitimacy , so that they would be able to ensure the synergy between the State and civil society .  
Jamaica , therefore , supported recommendation 6 of the Secretary-General 's report ( A / 50 / 202 ) which called for the re-energizing of negotiations on a new , improved funding system in accordance with resolution 48 / 162 , which had called for a substantial increase in funding required for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis .

Even more serious , the " ABM Treaty " is built on the basis of the theory of relative security ; it brought about relative balance of US and Soviet nuclear offensive and defensive forces through " mutually assured destruction " and prevented either side from carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike , while the US NMD is aimed at achieving its unilateral absolute military superiority and absolute security .

We were at first worried that the Taiwan authorities would gloat over and revel in the recent US arms deal and the diplomatic victory of Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan . However , we are glad to hear that , after taking the above situations into consideration , the Presidential Office has announced in its statement today that arms purchase is not the only means of guaranteeing Taiwan 's defense , that the two sides of the Strait could only be assured genuine and lasting peace through constructive dialog and the normalization of relations .  
Whether or not cross-strait military strength is balanced is a major basis for the United States in deciding on arms sales to Taiwan ; when the mainland bought 10 Su-27s , the United States could sell 20 F-16s to Taiwan , and this trial of strength between spear and shield will continue , because the United States believes that regional security can be assured so long as relative balance is maintained in cross-strait military strength .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou yesterday told Hong Kong 's elite and international figures that the people of Hong Kong are assured under " one country , two systems , " and he is pleased to see the successful implementation of " one country , two systems " in Hong Kong . However , he added that Taiwan 's historical conditions and political situation are different from those of Hong Kong , so , if " one country , two systems " is compellingly implemented in Taiwan , the people of Taiwan will feel resentful .  
Although the small number of " Taiwan independence " elements have made frequent clamor and trouble in a bid to separate Taiwan from China 's territory , under the condemnation of the entire Chinese people they are now like rats running across the street and are also spurned by the international community ; they are now in a dead-end , and their fated defeat has long been assured .

But even with all these , success is far from assured . This is because the ocean floor is littered with artillery shell fragments and other metallic junk that create numerous obstacles to searching , so it is still necessary to have divers go over the ocean floor using the naked eye and a fine tooth comb .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
The magazine 's reporting was based on the underlying premise that " sex is scandalous , " and the Hsu sisters ' agent put on a vigorous " damage control " campaign and assured the public that the sisters never took Ecstasy or had sex . The two sides engaged in a furious round of accusations and denials , but one thing they did agree on was that sex is a dirty word . It was all oddly out of character for a couple of girls whose stock-in-trade was their image of being rebellious and outlandish .

Since sufficient grant resources have not been forthcoming on a voluntary , predictable and assured basis to support operational activities at the level required , consideration needs to be given to a funding system which would place operational activities on a more viable basis .  
Moreover , whether they were consultative or jurisdictional , national institutions must be based on the highest possible legal standard , which assured their legitimacy , so that they would be able to ensure the synergy between the State and civil society .  
Jamaica , therefore , supported recommendation 6 of the Secretary-General 's report ( A / 50 / 202 ) which called for the re-energizing of negotiations on a new , improved funding system in accordance with resolution 48 / 162 , which had called for a substantial increase in funding required for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis .
