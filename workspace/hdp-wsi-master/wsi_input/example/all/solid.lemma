Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .

Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .

Nevertheless , it should also be noticed that some leading cadres still do not have sufficient understanding about the importance of ideological and political work and that they grasp economic work in a relatively solid way but grasp the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization in a relatively vague way .  
We should make full use of these favorable conditions , adhere to the mass line , fulfill the work amid the actual activities of the material and spiritual productions of the masses of the people , let ideological education run through the handling of solid affairs , and guide the masses to enhance their spiritual realm through resolving realistic problems .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .

We must prevent trouble before it appears , must eliminate the wrong thing as soon as they begin to crop up , must not allow them to spread unchecked or swell viciously , must not allow them to confuse people 's minds and disrupt our overall situation .

An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .
