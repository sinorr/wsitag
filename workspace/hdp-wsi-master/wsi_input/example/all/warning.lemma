Influenced by the rain water from the upper reaches area and Dongting Lake hydrographic net , since late August , the water levels at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtse River mainstream lower than Shishou rose higher than the warning water level in succession .  
The leader of the project , Dai Sirui , from Southwest Agricultural University , said the project involved the study and demonstration of key technologies of people 's working and living , ecological problems , city waste water and garbage disposal , landslide monitoring warning , pasture and husbandry sectors ' development , advantageous and unique sector 's development , and ecological and economic system reconstruction after the Three Gorges Dam conserved water .  
The director of the East China Sea Section of the State Oceanic Administration , Zhang Youfen , said red tide is a common incident in the international marine environment .  Its impacts can be confined to the smallest scope if strict monitoring , warning and precautionary measures are taken .  Any panic is unnecessary .  
Article 40 For the enterprise responsible for printing the renminbi and relevant personnel that have one of the following conditions , the People 's Bank of China will issue a warning , confiscate their profits obtained illegally , and impose on them a fine equivalent to between one and three times the value of the obtained illegal profits .  Those that do not have illicit gains will be fined between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
After studying the case , it was decided that he should be given inter-party warning as a punishment and his work position should be readjusted .  At the same time , relevant leaders in his unit were investigated and affixed the responsibility of dereliction of duty , an office-level leader who was assigned personal responsibility was instructed to write a written examination , and inter-party warning was given as punishment to a department-level cadre who is specifically responsible for the job of sorting out the housing problem .  
After reporting it to the provincial party committee and obtaining its approval , the Qinghai Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee gave Hualong County Party Committee Secretary Liu Shuheng , who bore the principal leadership responsibility , a serious warning as a measure of party discipline and removed him from the post of county party committee secretary and punished other responsible personnel involved with party disciplinary actions and administrative punishments .  
Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Third , we must make preparations ahead of time , guarding against and dispelling in a timely manner the risk of imbalances in our international balance of payments which may result from bringing in foreign capital improperly , and we should also enhance our oversight and advance warning regarding foreign capital flow , strengthening our statistical analysis of the international balance of payments .  
During the " yichi . focal lens 99 " exercise , the US troops used its most advanced simulation system and automated command system .  For instance , it used for the first time the simulated environmental technology for airforce reconnaissance and monitoring and the most advanced long-range air to surface monitoring system installed in E-8C airborne early warning aircraft to provide target data to the exercising troops , thus greatly improving the simulation effects of a computerized battlefield .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
The Cheng Kejie case has exposed the weak links in our work , yet it has also given us a profound warning concerning our work : It is necessary to severely punish corrupt elements ; yet viewing from the angle of resisting corruption and guarding against moral degeneration , it is of a greater importance to impose strict education , strict control , and strict supervision on party-member leading cadres .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
This division proceeded from the reality of its capacity for anti-air-raids with existing equipment , and comprehensively deployed all kinds of radar and optical observation instruments it had to form a well-conceived antiaircraft reconnaissance system with multiple reconnaissance networks and an " integrated multi-network early warning " system , thus enabling " all units were informed about the information obtained by any unit . "  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
Showing the entire process of the operation of Air Force radar units , including rapid deployment , line erection , combat warning , rush repairs , and troop withdrawal , this war game , which was close to actual combat , served to display the high mobility of our radar units in the face of the " soft " and " hard " antipersonnel forces of the " enemy " under actual-combat conditions , as well as their capabilities to accurately and rapidly discover and handle enemy movements .  
Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
Xiong Mingfeng ( research fellow of Strategy department of Military Science College ) : Suppose the interception process starts with the launch of missiles by the enemy ; sensors in space first discover and report that a threatening launch has occurred , and then the national defense support satellites and space-based infrared system issue a warning of potential danger from this missile launch , and guide the radar to activate the " search grid " ; when enemy missiles are discovered , the combat control center commences rapid assessment of the interception plan .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
After comprehensively completing a project aimed at integrating an " air network " information system with a " ground network " information system , which is being relentlessly pursued by the US Government , the US strategic early warning system is expected to have plugged up all its loopholes , and by that time , the United States is likely to become the most perilous source of war in its capacity as the sole space-dominating power . 
The above two different early warning systems are known as " the air-based early warning system " and " the ground-based air target surveillance and tracking system " , respectively , with the former is formed mainly by the DSP satellite system , which is capable of sounding an early warning against an incoming missile , or its future replacement - - " the air-based infrared surveillance system " , and the latter by seven key early warning systems operated by the US Air Force Space Command and the US Navy Space Command , respectively . 
However , since the DSP satellites are unable to effectively sound an early warning against an incoming tactical ballistic missile , are excessively dependent on a ground station , and are likely to sound a false alarm , and even an alarm in case of fire , the US Defense Department eventually decided in 1995 to phase out the DSP system and substitute it with an " air-based infrared early warning system " called SBIRS .  
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .  
Besides , the NWS is also assisted by a short-range early warning line called " the pine line " , which is located 49 degrees north latitude in the northernmost of the United States , running through Canada 's east coast and west coast . 
In the new century , China and Japan should , on the basis of the spirit of " taking a warning from history and looking forward to the future " and the principle determined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship , and Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , continue to hold the overall bilateral relationship from strategic and historical heights , eliminate disturbances , and overcome obstacles ; and to work hard to open up a new aspect of good neighborliness , friendship , and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
1 .  To coordinate the process of joining the WTO , Taiwan should decontrol direct cross-strait trade and direct postal and telecommunications services , and , considering the Mainland 's moves to lower its trade barriers , appropriately increase and open up Mainland imports .  Meanwhile , Taiwan should also plan to set up an " early warning system governing cross-strait trade security " to take charge of affairs relevant to national security and industrial risks .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
Member Wang Daming suggested that the CPPCC step up its democratic supervision and strive to curb corruptive practices .  In spite of the fact that such supervision does not carry the legal force for mandatory compliance or disciplinary restraint , it nevertheless can play a guiding , warning , suppression and publicity role .  When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .

When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .  
Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
China is a peace-loving country which has mainly developed her self-defense national defense on her own .  In the meantime , China has also conducted some cooperation with the countries concerned .  Originally , China had signed with Israel an agreement on purchasing an aircraft equipped with an early warning radar on the basis of normal military trade relations between the two countries .  
It successively formulated regulations for prevention , admonition , warning , and penalties .  Various supervision measures were combined properly and implemented comprehensively .  Through more intensive ideological education , stricter internal supervision inside the leading bodies , effective organizational adjustments , and serious handling of problems and cases , the sense of self-discipline among leading cadres was raised and the effectiveness of organizational supervision was also enhanced .  
In connection with the realistic conditions of their work , a number of departments , including the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , the Central Financial Work Committee , the State Economic and Trade Commission , and the General Administration of Customs , have respectively issued special circulars in the light of concrete problems existing in their own sector , and have called for vigorous efforts to ensure a sound implementation of the warning education .  
Efforts should be taken to make the warning education a success , for it is a major content of our current efforts to strengthen the ideological and political work and it has a close inherent link with the task of thoroughgoingly conducting the " three-stresses " education .  
Recently , to allow " information to be commonly shared " and enhance our three-dimensional penetrating ability in gathering information from across the strait , the Ministry of National Defense even merged the three services ' intelligence collection systems and streamlined the information transmission methods to enliven the armed forces ' coast-based systems of early warning , wartime command , observation , communication , search for carrier terminals , and reconnaissance , thus establishing a very careful entity as well as a mobile and flexible reconnaissance and communication system .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
" Related sectors " indicated that Taiwan 's current economic warning signals undoubtedly reflect fundamental problems and , even more so , elements of political unrest .  These elements have had a negative psychological impact that resulted in numerous economic measures failing to immediately achieve their expected results .  The fundamental policy of " long-term accumulation of short-term blows " caused a mutually destructive situation that was definitely not the people 's good fortune .  
It was reported that a US technical officer emphasized to an official of our National Defense Ministry who accompanied the visiting group that a higher degree of camouflage was necessary to protect long-range early warning radars against the mainland China ballistic missile threat .  In this regard we have increased the budget earmarked for camouflage works .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
New arrangements for the warning of heavy rain , including a revised rainstorm warning system , the termination of the flood warning , and the introduction of special announcements on flooding in the northern New Territories , will be implemented for the coming rain season , the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory , Dr H K Lam , announced today ( Thursday ) .  
The Code lays down detailed requirements on how to handle obscene and indecent materials transmitted via the Internet . These include requiring members of the Association to take appropriate measures to prevent Internet users from placing or transmitting obscene material on the Internet and to block access to the problematic Web site if necessary .  Regarding indecent material suitable for adults only , the Code requires local content providers and distributors to include in the Web page concerned a warning that such material is not suitable for publication to persons under the age of 18 .  
Motorists should avoid driving in hilly areas until the rain has eased off while pedestrians should avoid walking or standing close to steep slopes or retaining walls , especially those posted with warning signs , " the Acting Head of the GEO , Mr John Massey , said .  
Motorists should avoid driving in hilly areas until the rain has eased off while pedestrians should avoid walking or standing close to a steep slope or retaining wall , especially those posted with warning signs .  
Starting from tomorrow ( April 1 ) , the day the Road Traffic ( Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles ) ( Amendment ) Regulation 2000 takes effect , all goods vehicles will be required to be fitted with an automatic device capable of giving audible and sufficient warning when they are reversing or are about to reverse .  
Although Hong Kong has not yet established a formal CERC , the normal supporting services of a CERC have , to a certain extent , been provided by the Information Technology Services Department ( ITSD ) and other industrial support organisations like the Hong Kong Productivity Council ( HKPC ) .  These include the issue of warning alert and dissemination of information on the emergence of new computer virus through the media or their web sites , and the provision of advisory services on how the virus should be properly tackled .  
As regards buildings , the Buildings Ordinance requires mandatory provision of barrier-free access and other facilities in buildings for people with disabilities , details of which are laid down in a Design Manual . Examples of the mandatory requirements include wheelchair spaces in public auditoria , toilet and water closet cubicles for the disabled , induction loop system for hearing impaired persons , tactile warning strips at both top and bottom ends of staircases for visually impaired persons , etc .  
" The reversal in the crime trend is in large a result of measure taken under the CCB 's approach which led to successful prosecutions of cases handled by the Bureau , sending a warning to those who consider engaging in the illicit trade .  " In addition to enhanced sentences for prevalent offence under the OSCO , companies with dubious or allegedly uttered accounts may be required to produce material concerning their business upon the issue of an order under section 4 of the same ordinance , " the spokesman said .  
What is more , manned emergency 24-hour telephone hotlines will be set up during amber warning rainstorm or above , together with essential standby plant and labour , so that blockages to river flow due to accumulated debris / municipal wastes can be dealt with and cleared at the earliest possible time .  
In the past few years , the Administration has introduced a number of safety measures for school buses , which included the compulsory requirement of an adult escort for all school buses carrying primary and kindergarten pupils , the installation of public address system and warning devices at doors and emergency exit doors of school buses and school light buses , and the adoption of a brighter colour scheme for new school light buses to make them more conspicuous .  
Any HA employee found to have committed such acts may be subject to disciplinary actions under HA 's prevailing human resources policy , ranging from verbal or written warning to dismissal from service .  
The special flag-raising ceremony scheduled to be held at 8 am will be cancelled owing to either thunderstorm warning , red rainstorm warning , black rainstorm warning , No . 3 typhoon signal , No . 8 typhoon signal , No . 9 typhoon signal or No . 10 typhoon signal .  
As the Hong Kong Observatory issued the very hot weather warning today ( July 6 ) , the Department of Health ( DH ) advised members of the public , particularly those engaged in outdoor activities , to take measures to prevent heat stroke in view of the prevailing hot weather .  
Its characteristic vice was also its greatest virtue : because it devoured anything it came upon , even evil spirits avoided it , and the Chinese considered it auspicious . Its fearsome features often appear on ancient bronze or ceramic dining vessels - - as a warning against overindulgence as well as a charm against evil .  
Preventive planning and control of hazardous wastes will be instituted and an environmental quality monitoring network set up in order to provide accurate warning and instant response . The Taiwan area will then live up to its reputation of being a beautiful island with blue skies and green meadows , verdant mountains and clear waters . .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
Before the tour began , Foundation workers checked that all the bicycles ' tires were well pumped up , their brakes properly adjusted , their handlebars secure and their saddles at the right height , and they accompanied the tour in a small van carrying repair tools and two spare bikes . The children 's cycles and those of the three tour leaders were equipped with long red warning flags .  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
Many Lives , Many Masters , a book about hypnosis and past lives by an American psychiatrist , and stage performances by Western hypnotists here have stirred up a Taiwanese craze for hypnosis . They have also elicited widely divergent reactions , from the awestruck to the contemptuous , from the open-minded to the dismissive . Some have jumped at chances to be hypnotized themselves ; others have blown bugle calls of warning against what they perceive as a menace .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
In fact , with reference to existing prenatal diagnostic techniques for genetic disorders , the ROC Department of Health has issued administrative orders warning doctors that conducting fetal gender tests on pregnant women , or performing abortions based on the fetal gender , would make them guilty of malpractice under the Medical Practice Law and the Medical Treatment Law . But there are still gynecology clinics whose signboards blatantly carry such wording as " CVS testing , 100% accurate . "  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
At its most severe , cases of serious crime or crimes causing major damage or injury usually find the perpetrators given a sentence in a juvenile detention center . Other offenders might be placed in a juvenile reformatory and training school as in cases of theft or robbery . Youths charged in connection with altercations or fights might be sentenced to probation or weekend guidance . Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
" Most people respond to a major trauma by trying to push the experience out of their conscious mind . The trauma is never spoken of and is only recognized through the symptoms the victim displays , " says Dr . Chang Ta-jen , assistant director of the Provincial Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . Chang says that as most people are unable to recognize the warning signs and symptoms , they deal with a trauma by repressing it or through displacement .  
But unlike these resilient structures , many newly-built apartment blocks came crashing down completely without warning . Many anomalies such as concertinaed individual storeys , rebars ( reinforcing bars ) pulled clean and straight out of the bases of columns , rebars snapped through like dry spaghetti , and even the joints between beams and columns filled out with cooking-oil cans , were reported to the world by the international media , to the shame of Taiwan 's construction industry .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
The innkeeper could only shake his head and watch as Wu wobbled off up the road . After a while Wu passed an official notice warning about the tiger , and realized that the innkeeper had spoken the truth . He considered turning round but then thought better of it , worried that he 'd look stupid if he went back to the inn .  
To be fair , this time around government agencies at every level were unstinting in their rescue efforts , communication and command systems worked well , and the response was swift . The problem was that the disaster covered such a vast area and came so quickly . Many mudslides and flash floods came with little or no warning , so that people could only watch helplessly as their loved ones were swallowed up or swept away , to be parted from them forever .  
Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 . The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by the time it passed over land that evening , but no sooner had the typhoon warning been lifted than the ensuing weather system unleashed a torrential downpour on Kaohsiung , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history .  
Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
For example , " amniotic fluid embolism " is a dangerous obstetric emergency that can occur without any prior warning or symptoms , and may cause the sudden death of a mother during or after labor . Kao Tien-fu , a director of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the ROC and convener of its medical disputes committee , has encountered two cases , and sadly was unable to save either of the women .  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
Yu used to hold down multiple jobs that kept him racing every day between the hospital , television station , radio station , and newspaper . For years he woke up brutally early to do radio and TV shows , stumbling home dead beat well after sundown . He developed a gastrointestinal problem that often left him doubled over in pain without any advance warning .  
After the SARS warning was issued , people who had been in a SARS area or who had had contact with anyone or anything having to do with SARS , were classified as " suspected " cases if they developed a fever . If they had abnormal chest radiographs ( showing whitish spots indicating the accumulation of white blood cells and body secretions ) they were classified as " probable " cases .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .  
In this increasingly competitive era , instrumental values like drive , ability to work independently , and professional knowledge are given the greatest weight by society . The media and publishing industry have been warning young people to get themselves geared up for the economic struggles ahead . But amidst all the talk of instrumental values , you have to wonder : Whatever happened to dreams , those things that make life so exciting and worthwhile ?  
As motor-scooter riders themselves , they started from their own experience of often being dazzled by the high beams of car headlights that prevent one from seeing the road ahead clearly . The team had the idea of installing a warning device to remind drivers behind to dip their lights . They combined it with a reversing alert to give a warning if the vehicle ahead backs up , and a turn signal canceling device to automatically switch off the indicator after the scooter has completed a turn and is going straight ahead again .  
As a result of last year 's SARS outbreak , checking temperatures became an important part of medical checkups , but this extra step also put the persons responsible for checking temperatures at risk . One student , whose girlfriend is a nurse , came up with an earring thermometer that can be directly clipped to the earlobe . If the body temperature of the individual exceeds 38 oC , the heat transmitted through a conductive metal insert in the thermometer causes mercury to expand , activating a warning light .  
The owner of a Japanese-style house was fined NT $ 50,000 for " over-pruning " a tree . This fine was reportedly low , as the Department of Cultural Affairs took into consideration that the tree was only trimmed in response to neighbors ' concerns that in summer mosquitoes would thrive in its dense leaves . The law 's lowest fine was levied , with the warning that a second violation would be punished with the heaviest fine , NT $ 100,000 . However , the owner was very unimpressed .  
In its Mental Health Index Survey , completed late last year , the Mental Health Foundation discovered that approximately one half of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted that a slight increase in stress causes them to blow up . Even more shocking is the fact that 19 participants gave themselves " zero " when asked to quantify their mental health . Clear warning signals are flashing for the mental health of Taiwanese .  
The low temperatures make it tough for the workers to go on but if a typhoon should strike the high mountains , with their ubiquitous steep cliffs , the men are petrified . In 2003 Huang Chao-ying won the contracts to rebuild the Hsuehpei and Sumita shelters , located along the Shengleng trail . Work began at the end of August and in September two typhoons hit . " On hearing the news warning of the typhoon , everyone left .  
The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
The reporter learned from Guilin 's Flood and Drought Prevention Headquarter that over the past few days Guilin and its surrounding 12 counties ( autonomous counties ) saw heavy rain .  In Yongfu County , the water level was 4.45 meters above the warning line , cutting all roads linking the county town to rural townships .  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50-44 at 10,887-39 The index fell 16-52 points Tuesday , recovering from a 112 point drop that was triggered by the Federal 's warning of possible rise in interest rates in the coming months if necessary while leaving rates unchanged at present  
Early warning and alert information gathered by scientific institutions and regional civil defence organizations on disasters are a prerequisite to rapid response .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The single , modest , intention of our document was to sound a warning concerning the profound collateral effects on the entire United Nations system of the possible expansion of the number of permanent members .  
The main topics were intolerance in all its aspects , such as racism , xenophobia , anti-semitism , religious fundamentalism and aggressive nationalism ; the role of civic society ; the impact of public opinion ; the importance of early warning ; and actions at the national and international levels .  
As further stated in the Secretary-General 's report in document A / 50 / 526 , on early warning capacities of the United Nations system , the value of a timely and effective warning system to avert losses and to protect resources is essential , particularly as countries begin to incorporate disaster-reduction policies into their social and economic development plans .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
That Department has since passed through successive phases of restructuring and is now organized to follow political developments worldwide , so that it can provide early warning of impending conflicts and analyse possibilities for preventive action by the United Nations , as well as for action to help resolve existing conflicts .  
It urges Governments and major groups , as well as relevant international organizations and the scientific community , to participate actively in strengthening Earthwatch as an international partnership to ensure an adequate flow of information on the global and regional environment , to support decision-making and to give early warning on the state of the environment .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
NULLWhile there is no comprehensive international programme for the early warning of geophysical hazards , there are some internationally acknowledged technical facilities or national agencies which collect , analyse and disseminate information regarding global seismic and volcanic events .  
The experiences of both WMO and IAEA demonstrate that a sustained and broadly based effort , drawing on the distributed technical abilities of various institutions and national collaborators , is critical for the successful coordination of international warning systems .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
The departmental coordination unit to combat racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , set up within each departmental council for the prevention of delinquency under the circular issued by the Prime Minister to the prefects on 1 March 1993 , meets at least once a year to monitor problems of racism , initiate warning procedures , if necessary , collect information on local criminal policy , promote the amicable settlement of disputes and , in the light of particular local characteristics , propose measures to strengthen social cohesiveness . 
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning and preventive diplomacy , including through the activities of the High Commissioner on National Minorities , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .

The efficient work of the IDNDR national committees of France , Germany and the United Kingdom must be commended , especially in relation to the planning and organization of relevant central events of the final phase of the Decade , such as the conference on early warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters scheduled to take place at Potsdam , Germany , in 1998 ;  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
Newly emerging phenomena , such as the possibility of long-term climate change with the expectation of disastrous effects on a global scale or , better known , periodic seasonal or geographical anomalies such as the El Ni �� Southern Oscillation phenomenon , create further uncertainties and new challenges for institutionalized warning practices .  
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
The Government of Ukraine pointed out that it considered it vital to expand the efforts for preventive measures with a view to identifying and forestalling the main causes of mass exoduses and the emergence of new refugee and migrant populations , including the establishment of efficient rapid response and early _ warning mechanisms to deal with crisis situations .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;

Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
The European Parliament 's proposal that programmes that are likely to impair the physical , mental or moral development of minors should be preceded by an acoustic warning or identified by a visual symbol throughout their duration was accepted by the Council .  
Since the market and other informational failures that lay behind their taking on such excessive aggregate market exposures in East Asia were massive , the required regulatory changes would have to be far-reaching and the early warning systems elaborate .  
We also believe that countries with sophisticated and effective early warning systems have a crucial role to play in providing adequate and timely information to allow developing countries to prepare for impending disasters .  
It stated that the prevention of financial crises required enhanced early warning mechanisms , including improved and effective surveillance of national and international financial market developments .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
Later , programme targets were declared by the IDNDR Scientific and Technical Committee to encourage all countries to conduct a national hazard risk assessment ; incorporate a sustained disaster mitigation strategy into the national economic development plan ; and ensure improved access to effective early warning practices at all levels of responsibility .  
As was emphasized at the IDNDR international conference on early warning systems ( Potsdam , Germany , September 1998 ) , effective early warning is a process that must bring together scientific analysis and technical forecasting of a hazard , together with the political decision-making process and the availability of local community capabilities to heed the warning .  
As a major topical event of the IDNDR closing process and the consolidation of global views , the conference identified those accomplishments and local experiences which can best improve organizational relationships and practical effectiveness for early warning into the twenty-first century .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite-and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
When the misconduct consists of deliberate refusal to comply with an oral or written direction by the Court , not covered by rule 6.40 , and that direction is accompanied by a warning of sanctions in case of breach , the presiding judge of the Chamber of the Court dealing with the matter may order the permanent or temporary interdiction from the proceedings or , if the misconduct is of a more serious nature , impose a fine .  
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
The need for an integrated and coherent policy response to the existing and emerging environmental challenges is mirrored in UNEPs integrated organizational structure and work programme , which is based on environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning ; enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environment policy instruments ; freshwater activities ; technology transfer and industry ; and support to Africa .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
It identified five areas of concentration : ( i ) environmental information , assessment and research , including environmental emergency response capacity and strengthening of early warning and assessment functions ; ( ii ) enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; ( iii ) fresh water ; ( iv ) technology transfer and industry ; and ( v ) support to Africa ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
It is also important that in the region of north and south America a reliable information and data network be set up which would make it possible to establish a warning system to prevent illicit trafficking and to coordinate action to counter and curb such trafficking , including the tracing of networks and organized rings .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Strengthen the OAU institutional and human resources capacity in the areas of humanitarian early warning , rapid disaster response and the timely and effective coordination and interaction with member States and regional organizations in disaster situations ;  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .  
I encourage the Security Council to consider innovative mechanisms , such as establishing a subsidiary organ , an ad hoc informal working group or other informal technical arrangement to discuss prevention cases on a continuing basis , particularly with regard to periodic regional or subregional reports that I intend to submit to the Council , as well as other early warning or prevention cases brought to its attention by Members States .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;

To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Influenced by the rain water from the upper reaches area and Dongting Lake hydrographic net , since late August , the water levels at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtse River mainstream lower than Shishou rose higher than the warning water level in succession .  
The leader of the project , Dai Sirui , from Southwest Agricultural University , said the project involved the study and demonstration of key technologies of people 's working and living , ecological problems , city waste water and garbage disposal , landslide monitoring warning , pasture and husbandry sectors ' development , advantageous and unique sector 's development , and ecological and economic system reconstruction after the Three Gorges Dam conserved water .  
The director of the East China Sea Section of the State Oceanic Administration , Zhang Youfen , said red tide is a common incident in the international marine environment .  Its impacts can be confined to the smallest scope if strict monitoring , warning and precautionary measures are taken .  Any panic is unnecessary .  
Article 40 For the enterprise responsible for printing the renminbi and relevant personnel that have one of the following conditions , the People 's Bank of China will issue a warning , confiscate their profits obtained illegally , and impose on them a fine equivalent to between one and three times the value of the obtained illegal profits .  Those that do not have illicit gains will be fined between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
After studying the case , it was decided that he should be given inter-party warning as a punishment and his work position should be readjusted .  At the same time , relevant leaders in his unit were investigated and affixed the responsibility of dereliction of duty , an office-level leader who was assigned personal responsibility was instructed to write a written examination , and inter-party warning was given as punishment to a department-level cadre who is specifically responsible for the job of sorting out the housing problem .  
After reporting it to the provincial party committee and obtaining its approval , the Qinghai Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee gave Hualong County Party Committee Secretary Liu Shuheng , who bore the principal leadership responsibility , a serious warning as a measure of party discipline and removed him from the post of county party committee secretary and punished other responsible personnel involved with party disciplinary actions and administrative punishments .  
Centered on making breakthroughs in the reconnaisance and early warning problems in " striking at three things " and on " bottleneck " problems such as in guarding information in " defending against three things , " we should fully exploit the wisdom and talent of the officers and men , launch extensive mass innovation activities , combine indigenous with foreign things , continually tap the combat potential of the existing armament , and enhance the new technology content .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Third , we must make preparations ahead of time , guarding against and dispelling in a timely manner the risk of imbalances in our international balance of payments which may result from bringing in foreign capital improperly , and we should also enhance our oversight and advance warning regarding foreign capital flow , strengthening our statistical analysis of the international balance of payments .  
During the " yichi . focal lens 99 " exercise , the US troops used its most advanced simulation system and automated command system .  For instance , it used for the first time the simulated environmental technology for airforce reconnaissance and monitoring and the most advanced long-range air to surface monitoring system installed in E-8C airborne early warning aircraft to provide target data to the exercising troops , thus greatly improving the simulation effects of a computerized battlefield .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
The Cheng Kejie case has exposed the weak links in our work , yet it has also given us a profound warning concerning our work : It is necessary to severely punish corrupt elements ; yet viewing from the angle of resisting corruption and guarding against moral degeneration , it is of a greater importance to impose strict education , strict control , and strict supervision on party-member leading cadres .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
This division proceeded from the reality of its capacity for anti-air-raids with existing equipment , and comprehensively deployed all kinds of radar and optical observation instruments it had to form a well-conceived antiaircraft reconnaissance system with multiple reconnaissance networks and an " integrated multi-network early warning " system , thus enabling " all units were informed about the information obtained by any unit . "  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
Looking into the future , we can vaguely see a great blueprint of even greater grandeur : The Chinese Navy will be able to achieve a qualitative leap in its early warning , mobile , anti-submarine , air defense , electronic warfare , rapid response and other capabilities , and will be able to achieve a new improvement in its comprehensive combat capability under modern conditions .  
Showing the entire process of the operation of Air Force radar units , including rapid deployment , line erection , combat warning , rush repairs , and troop withdrawal , this war game , which was close to actual combat , served to display the high mobility of our radar units in the face of the " soft " and " hard " antipersonnel forces of the " enemy " under actual-combat conditions , as well as their capabilities to accurately and rapidly discover and handle enemy movements .  
Not too long ago , hoodwinked and instigated by Li Hongzhi 's call for " ascension to heaven to attain complete satisfaction , " five of the people bewitched by Falungong set fire to themselves at the Tiananmen Square , resulting in the tragedy of two of them dead and three injured .  That once again exposed the true nature of the evil cult .  It also served as a warning to the Falungong-bewitched .  
Xiong Mingfeng ( research fellow of Strategy department of Military Science College ) : Suppose the interception process starts with the launch of missiles by the enemy ; sensors in space first discover and report that a threatening launch has occurred , and then the national defense support satellites and space-based infrared system issue a warning of potential danger from this missile launch , and guide the radar to activate the " search grid " ; when enemy missiles are discovered , the combat control center commences rapid assessment of the interception plan .  
While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
After comprehensively completing a project aimed at integrating an " air network " information system with a " ground network " information system , which is being relentlessly pursued by the US Government , the US strategic early warning system is expected to have plugged up all its loopholes , and by that time , the United States is likely to become the most perilous source of war in its capacity as the sole space-dominating power . 
The above two different early warning systems are known as " the air-based early warning system " and " the ground-based air target surveillance and tracking system " , respectively , with the former is formed mainly by the DSP satellite system , which is capable of sounding an early warning against an incoming missile , or its future replacement - - " the air-based infrared surveillance system " , and the latter by seven key early warning systems operated by the US Air Force Space Command and the US Navy Space Command , respectively . 
However , since the DSP satellites are unable to effectively sound an early warning against an incoming tactical ballistic missile , are excessively dependent on a ground station , and are likely to sound a false alarm , and even an alarm in case of fire , the US Defense Department eventually decided in 1995 to phase out the DSP system and substitute it with an " air-based infrared early warning system " called SBIRS .  
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .  
Besides , the NWS is also assisted by a short-range early warning line called " the pine line " , which is located 49 degrees north latitude in the northernmost of the United States , running through Canada 's east coast and west coast . 
In the new century , China and Japan should , on the basis of the spirit of " taking a warning from history and looking forward to the future " and the principle determined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship , and Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , continue to hold the overall bilateral relationship from strategic and historical heights , eliminate disturbances , and overcome obstacles ; and to work hard to open up a new aspect of good neighborliness , friendship , and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan .  
We want to basically curb the trend toward worsening ecological damages and environmental pollution on land and in the rivers and the oceans .  We want to begin to improve the urban and rural environmental qualities and tentatively set up a comprehensive ecological and environmental monitoring and warning system .  We want to boost our disaster prevention and reduction capabilities and further raise the level of comprehensive resource utilization .  
1 .  To coordinate the process of joining the WTO , Taiwan should decontrol direct cross-strait trade and direct postal and telecommunications services , and , considering the Mainland 's moves to lower its trade barriers , appropriately increase and open up Mainland imports .  Meanwhile , Taiwan should also plan to set up an " early warning system governing cross-strait trade security " to take charge of affairs relevant to national security and industrial risks .  
The Military Region Air Force not only further increased the frequency of no-notice attacks , it also made them more difficult and intense .  When it selected air routes , it broke free of the previous method of using high altitudes and the same routes .  It made a point to select low altitudes , extra low altitudes , and new air routes , to minimize radar warning time as much as possible .  
Observers maintained that the white paper breaks up in a timely manner the Taiwan authorities ' " Taiwan independence " - inclined and " delaying and waiting-for-change " tactics , displays a warning to the major political figures participating in Taiwan 's general election , and points out the orientations that these political figures should follow .  
Member Wang Daming suggested that the CPPCC step up its democratic supervision and strive to curb corruptive practices .  In spite of the fact that such supervision does not carry the legal force for mandatory compliance or disciplinary restraint , it nevertheless can play a guiding , warning , suppression and publicity role .  When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .

When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .  
Regarding the defense strategy of Taiwan 's troops , Chen Shui-bian emphasized that Taiwan " still should follow the policy of ' effective deterrence , tenacious defense ' and regard the procedures for exercising control over the air and sea and for anti-landing , and the concepts of ' precise and accurate in-depth attacks , providing earlier warning , seeking advantage in information , ' and ' fighting a decisive battle outside the boundary ' as the direction of army building and preparation against war . "  
China is a peace-loving country which has mainly developed her self-defense national defense on her own .  In the meantime , China has also conducted some cooperation with the countries concerned .  Originally , China had signed with Israel an agreement on purchasing an aircraft equipped with an early warning radar on the basis of normal military trade relations between the two countries .  
It successively formulated regulations for prevention , admonition , warning , and penalties .  Various supervision measures were combined properly and implemented comprehensively .  Through more intensive ideological education , stricter internal supervision inside the leading bodies , effective organizational adjustments , and serious handling of problems and cases , the sense of self-discipline among leading cadres was raised and the effectiveness of organizational supervision was also enhanced .  
In connection with the realistic conditions of their work , a number of departments , including the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , the Central Financial Work Committee , the State Economic and Trade Commission , and the General Administration of Customs , have respectively issued special circulars in the light of concrete problems existing in their own sector , and have called for vigorous efforts to ensure a sound implementation of the warning education .  
Efforts should be taken to make the warning education a success , for it is a major content of our current efforts to strengthen the ideological and political work and it has a close inherent link with the task of thoroughgoingly conducting the " three-stresses " education .  
Recently , to allow " information to be commonly shared " and enhance our three-dimensional penetrating ability in gathering information from across the strait , the Ministry of National Defense even merged the three services ' intelligence collection systems and streamlined the information transmission methods to enliven the armed forces ' coast-based systems of early warning , wartime command , observation , communication , search for carrier terminals , and reconnaissance , thus establishing a very careful entity as well as a mobile and flexible reconnaissance and communication system .  
China has built a large number of key people 's air defense public works and basements , reinforced or renovated people 's air defense works built in the early period , built a basic network system exclusively for people 's air defense command and warning communications , developed and improved plans to prepare against air raids in urban areas , established bases for accommodating evacuated population in cities , and trained more than 300,000 ordinary citizens to become full-time professionals against air raids .  
" Related sectors " indicated that Taiwan 's current economic warning signals undoubtedly reflect fundamental problems and , even more so , elements of political unrest .  These elements have had a negative psychological impact that resulted in numerous economic measures failing to immediately achieve their expected results .  The fundamental policy of " long-term accumulation of short-term blows " caused a mutually destructive situation that was definitely not the people 's good fortune .  
It was reported that a US technical officer emphasized to an official of our National Defense Ministry who accompanied the visiting group that a higher degree of camouflage was necessary to protect long-range early warning radars against the mainland China ballistic missile threat .  In this regard we have increased the budget earmarked for camouflage works .  
Though they have expressed various views or viewed the incident from different angles , people have unanimously maintained that the incident has completely unmasked the vicious nature of " Falungong " as an evil cult and has become a negative example which may serve as a lesson or a sharp warning for " Falungong 's " followers , who should wake up by now .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
New arrangements for the warning of heavy rain , including a revised rainstorm warning system , the termination of the flood warning , and the introduction of special announcements on flooding in the northern New Territories , will be implemented for the coming rain season , the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory , Dr H K Lam , announced today ( Thursday ) .  
The Code lays down detailed requirements on how to handle obscene and indecent materials transmitted via the Internet . These include requiring members of the Association to take appropriate measures to prevent Internet users from placing or transmitting obscene material on the Internet and to block access to the problematic Web site if necessary .  Regarding indecent material suitable for adults only , the Code requires local content providers and distributors to include in the Web page concerned a warning that such material is not suitable for publication to persons under the age of 18 .  
Motorists should avoid driving in hilly areas until the rain has eased off while pedestrians should avoid walking or standing close to steep slopes or retaining walls , especially those posted with warning signs , " the Acting Head of the GEO , Mr John Massey , said .  
Motorists should avoid driving in hilly areas until the rain has eased off while pedestrians should avoid walking or standing close to a steep slope or retaining wall , especially those posted with warning signs .  
Starting from tomorrow ( April 1 ) , the day the Road Traffic ( Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles ) ( Amendment ) Regulation 2000 takes effect , all goods vehicles will be required to be fitted with an automatic device capable of giving audible and sufficient warning when they are reversing or are about to reverse .  
Although Hong Kong has not yet established a formal CERC , the normal supporting services of a CERC have , to a certain extent , been provided by the Information Technology Services Department ( ITSD ) and other industrial support organisations like the Hong Kong Productivity Council ( HKPC ) .  These include the issue of warning alert and dissemination of information on the emergence of new computer virus through the media or their web sites , and the provision of advisory services on how the virus should be properly tackled .  
As regards buildings , the Buildings Ordinance requires mandatory provision of barrier-free access and other facilities in buildings for people with disabilities , details of which are laid down in a Design Manual . Examples of the mandatory requirements include wheelchair spaces in public auditoria , toilet and water closet cubicles for the disabled , induction loop system for hearing impaired persons , tactile warning strips at both top and bottom ends of staircases for visually impaired persons , etc .  
" The reversal in the crime trend is in large a result of measure taken under the CCB 's approach which led to successful prosecutions of cases handled by the Bureau , sending a warning to those who consider engaging in the illicit trade .  " In addition to enhanced sentences for prevalent offence under the OSCO , companies with dubious or allegedly uttered accounts may be required to produce material concerning their business upon the issue of an order under section 4 of the same ordinance , " the spokesman said .  
What is more , manned emergency 24-hour telephone hotlines will be set up during amber warning rainstorm or above , together with essential standby plant and labour , so that blockages to river flow due to accumulated debris / municipal wastes can be dealt with and cleared at the earliest possible time .  
In the past few years , the Administration has introduced a number of safety measures for school buses , which included the compulsory requirement of an adult escort for all school buses carrying primary and kindergarten pupils , the installation of public address system and warning devices at doors and emergency exit doors of school buses and school light buses , and the adoption of a brighter colour scheme for new school light buses to make them more conspicuous .  
Any HA employee found to have committed such acts may be subject to disciplinary actions under HA 's prevailing human resources policy , ranging from verbal or written warning to dismissal from service .  
The special flag-raising ceremony scheduled to be held at 8 am will be cancelled owing to either thunderstorm warning , red rainstorm warning , black rainstorm warning , No . 3 typhoon signal , No . 8 typhoon signal , No . 9 typhoon signal or No . 10 typhoon signal .  
As the Hong Kong Observatory issued the very hot weather warning today ( July 6 ) , the Department of Health ( DH ) advised members of the public , particularly those engaged in outdoor activities , to take measures to prevent heat stroke in view of the prevailing hot weather .  
Its characteristic vice was also its greatest virtue : because it devoured anything it came upon , even evil spirits avoided it , and the Chinese considered it auspicious . Its fearsome features often appear on ancient bronze or ceramic dining vessels - - as a warning against overindulgence as well as a charm against evil .  
Preventive planning and control of hazardous wastes will be instituted and an environmental quality monitoring network set up in order to provide accurate warning and instant response . The Taiwan area will then live up to its reputation of being a beautiful island with blue skies and green meadows , verdant mountains and clear waters . .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
When reading Ionesco or Wu we might rejoice that it is not the human race that is endangered , or feel happy that the inhumane phenomenon of forced prison labor is confined to remote China ; we should not forget that the loss of any species to this world , or any trampling on humanity is a serious threat and warning towards anyone who enjoys their human rights and art . (  
Before the tour began , Foundation workers checked that all the bicycles ' tires were well pumped up , their brakes properly adjusted , their handlebars secure and their saddles at the right height , and they accompanied the tour in a small van carrying repair tools and two spare bikes . The children 's cycles and those of the three tour leaders were equipped with long red warning flags .  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
Many Lives , Many Masters , a book about hypnosis and past lives by an American psychiatrist , and stage performances by Western hypnotists here have stirred up a Taiwanese craze for hypnosis . They have also elicited widely divergent reactions , from the awestruck to the contemptuous , from the open-minded to the dismissive . Some have jumped at chances to be hypnotized themselves ; others have blown bugle calls of warning against what they perceive as a menace .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
In fact , with reference to existing prenatal diagnostic techniques for genetic disorders , the ROC Department of Health has issued administrative orders warning doctors that conducting fetal gender tests on pregnant women , or performing abortions based on the fetal gender , would make them guilty of malpractice under the Medical Practice Law and the Medical Treatment Law . But there are still gynecology clinics whose signboards blatantly carry such wording as " CVS testing , 100% accurate . "  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
At its most severe , cases of serious crime or crimes causing major damage or injury usually find the perpetrators given a sentence in a juvenile detention center . Other offenders might be placed in a juvenile reformatory and training school as in cases of theft or robbery . Youths charged in connection with altercations or fights might be sentenced to probation or weekend guidance . Those whose offenses are judged to be the lightest , such as runaways , truants , or those picked up wandering the streets , are usually let off with a stern warning .  
Aside from these technical preventatives , the most fundamental point is that suicide is a warning sign and can not be ignored . The wide disparities that exist between the suicide rates of different age brackets and different ethnic groups form a silent protest-a protest that must be heard as we consider the future distribution of resources in society .  
" Most people respond to a major trauma by trying to push the experience out of their conscious mind . The trauma is never spoken of and is only recognized through the symptoms the victim displays , " says Dr . Chang Ta-jen , assistant director of the Provincial Taoyuan Psychiatric Center . Chang says that as most people are unable to recognize the warning signs and symptoms , they deal with a trauma by repressing it or through displacement .  
But unlike these resilient structures , many newly-built apartment blocks came crashing down completely without warning . Many anomalies such as concertinaed individual storeys , rebars ( reinforcing bars ) pulled clean and straight out of the bases of columns , rebars snapped through like dry spaghetti , and even the joints between beams and columns filled out with cooking-oil cans , were reported to the world by the international media , to the shame of Taiwan 's construction industry .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
The innkeeper could only shake his head and watch as Wu wobbled off up the road . After a while Wu passed an official notice warning about the tiger , and realized that the innkeeper had spoken the truth . He considered turning round but then thought better of it , worried that he 'd look stupid if he went back to the inn .  
To be fair , this time around government agencies at every level were unstinting in their rescue efforts , communication and command systems worked well , and the response was swift . The problem was that the disaster covered such a vast area and came so quickly . Many mudslides and flash floods came with little or no warning , so that people could only watch helplessly as their loved ones were swallowed up or swept away , to be parted from them forever .  
Typhoon Trami , a " mini " typhoon with a radius of just 100 km , closed in on southern Taiwan on July 11 . The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by the time it passed over land that evening , but no sooner had the typhoon warning been lifted than the ensuing weather system unleashed a torrential downpour on Kaohsiung , causing the worst flooding in the city 's history .  
Just as the halls of government were reverberating with heated debate about the shortage of water , on May 8 Taiwan Power , as a result of the drought and increasing demand from the rebounding economy , began rationing power without prior warning . This decision has had an impact on more than 2,000 industrial users . Kuo Jan-tai , a civil engineering professor at National Taiwan University , points out that because the water reservoirs in Taiwan are naturally unreliable storehouses of water , dams usually generate only one-tenth of Taiwan 's electricity supply .  
It was n't until consumption reached 150% of replacement levels in May that it finally issued a completely unexpected warning . Part of the problem is that three of Taiwan Power 's liquefied natural gas storage tanks have never been put into use because of technological defects unresolved by their Japanese contractor . The power shortage has also led to widespread suspicions that Taiwan Power is technologically inept and unable to handle crises . As a result , its chairman Lin Wen-yuan tendered his resignation .  
For example , " amniotic fluid embolism " is a dangerous obstetric emergency that can occur without any prior warning or symptoms , and may cause the sudden death of a mother during or after labor . Kao Tien-fu , a director of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the ROC and convener of its medical disputes committee , has encountered two cases , and sadly was unable to save either of the women .  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
Yu used to hold down multiple jobs that kept him racing every day between the hospital , television station , radio station , and newspaper . For years he woke up brutally early to do radio and TV shows , stumbling home dead beat well after sundown . He developed a gastrointestinal problem that often left him doubled over in pain without any advance warning .  
After the SARS warning was issued , people who had been in a SARS area or who had had contact with anyone or anything having to do with SARS , were classified as " suspected " cases if they developed a fever . If they had abnormal chest radiographs ( showing whitish spots indicating the accumulation of white blood cells and body secretions ) they were classified as " probable " cases .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .  
In this increasingly competitive era , instrumental values like drive , ability to work independently , and professional knowledge are given the greatest weight by society . The media and publishing industry have been warning young people to get themselves geared up for the economic struggles ahead . But amidst all the talk of instrumental values , you have to wonder : Whatever happened to dreams , those things that make life so exciting and worthwhile ?  
As motor-scooter riders themselves , they started from their own experience of often being dazzled by the high beams of car headlights that prevent one from seeing the road ahead clearly . The team had the idea of installing a warning device to remind drivers behind to dip their lights . They combined it with a reversing alert to give a warning if the vehicle ahead backs up , and a turn signal canceling device to automatically switch off the indicator after the scooter has completed a turn and is going straight ahead again .  
As a result of last year 's SARS outbreak , checking temperatures became an important part of medical checkups , but this extra step also put the persons responsible for checking temperatures at risk . One student , whose girlfriend is a nurse , came up with an earring thermometer that can be directly clipped to the earlobe . If the body temperature of the individual exceeds 38 oC , the heat transmitted through a conductive metal insert in the thermometer causes mercury to expand , activating a warning light .  
The owner of a Japanese-style house was fined NT $ 50,000 for " over-pruning " a tree . This fine was reportedly low , as the Department of Cultural Affairs took into consideration that the tree was only trimmed in response to neighbors ' concerns that in summer mosquitoes would thrive in its dense leaves . The law 's lowest fine was levied , with the warning that a second violation would be punished with the heaviest fine , NT $ 100,000 . However , the owner was very unimpressed .  
In its Mental Health Index Survey , completed late last year , the Mental Health Foundation discovered that approximately one half of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted that a slight increase in stress causes them to blow up . Even more shocking is the fact that 19 participants gave themselves " zero " when asked to quantify their mental health . Clear warning signals are flashing for the mental health of Taiwanese .  
The low temperatures make it tough for the workers to go on but if a typhoon should strike the high mountains , with their ubiquitous steep cliffs , the men are petrified . In 2003 Huang Chao-ying won the contracts to rebuild the Hsuehpei and Sumita shelters , located along the Shengleng trail . Work began at the end of August and in September two typhoons hit . " On hearing the news warning of the typhoon , everyone left .  
The first example is the Procomp case , involving intricate and complicated capital flows . After two weeks of investigation , preliminary findings have been made public . In addition , four accountants who had contracts to audit Procomp were severely punished with a two-year suspension of business . Because the accountants were from two major domestic accounting firms , this action was a serious warning for the accounting industry and embodied the hope that the age-old abuses of purposeful undervaluation , placing too much trust in the client and not pro-actively verifying accounts could be rooted out .  
The reporter learned from Guilin 's Flood and Drought Prevention Headquarter that over the past few days Guilin and its surrounding 12 counties ( autonomous counties ) saw heavy rain .  In Yongfu County , the water level was 4.45 meters above the warning line , cutting all roads linking the county town to rural townships .  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 50-44 at 10,887-39 The index fell 16-52 points Tuesday , recovering from a 112 point drop that was triggered by the Federal 's warning of possible rise in interest rates in the coming months if necessary while leaving rates unchanged at present  
Early warning and alert information gathered by scientific institutions and regional civil defence organizations on disasters are a prerequisite to rapid response .  
Part of the mandate of ESCWA is to act as a warning system to its member States regarding the impact of global political , economic , cultural and technological changes at the national and regional levels .  
The relative effectiveness of warning and response systems is a direct consequence of the methodical scientific determination of relative risk or risks posed by specific hazards to conditions of human vulnerability .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
The single , modest , intention of our document was to sound a warning concerning the profound collateral effects on the entire United Nations system of the possible expansion of the number of permanent members .  
The main topics were intolerance in all its aspects , such as racism , xenophobia , anti-semitism , religious fundamentalism and aggressive nationalism ; the role of civic society ; the impact of public opinion ; the importance of early warning ; and actions at the national and international levels .  
As further stated in the Secretary-General 's report in document A / 50 / 526 , on early warning capacities of the United Nations system , the value of a timely and effective warning system to avert losses and to protect resources is essential , particularly as countries begin to incorporate disaster-reduction policies into their social and economic development plans .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
That Department has since passed through successive phases of restructuring and is now organized to follow political developments worldwide , so that it can provide early warning of impending conflicts and analyse possibilities for preventive action by the United Nations , as well as for action to help resolve existing conflicts .  
It urges Governments and major groups , as well as relevant international organizations and the scientific community , to participate actively in strengthening Earthwatch as an international partnership to ensure an adequate flow of information on the global and regional environment , to support decision-making and to give early warning on the state of the environment .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
While there is a need for basic operational reliability , many established and routine forms of communication can be utilized effectively for early warning if there is an official recognition of their utility and organizational planning to do so .  
NULLWhile there is no comprehensive international programme for the early warning of geophysical hazards , there are some internationally acknowledged technical facilities or national agencies which collect , analyse and disseminate information regarding global seismic and volcanic events .  
The experiences of both WMO and IAEA demonstrate that a sustained and broadly based effort , drawing on the distributed technical abilities of various institutions and national collaborators , is critical for the successful coordination of international warning systems .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
also the initiative by the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of establishing a pilot project of the Humanitarian Early Warning System , with the purpose of identifying potential crises with humanitarian implications through the analysis of its database , and welcoming further the establishment by the Department of Political Affairs , the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of interdepartmental consultations for the joint analysis of early warning of looming crises , within a broader framework for the coordination of operational planning and implementation among the three departments ,  
of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
Since the focus of attention should be on the strengthening of the Organization 's capacity for the early prevention of conflicts , rather than on measures for their subsequent settlement , his delegation believed that the functions of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations and of other divisions of the Secretariat involved in observing political developments in potential conflict areas , in early warning and in analysing the possibility of preventive action should be strengthened .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work , by promoting broader and deeper international cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities , and by revitalizing its work and that of its subcommittees .  
A sound early warning system , combining political , military , humanitarian , human rights and economic areas , would broaden the base of options and enhance the chances for success in the early detection of conflict situations .  An early international monitoring presence in itself has a major deterrent effect .  
As far as expert and technical advisory services are concerned , organizations within the United Nations system participate in the development of domestic or regional satellite communication systems for various purposes such as improving distance education , increasing public awareness in environmental protection and supplementing early warning systems for food security .  
The system complements operational early warning systems for food security in eastern and southern Africa by providing fast and efficient data distribution capacity for environmental satellite data produced by the ARTEMIS system of FAO at Rome .  
The treaty bodies , based on six human rights conventions , have not only become effective structures monitoring the compliance by States with the human rights obligations resulting from those treaties : their impact in the field of human rights goes far beyond this function and extends , inter alia , to clarification of the content of human rights ; the functioning of the human rights machinery , including early warning and preventive measures ; cooperation of Governments with the United Nations ; protection of individuals in the framework of optional communications procedures ; and human rights education .  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning , preventive diplomacy , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , and post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , such as human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that any approach to early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach ,  
54 In more than two thirds of the responding countries , law enforcement officials were always obliged , before using firearms against persons , to wait between the warning and the direct use of firearms against persons to give the offender sufficient time to observe the warning ; about a quarter reported that this principle was applied usually ; United Kingdom law enforcement officers , depending on their discretion in individual cases , had to wait between warning and the use of firearms only in exceptional cases or never . 
The departmental coordination unit to combat racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , set up within each departmental council for the prevention of delinquency under the circular issued by the Prime Minister to the prefects on 1 March 1993 , meets at least once a year to monitor problems of racism , initiate warning procedures , if necessary , collect information on local criminal policy , promote the amicable settlement of disputes and , in the light of particular local characteristics , propose measures to strengthen social cohesiveness . 
Today , the infrastructure in remote and rural areas can be significantly improved through satellite remote sensing , particularly with respect to natural disaster warning and mitigation , management of water , forest and food resources , planning and operation of transport systems and other supporting activities relating to social and economic development .  
Acknowledging the increasing contribution of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security in its region through activities in early warning and preventive diplomacy , including through the activities of the High Commissioner on National Minorities , crisis management , arms control and disarmament , post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures , and its efforts in supporting the economic dimension , as well as its crucial role in the human dimension ,  
The Workshop recommended that civil defence institutions of the region , in collaboration with outside entities , should develop mechanisms based on existing infrastructures that incorporate the use of satellite communications , remote sensing , global positioning and other space technologies for the prevention , early warning and mitigation of the effects of disasters .  
Those delegations expressed the view that the Committee should contribute to maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes by strengthening the scientific and technical content of its work and by promoting broader and deeper international and regional cooperation between all countries in outer space activities , especially in the fields of disaster warning and mitigation , and global search-and-rescue activities .

The efficient work of the IDNDR national committees of France , Germany and the United Kingdom must be commended , especially in relation to the planning and organization of relevant central events of the final phase of the Decade , such as the conference on early warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters scheduled to take place at Potsdam , Germany , in 1998 ;  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
A second pre-requisite for effective warning is both the understanding by a vulnerable population of the hazards to which it may be exposed and an appreciation of the natural forces that can destroy elements of their economic livelihood and social well-being .  
Newly emerging phenomena , such as the possibility of long-term climate change with the expectation of disastrous effects on a global scale or , better known , periodic seasonal or geographical anomalies such as the El Ni �� Southern Oscillation phenomenon , create further uncertainties and new challenges for institutionalized warning practices .  
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .  
However , unlike the international infrastructure that has been developed on the basis of distributed technical abilities and national agencies concerned with hydrometeorology , no comparable institutionalized capability exists at present to address early warning issues and related global concerns for geological hazards .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
While attention has previously largely been paid to technical applications , there is now a need to concentrate on gaining human understanding and strengthening organizational relationships essential for effective early warning .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that comprehensive approaches , particularly early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Ever since my President , Mr . Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , apprised this Assembly in 1987 of the impending environmental disaster that rising sea levels posed to our country , the Maldives has been warning vigorously , at national , regional and international levels , of this problem .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
The Government of Ukraine pointed out that it considered it vital to expand the efforts for preventive measures with a view to identifying and forestalling the main causes of mass exoduses and the emergence of new refugee and migrant populations , including the establishment of efficient rapid response and early _ warning mechanisms to deal with crisis situations .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Conscious of the fact that mass exoduses of populations are caused by multiple and complex factors , which may include human rights violations , political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation , which indicate that early warning requires an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent system _ wide response , particularly at the international and regional levels ,  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;

Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights ordered or sanctioned by a Government to be international crimes could to some extent help to prevent gross and massive violations of human rights by acting as a warning to Governments and public officials .  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
The European Parliament 's proposal that programmes that are likely to impair the physical , mental or moral development of minors should be preceded by an acoustic warning or identified by a visual symbol throughout their duration was accepted by the Council .  
Since the market and other informational failures that lay behind their taking on such excessive aggregate market exposures in East Asia were massive , the required regulatory changes would have to be far-reaching and the early warning systems elaborate .  
We also believe that countries with sophisticated and effective early warning systems have a crucial role to play in providing adequate and timely information to allow developing countries to prepare for impending disasters .  
It stated that the prevention of financial crises required enhanced early warning mechanisms , including improved and effective surveillance of national and international financial market developments .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
Later , programme targets were declared by the IDNDR Scientific and Technical Committee to encourage all countries to conduct a national hazard risk assessment ; incorporate a sustained disaster mitigation strategy into the national economic development plan ; and ensure improved access to effective early warning practices at all levels of responsibility .  
As was emphasized at the IDNDR international conference on early warning systems ( Potsdam , Germany , September 1998 ) , effective early warning is a process that must bring together scientific analysis and technical forecasting of a hazard , together with the political decision-making process and the availability of local community capabilities to heed the warning .  
As a major topical event of the IDNDR closing process and the consolidation of global views , the conference identified those accomplishments and local experiences which can best improve organizational relationships and practical effectiveness for early warning into the twenty-first century .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite-and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
When the misconduct consists of deliberate refusal to comply with an oral or written direction by the Court , not covered by rule 6.40 , and that direction is accompanied by a warning of sanctions in case of breach , the presiding judge of the Chamber of the Court dealing with the matter may order the permanent or temporary interdiction from the proceedings or , if the misconduct is of a more serious nature , impose a fine .  
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
The need for an integrated and coherent policy response to the existing and emerging environmental challenges is mirrored in UNEPs integrated organizational structure and work programme , which is based on environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning ; enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environment policy instruments ; freshwater activities ; technology transfer and industry ; and support to Africa .  
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
It identified five areas of concentration : ( i ) environmental information , assessment and research , including environmental emergency response capacity and strengthening of early warning and assessment functions ; ( ii ) enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; ( iii ) fresh water ; ( iv ) technology transfer and industry ; and ( v ) support to Africa ;  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Providing relevant and up-to-date information and early warning on regional and global emerging issues and potential environmental threats as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
We will strengthen the dialogue with the OAU and subregional organizations on concrete possibilities for backing their efforts , inter alia in the fields of early warning , preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping and of awareness of the importance of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law , the rule of law , a pluralist society , democratic institutions and practices , and a culture of tolerance .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
It is also important that in the region of north and south America a reliable information and data network be set up which would make it possible to establish a warning system to prevent illicit trafficking and to coordinate action to counter and curb such trafficking , including the tracing of networks and organized rings .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
In addition , UNDP has fielded a mission to assess the feasibility of , and host government interest in , the creation of an early warning mechanism that would monitor , at the subregional level , key economic , social , political , ethnic and religious variables , carry out systematic trend analysis to track changes and potential tensions and provide , in a timely fashion , much-needed signals of forthcoming crises or emergencies .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Strengthen the OAU institutional and human resources capacity in the areas of humanitarian early warning , rapid disaster response and the timely and effective coordination and interaction with member States and regional organizations in disaster situations ;  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .  
I encourage the Security Council to consider innovative mechanisms , such as establishing a subsidiary organ , an ad hoc informal working group or other informal technical arrangement to discuss prevention cases on a continuing basis , particularly with regard to periodic regional or subregional reports that I intend to submit to the Council , as well as other early warning or prevention cases brought to its attention by Members States .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
Calls upon Governments to continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts in the field of natural disasters within the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , based upon an effective division of labour , from prevention to early warning , response , mitigation , rehabilitation and reconstruction , including through capacity-building at all levels , and the development and strengthening of global and regional approaches that take into account regional , subregional , national and local circumstances and needs , as well as the need to strengthen coordination of national emergency response agencies in natural disasters ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening the international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction ;

To reduce the level of vulnerability to natural disasters based on planning instruments such as ecological and economic land management ; and to promote a culture of risk awareness to further their prevention and mitigation through educational processes and improved information and early warning systems while encouraging participation on the part of civil society .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Strengthening existing and , where needed , establishing early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;
