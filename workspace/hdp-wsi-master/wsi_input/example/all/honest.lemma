The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .  We have introduced a series of laws and regulations on honest government , and we have to different degrees solved some of the more serious problems the masses are most concerned about .  The struggle to treat the symptoms and the causes of corruption is developing in depth and is gaining breadth .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .

We should help them clarify their thinking and distinguish between right and wrong and constantly strengthen their ability to repel corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .  
at the same time , an individual 's responsibilities and duties for the collective and the state are stressed ; all people are encouraged to care about the overall interests of the nation , be honest and keep their promises , be united and help each other , be enthusiastic for public benefits , and do more good things for the people and for society .  
Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .

The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .

The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .  We have introduced a series of laws and regulations on honest government , and we have to different degrees solved some of the more serious problems the masses are most concerned about .  The struggle to treat the symptoms and the causes of corruption is developing in depth and is gaining breadth .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
It is necessary to safeguard the unity of leading groups to enhance the cohesion force of party committees , uphold collective leadership to strengthen the fighting force of party committees , stay honest , upright , and free from corruption to enhance the appealing force of party committees , and realistically build party committees at all levels into strong leading collectives which can consciously uphold and comprehensively practice the " three represents " .

At present and in a future period , we must continue to have leading cadres set self-discipline and be clean and honest , investigate cases of violating discipline and law , penetratingly correct unhealthy practice and make special efforts to handle corrupt cases .  In the mean time , we should prevent and stop corruption from the sources .

Meanwhile , we should remain honest and clean in performing official duties , do a good job in the building of a sound party style , reinforce supervision by party organizations , strictly enforce discipline constraint , advocate a strict self-control , strictly demand leaders to assume responsibility for their work , and uphold the practice that every level is responsible for the work of its immediate subordinate level and that checks on implementation are made at all levels .

The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .

However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
States , as the principal actors in the realization of the right to development , should guarantee the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms , strengthen democracy and ensure an honest and transparent public administration and an efficient and impartial administration of justice .  
The attainment of that objective required good governance , which could be defined as government that was honest , open and equitable , that provided public institutions which were stable , responsive and reliable and that was transparent , representative , accountable and restrained .  
I would be less than honest if I did not admit that at times , I thought the game was not worth a candle , and yet we went on because we perceived among the partners in negotiation an accommodating approach to finding a common understanding on some of the most intractable problems and complex issues that were the substance of the negotiations .  
Concerned by the climate in which the electoral process has taken place , the European Union expresses its firm hope that the Haitian people will be able as soon as possible to express its will in free , honest and transparent elections , held in accordance with rules and procedures accepted by all , in which citizens have the widest possible range of options and choices .
