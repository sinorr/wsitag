The benefits of the descendent residents of Portugal in Macao are protected according to the law .  Their customs , culture and tradition are respected .  
Wherever blockades are organized and superior goods from outside are unable to enter , the consumers there can only buy inferior local products , and so their interests are damaged , while the protected inferior enterprises have no intention of improving themselves , and are ultimately bound to be mercilessly knocked out in market competition ;  
The joint action to crack down on fake products has effectively protected consumers ' interest and maintained market economic order , hence , it was welcome by the broad masses and the enterprises at home and abroad .

Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
It is gratifying that , in the western region now , the masses ' enthusiasm for opening up cultivated land on slopes and returning land unfit for grain production to forestry and animal husbandry is running high .  This valuable enthusiasm of the peasants must be seriously protected through such measures as reducing peasants ' burdens , and others .

If we come across similar incidents in future , we should resolutely expose them , acting according to international law .  That is , despite accidental hitting or mistaken judgment , the international court should rule in light of results irrespective of original intentions or desire .  No matter how good your intentions are , you must compensate and be legally held responsible even you hit or injure , by accident , the target protected by international law .

In pushing forward the " five breakthroughs and one strengthening " in trade union work , we must not feel content simply because such work is under way in accordance with the procedure .  What is crucial is to see if such work has produced tangible results , i.e . , if the legitimate rights and interests of the employees have been successfully protected , whether or not the employees approve of it , and whether or not it is beneficial to the reform , development , and stability of enterprises .

"  
Speaking on how the people 's courts mediated in civil , commercial , and administrative relations , resolved social contradictions , and promoted national economic and social development , Xiao Yang said : Last year , people 's courts at all levels stepped up their efforts in protecting intellectual property rights , punished illegal infringement upon intellectual property rights , curbed improper competition , and protected legitimate rights and interests of property rights owners .  
On cases that closely related to the people 's production and life , which could easily lead to intensified contradictions , such as those involved forestry land , natural resources , peasants ' burdens , and removal and resettlement of residents , the courts identified responsibilities , properly resolved the disputes , and protected the legitimate rights and interests of related parties , thereby promoting administrative relations in accordance with the law . 
According to report by reporter Zhang Jingyong from the meeting of the education group , in their discussions , the committee members held that last year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate strictly performed their judicial and prosecuting functions , severely punished various types of criminal offenders on the basis of laws , protected the legitimate interests of the masses , and played an important role in maintaining social stability .

With the high degree of autonomy given to Hong Kong under the Basic Law , the international community could be assured that their investments , their business dealings , their commercial contracts and their human rights and freedoms would continue to be protected by a legal system and an independent judiciary based on the common law .  
The corner stones of Hong Kong 's success - the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field for business , a low and stable tax regime , a freely convertible currency , the free and unfettered flow of information , press and other freedoms - had been preserved and protected since reunification .  
It sends an important message to the international community that their investments , their business dealings , their commercial contracts and their human rights and freedoms are protected by a trusted legal system and an independent judiciary based on English common law , " she noted .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
On the supervision of funds-in-transit , Ms Yu stressed that approved MPF trustees were each required to put in place a stringent internal control mechanism regarding the handling of MPF contributions .

Under our proposals , which are based on the existing law , ' protected information ' only includes five tightly defined categories of information relating to : ( i ) security and intelligence ; ( ii ) defence ; ( iii ) international relations ; ( iv ) relations between the Central Authorities of the PRC and Hong Kong ; and ( v ) the commission of offences and criminal investigations .  
We have therefore decided to define the relevant activities more precisely to mean " illegal access " of protected information , which would only mean specified criminal acts , that is unauthorized access to computer by telecommunication , access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent , theft , robbery , burglary or bribery .  
* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years

These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
He told the Executive Yuan that large-scale investment and planning should be effected to make the region a protected area . In 1981 , the Home Administration invited experts in park and environmental planning to assist in organization of the national park scheme . The team spent one year investigating the plant and animal life in the area , as well as the geology , climate and natural ecology of the entire peninsula .  
Sunbathers and swimmers flock to the protected waters of the bay all year round , drawn by the balmy weather and clear waters . K'enting Gardens lie nestled in the hills above the Nanwan . They were established during the days of the Japanese occupation .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Originally , outside of the dikes there were 17 acres of protected aboriginal land . In 1976 this had been eradicated by flowing soil and rocks carried from upstream . Although the county government agreed to compensate the residents NT $ 143,800 per acre , the aborigines no longer had enough to invest in recovering the land , since " after another year it would just be washed out again ! " says Chuoshui Rural Township elected official Chang Yi-hsiung unhappily .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
Before planting 20 million trees : Countries which attach importance to planning prefer to coordinate according to available land resources . For example , when a new residential area was being developed in the Roehampton district of London , it went through detailed planning with the original trees all being kept and protected just as though it were a park . Places such as the special tree-shaded walkway in Berlin , and innumerable other examples , could also be cited .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
For instance , one stretch of road runs along the narrow point of a precipice . Although the outer ledge is protected by railing , one feels a sense of complete exhilaration . This is also the location along the trail with the finest vantage point . One can view from after the river bluffs of Lushui and look straight down upon the torrential Liwu River dropping down , the Central Cross Island Highway at its foot .  
Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
In the neighborhood of Wu Tzu-tien ( a tree named for the only female emperor in Chinese history ) , there is a small stretch of Taiwan sassafras growing . The supple leaves of this plant are a favorite food for Papilio xuthus butterflies , and if your luck is running good you 'll be able to see these two protected species , one plant , one animal , side-by-side .  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Vargas says that damage to the environment has awakened the consciousness of Costa Ricans , and there is a consensus to protect nature . In 1990 , after the government established a ministry for natural resources and the environment ( whose Spanish acronym is MINAE ) , 50,000 square kilometers of land-a full quarter of all remaining forest-was made into ten protected areas , and 24 national parks . More than 700 conservation officers do wildlife surveys and park protection on a full-time basis ( please see the accompanying article ) .

Well trained , possessed of strong bodies and agile minds , these men were ready for anything . But the aging body of the man they protected was weakening by the day . Finally , this candle flickering in the wind was extinguished .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
A further key element of the counter-pornography policy is the TV classification system introduced in January this year , similar to movie classifications , in which programs are graded and color-coded according to content : red for " restricted , " yellow for " parental guidance , " blue for " protected " and green for " general audience . "  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
In February of last year , the female snake 's belly gradually began to swell , and an ultrasound examination confirmed she was pregnant . In the two weeks after she laid her eggs , the female hundred-pacer protected them vigorously . Not daring to anger her , the zoo staff waited for her maternal instincts to subside somewhat before removing the eggs .  
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
As visitors , ensconced in a fog of incense smoke , worshipped this seated , silver-faced female deity who protected the people when they first came here to build the town , they were also able to have a detailed look at the main hall , exquisitely sculpted by the early Republican masters Li Huan-mei , Chiang Hsin , and Kuo Hsin-lin , and imagine the exciting scenes of yesteryear when boats filled the harbor and their sails filled the sky .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
After Kuan had completed a substantial number of egg carvings , their durability began to be a concern among those who had collected them . But Kuan is not worried that his art is invariably transitory . He gives the example of the 100-year-old Russian " Faberge egg " that the Tsar gave as a present to the King of England and which still remains very much intact in Buckingham Palace . " The crucial point in storing egg carvings is simply whether or not they are well protected , " he said .

Ensure that the rights of national minorities are protected , and that such groups are able to pursue economic and social development and live in circumstances of full respect for their identity , traditions , forms of social organization and cultural and religious values .  17 .  The Charter of the United Nations has provided a durable framework for the promotion and development of international law .  
Paragraph 40 ( c ) of chapter II , section D , on enhanced social protection , points to the potential resourcefulness of older persons , suggesting that particular efforts should be made towards " ensuring that older persons are able to meet their basic human needs through access to social services and social security , that those in need are assisted , that older persons are protected from abuse and violence and are treated as a resource and not a burden " .  
It urges genuine cooperation among all States in the framework of international legitimacy so that the necessary measures may be taken to prevent and combat terrorism and eliminate its causes , and it calls for the formulation of internationally acceptable criteria to differentiate clearly between terrorism , which must be condemned and opposed , and national struggle against foreign occupation , which must be protected and supported .

It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
After the Criminal Procedural Law was amended in 1996 , administrative detention was rescinded .  As this prevents prolonged detention in some cases , the improper adoption of coercive measures has been reduced , and people 's civil rights have been better protected .  At the same time , this does not produce any negative impact on the effectiveness of cracking down on crimes . "  
First of all , the special administrative region seriously exercises the right of administrative management , legislation , and power of final adjudication and right of independent justice that the basic law gives , so the residents of Macao fully enjoy all the freedom and rights of speech , journalism , religion , and forming groups that the basic law rules .  The benefits of the descendent residents of Portugal in Macao are protected according to the law .  Their customs , culture and tradition are respected .  
Wherever blockades are organized and superior goods from outside are unable to enter , the consumers there can only buy inferior local products , and so their interests are damaged , while the protected inferior enterprises have no intention of improving themselves , and are ultimately bound to be mercilessly knocked out in market competition ;  
The joint action to crack down on fake products has effectively protected consumers ' interest and maintained market economic order , hence , it was welcome by the broad masses and the enterprises at home and abroad .

Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
It is gratifying that , in the western region now , the masses ' enthusiasm for opening up cultivated land on slopes and returning land unfit for grain production to forestry and animal husbandry is running high .  This valuable enthusiasm of the peasants must be seriously protected through such measures as reducing peasants ' burdens , and others .  
The implementation of the proactive fiscal policy has protected social stability , maintained the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy , and improved the people 's living standards although it has also increased deficits and debts .

While inspecting the contingent 's vehicles and other equipment , Luo Gan said : In cracking criminal cases , the public security people 's police usually faces extremely cruel criminals ; therefore , our criminal and special police forces should be very competent and skillful and well equipped in order to ensure that the enemy is most forcefully dealt with and they themselves are most effectively protected .  
On the other hand , China 's trade-related laws and regulations should be improved through fully applying the WTO rules and regulations and taking the existing rules and regulations in countries with developed market economies so that the major state economic interests can be better protected and the principles of mutual benefit , non-discrimination , and fairness will be realized .  
Deputy Zhang Xinan said currently , it is imperative to enact a law on protecting peasants ' rights and interests and laws and regulations governing the responsibility and obligations to be born by peasants , so that peasants ' legitimate rights and interests and personal and property safety are protected by the law while they are required by the law to bear due responsibility and obligations .  
In this year 's report , " arable land should be effectively protected " is the second sentence at the beginning of a related paragraph .  It has become the prerequisite of " structural adjustment .

"  
Speaking on how the people 's courts mediated in civil , commercial , and administrative relations , resolved social contradictions , and promoted national economic and social development , Xiao Yang said : Last year , people 's courts at all levels stepped up their efforts in protecting intellectual property rights , punished illegal infringement upon intellectual property rights , curbed improper competition , and protected legitimate rights and interests of property rights owners .  
On cases that closely related to the people 's production and life , which could easily lead to intensified contradictions , such as those involved forestry land , natural resources , peasants ' burdens , and removal and resettlement of residents , the courts identified responsibilities , properly resolved the disputes , and protected the legitimate rights and interests of related parties , thereby promoting administrative relations in accordance with the law . 
According to report by reporter Zhang Jingyong from the meeting of the education group , in their discussions , the committee members held that last year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate strictly performed their judicial and prosecuting functions , severely punished various types of criminal offenders on the basis of laws , protected the legitimate interests of the masses , and played an important role in maintaining social stability .

Mr Cheung said that most of the works protected by copyright are informational .  Examples are literary , musical , dramatic , artistic works , sound recordings , films , wireless radio and television broadcast , cable radio and television diffusion .  
With the high degree of autonomy given to Hong Kong under the Basic Law , the international community could be assured that their investments , their business dealings , their commercial contracts and their human rights and freedoms would continue to be protected by a legal system and an independent judiciary based on the common law .  
The corner stones of Hong Kong 's success - the rule of law , an independent judiciary , a level playing field for business , a low and stable tax regime , a freely convertible currency , the free and unfettered flow of information , press and other freedoms - had been preserved and protected since reunification .  
It sends an important message to the international community that their investments , their business dealings , their commercial contracts and their human rights and freedoms are protected by a trusted legal system and an independent judiciary based on English common law , " she noted .  
These include the rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary ; open and accountable government ; a clean civil service ; a level playing field for business ; a duty-free port ; low taxes ; free movement of goods , capital and people ; the free and unfettered flow of news information and ideas ; and a whole range of freedoms guaranteed and protected by our constitution , the Basic Law - for example , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , of expression , freedom to travel .  
On the supervision of funds-in-transit , Ms Yu stressed that approved MPF trustees were each required to put in place a stringent internal control mechanism regarding the handling of MPF contributions .

"  
On the basis that women 's rights are human rights , a strategic approach for advancement of women must bear in mind the enjoyment of all fundamental rights and freedoms including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the right to development protected by the various instruments binding on the parties to the Beijing Declaration . 
Under our proposals , which are based on the existing law , ' protected information ' only includes five tightly defined categories of information relating to : ( i ) security and intelligence ; ( ii ) defence ; ( iii ) international relations ; ( iv ) relations between the Central Authorities of the PRC and Hong Kong ; and ( v ) the commission of offences and criminal investigations .  
We have therefore decided to define the relevant activities more precisely to mean " illegal access " of protected information , which would only mean specified criminal acts , that is unauthorized access to computer by telecommunication , access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent , theft , robbery , burglary or bribery .  
* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years

These will be surrounded by an agricultural zone which in turn is surrounded by a protected area where development is prohibited . Upon completion it is projected that the new city will have a population of 450,000 . It will be a total living environment where people can work , live and relax .  
Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
He told the Executive Yuan that large-scale investment and planning should be effected to make the region a protected area . In 1981 , the Home Administration invited experts in park and environmental planning to assist in organization of the national park scheme . The team spent one year investigating the plant and animal life in the area , as well as the geology , climate and natural ecology of the entire peninsula .  
Sunbathers and swimmers flock to the protected waters of the bay all year round , drawn by the balmy weather and clear waters . K'enting Gardens lie nestled in the hills above the Nanwan . They were established during the days of the Japanese occupation .  
As agriculture becomes more industrialized and technology-led , more and more pesticides , fertilizers and farming equipment that are decisive for agricultural production are being developed . Like any other products , these technologies are also protected by national patent laws .  
Originally , outside of the dikes there were 17 acres of protected aboriginal land . In 1976 this had been eradicated by flowing soil and rocks carried from upstream . Although the county government agreed to compensate the residents NT $ 143,800 per acre , the aborigines no longer had enough to invest in recovering the land , since " after another year it would just be washed out again ! " says Chuoshui Rural Township elected official Chang Yi-hsiung unhappily .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
Before planting 20 million trees : Countries which attach importance to planning prefer to coordinate according to available land resources . For example , when a new residential area was being developed in the Roehampton district of London , it went through detailed planning with the original trees all being kept and protected just as though it were a park . Places such as the special tree-shaded walkway in Berlin , and innumerable other examples , could also be cited .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
This is why many people take the view that just at the basic spirit behind the children 's welfare law is that children have self-esteem and need to be respected by adults , wild animals involved in the workings of human society also need people to fight for their most basic right " not to be subjected to mental terror or physical abuse , " in the same way that disadvantaged groups in society are protected .  
For instance , one stretch of road runs along the narrow point of a precipice . Although the outer ledge is protected by railing , one feels a sense of complete exhilaration . This is also the location along the trail with the finest vantage point . One can view from after the river bluffs of Lushui and look straight down upon the torrential Liwu River dropping down , the Central Cross Island Highway at its foot .  
Lu Kuang-yang says that although musk deer , certain tortoises and horned toads are protected animals , if there is clear documentation about the sources of domestically sold medicinal ingredients and a ban on the use of threatened species , then associations of doctors and pharmacists can control themselves . With the Board of Foreign Trade handling all imports , medicinal ingredients can be stamped to show that they are legal and thus prevent smuggling . With " complete rules of the game , " he would then not object to unthreatened animals being used in limited quantities .  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
In the neighborhood of Wu Tzu-tien ( a tree named for the only female emperor in Chinese history ) , there is a small stretch of Taiwan sassafras growing . The supple leaves of this plant are a favorite food for Papilio xuthus butterflies , and if your luck is running good you 'll be able to see these two protected species , one plant , one animal , side-by-side .  
Liu Kuang-ming says that although the problem is complex , it is not inevitable that the day will come when fishermen are banned from having even a single shark in their nets . Instead , it would be better if , after surveys , endangered sharks ' breeding grounds can be protected , the amount of shark to be caught each year can be limited , or a set of practical measures can be devised as early as possible for the use of sharks .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Vargas says that damage to the environment has awakened the consciousness of Costa Ricans , and there is a consensus to protect nature . In 1990 , after the government established a ministry for natural resources and the environment ( whose Spanish acronym is MINAE ) , 50,000 square kilometers of land-a full quarter of all remaining forest-was made into ten protected areas , and 24 national parks . More than 700 conservation officers do wildlife surveys and park protection on a full-time basis ( please see the accompanying article ) .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
From their early twenties into their thirties and forties , these bodyguards weathered innumerable storms with CCK . Well trained , possessed of strong bodies and agile minds , these men were ready for anything . But the aging body of the man they protected was weakening by the day . Finally , this candle flickering in the wind was extinguished .  
Apart from affirming the principle of sexual equality , this ruling also stressed that the constitution protects the freedom to choose one 's own residence . " Family relationships , freedom to choose one 's residence , and equality of the sexes , all of which are protected by the constitution , are interrelated , and among the inalienable rights of an individual , " wrote the China Times in an editorial . " It is essential that both husband and wife respect each other 's dignity . "  
A further key element of the counter-pornography policy is the TV classification system introduced in January this year , similar to movie classifications , in which programs are graded and color-coded according to content : red for " restricted , " yellow for " parental guidance , " blue for " protected " and green for " general audience . "  
Except for a small number of sea creatures which are attracting international attention because their numbers are dropping sharply-such as the shark , whale , and sea turtle-few marine animals are protected by law , and it is not difficult for aquariums to collect specimens . Since these then become the main selling points to attract visitors , particular attention is therefore devoted to how these precious creatures respond to their new environment .  
Yeh Wen-chi emphasizes that the natural history of each dragonfly species is unique , and it is hard to generalize . For instance , the protected giant spiketail only breeds once in three years . It does not fit the general pattern of insects which live fleeting lives and may produce several generations a year .  
In February of last year , the female snake 's belly gradually began to swell , and an ultrasound examination confirmed she was pregnant . In the two weeks after she laid her eggs , the female hundred-pacer protected them vigorously . Not daring to anger her , the zoo staff waited for her maternal instincts to subside somewhat before removing the eggs .  
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places . Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants . There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species . At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
As visitors , ensconced in a fog of incense smoke , worshipped this seated , silver-faced female deity who protected the people when they first came here to build the town , they were also able to have a detailed look at the main hall , exquisitely sculpted by the early Republican masters Li Huan-mei , Chiang Hsin , and Kuo Hsin-lin , and imagine the exciting scenes of yesteryear when boats filled the harbor and their sails filled the sky .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
After Kuan had completed a substantial number of egg carvings , their durability began to be a concern among those who had collected them . But Kuan is not worried that his art is invariably transitory . He gives the example of the 100-year-old Russian " Faberge egg " that the Tsar gave as a present to the King of England and which still remains very much intact in Buckingham Palace . " The crucial point in storing egg carvings is simply whether or not they are well protected , " he said .  
They should be addressed in a balanced and integrated manner and protected and promoted with due regard for specific cultural , social , economic and political circumstances .  
Many formal sector firms , private and public , have grown accustomed to protected markets , discriminatory administrative procedures and controlled banking practices , and have problems adjusting to free markets .
