The " opinions " are based on profound research and scientific proof and on repeated discussions and revisions at the all-military conference on ideological and political work that was held not long ago at colleges and universities .  
The method of citing examples as a proof and the functional method are both scientific methods for studying a problem .  If we can comprehensively use various advanced methods for the studies of social sciences and natural sciences , then we certainly will have more innovative and advanced elements in our research .  We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
Then we should build corresponding mathematical models and set up information-linkage relations among them .  In this way , it will be easy for us to carry out a systematic analysis on as well as a demonstration and proof of complicated commanding problems .  It is also helpful to form connecting ties between various links so as to meet the requirement of stability in command and control .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .

10 .  The way the Ordinance is written has put the main burden of proof on the attending medical practitioner because he has received professional training and would be the most suitable person to give justifications for the application .  Nevertheless , since the medial practitioner is neither the donor nor the recipient , it is difficult for him to represent both parties to submit the proof to the Board and certify that there is no commercial dealing .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
Between the ages of seven and 14 , there is a legal presumption that a child is incapable of committing a crime , but this can be rebutted by the prosecution on proof beyond reasonable doubt that , at the time of the offence , the child was well aware that his or her act was seriously wrong , and not merely naughty or mischievous . 
As a high standard of proof is required for " criminal offences " , it is often more difficult to convict complicated commercial crimes and takes a great deal of resources and time to establish a case .  As such , the criminal approach to deal with market misconduct may not necessarily have a stronger deferent effect on committed offenders .  
There is yet no scientific proof that genetically modified food ( GMF ) is unsafe for human consumption and as such , the public need not be alarmed over the reported presence of GMF in the local market .

As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .

In recent excavations of ancient tombs from the Spring and Autumn period , in the tomb of Lady Gouyu , younger sister of Lord Jing ( ruled 516-476 BC ) of the state of Song , a bronze basin was discovered which contained nothing but a large quantity of Sichuan peppercorns .

" Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools .

Batu that Turkey does not harbour any designs or territorial ambitions against Greece or any of its neighbours and without going into any historic retrospection that would give ample and eloquent proof of Turkey 's traditional performance in the broader area of the Balkans and the Middle East , suffice it to recall the notorious contemporary case of the military invasion and ongoing occupation of Cyprus .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
Yugoslavia 's continued and concrete contribution to the process of negotiation is considered by a large part of the international community as proof of its sincere and lasting orientation towards peace and a comprehensive political solution of the Yugoslav crisis .

The acts of provocation and aggression reported above constitute a grave violation of the cease-fire agreement in force between the two countries as well as a blatant attack on Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and flout the principles which govern friendly and good-neighbourly relations between States ; above all , they offer clear proof that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is persisting in its determination to pursue a policy that runs counter to the aforementioned principles and does not seek to ensure stability and security in the region .  
Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .

Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
Regarding paragraphs 16 _ 21 , concerning what he calls guilt by association , the Government of Iraq wishes to emphasize that the allegations contained in these paragraphs are totally unfounded ; they are pure fabrications and biased accusations that are baseless , devoid of any material proof and intended to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national regime . 
Successful efforts at the regional level demonstrate the feasibility of this undertaking and constitute proof of the ability of the international community to arrive at common concepts and to devise generally acceptable methods and strategies that would form the basis of improved and effective international cooperation .

Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
As a result of his research , the Special Rapporteur has ample proof that indigenous peoples / nations who have entertained treaty relationships with non-indigenous settlers and their continuators strongly argue that those instruments not only continue to be valid and applicable to their situation today but are a key element for their survival as distinct peoples .  
We believe that the renewed military escalation that began at the end of last month , as is the case every summer , is sufficient proof of the repetitive pattern of chronic fighting that is prolonging the political uncertainty and deepening the misery of the Afghan people by causing many casualties among the innocent population .  
Other areas of concern to developing countries relate to the proof of sound scientific evidence of their own sanitary and phytosanitary measures , market access restrictions resulting from pests and diseases existing elsewhere in the country concerned ( but not in the region of the exporter ) or , more generally , the potential trade and / or economic impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers applied against their exports .  
The construction is telling proof that the United States Government cares little about the political solution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija , and that its main concern is to occupy part of the sovereign territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and establish a long-term presence in the autonomous province of its constituent Republic of Serbia under the guise of participating in the United Nations security presence .  
Not at issue before the superior appellate court was 1 ) the holding by the lower court that a notice of lack of conformity made within 7 to 17 days was in time , given that the goods in question concerned meat that was frozen , not fresh ( article 39 CISG ) ; and 2 ) the ruling that , as the CISG does not expressly deal with the burden of proof , such lacuna must be filled by interpretation of the Convention .

Our presence here is proof of the fact that , astonishing though it may seem , the newly developed media and means of communication can not satisfy the need human beings feel for personal and direct contact in order to establish a dialogue conducive to peace this fact was certainly not lost on the founding fathers of the United Nations system .  
Some are prohibited ( for exports and for domestic , rather than imported , inputs ) ; others are actionable ( they can be punished subject to proof of injury ) ; and three are permissible ( all heavily utilized in the North Atlantic ) .

The long series of armed conflicts in Africa inevitably involving mercenaries organized in various ways offers harsh and brutal proof of the fact that the real and effective exercise of the right of many African peoples to self-determination has not been realized .  
It was amply clear from the testimony he had gathered , from his visit to the premises damaged by the explosions , from his interviews with the victims and with the accused , and from the documentary proof submitted to him that those actions , premeditated , financed and directed from abroad , had undermined the self-determination of a Member State and had struck a blow at the lives and physical integrity of its citizens , as well as causing serious economic harm .

We can avoid the tendency of " paying more attention to the studies of military arts than to the scientific and technology foundation " .  
Then we should build corresponding mathematical models and set up information-linkage relations among them .  In this way , it will be easy for us to carry out a systematic analysis on as well as a demonstration and proof of complicated commanding problems .

As a high standard of proof is required for " criminal offences " , it is often more difficult to convict complicated commercial crimes and takes a great deal of resources and time to establish a case .

As for the current fashion for biographies of contemporary political figures , historians view this as " front line " work in the writing of history , by which the opinions of contemporary persons are first recorded ; but defining each person 's place in the rolling tide of history is something that must wait many decades or even centuries , until historians can make judgements on the basis of more comprehensive investigation and more stringent proof .

Once an organization had been shown to engage in terrorist activity in one country and there was cogent evidence of such involvement , its designation as a terrorist organization in the country where acts were committed should be prima facie evidence , if not conclusive proof , anywhere in the world , of the nature of its activities and sufficient to include , for purposes of liability , front organizations and other devices set up to conceal its true identity .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .
