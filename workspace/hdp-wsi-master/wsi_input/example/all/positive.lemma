Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
The introduction of these policies and measures is conducive to increasing fund input for the western development , improving the environment for investment in the western region , opening the western region still wider to both foreign and domestic investors , and giving greater support to the development of science , technology , education , and the training of talented personnel in the western region .  It will certainly produce an important effect in pushing forward the implementation of the large-scale western development strategy in a positive and orderly way .

In 1986 , our ministry announced management measures , and in 1993 our ministry in conjunction with the General Customs Administration promulgated the " Management Measures for Small-Volume Trade with the Taiwan Region . " Small-volume trade is conducted by approved small-volume trade companies under the supervision of Customs and is supplementary to the regular trade across the strait .  Its existence and development has advanced the understanding of the people on both sides of the strait and has played a positive role in encouraging direct trade across the strait .  
Since 2000 , all regions and departments in the country , acting in accordance with the plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the requirements they set for agriculture and rural economic development in the new stage , have earnestly carried out the party 's rural policies .  They have strengthened the role of agriculture being the foundation of the national economy , and they exerted great efforts in promoting the restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy .  Agriculture and the rural economy are now developing steadily and have had many positive changes .  
An Min , assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation , said here on 6 January that the mainland will continue to encourage Taiwan businessmen to develop trade , make investments , and run businesses in the mainland , and protect all legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen in the mainland based on the principle of " being positive and active , giving play to strong points , being complementary and mutually beneficial , and joint development .

Jiang Zemin spoke highly on the phone of Russia 's rapid economic development , political stability and positive role in international affairs under Putin 's leadership , while Putin expressed his support for the three major tasks outlined in Jiang Zemin 's New Year 's message . 
Analysts here hold that the visit made by the " three links " delegations of the Kuomintang and the New Party will be conducive to increasing the Taiwan people 's understanding of the mainland side 's position on cross-strait direct " three links " and its positive preparations , and also conducive to the joint efforts of the compatriots on both sides of the strait to promote the realization of the direct " three links " at an earlier date .  
In this way we can form and develop a positive and upward-looking public opinion environment throughout society , enable scientific theory and correct ideology to play the dominant role in social life activities , enable the cadres and masses to maintain good spiritual features , and continually consolidate and develop the basis of the common ideal of the people of all nationalities throughout the country in their united endeavors .

Undoubtedly , the positive changes in the situation on the Korean Peninsula were helpful in eliminating this hot spot in international society , and benefited the amelioration of the tense situation in Northeast Asia . Promoting regional economic development and prosperity at the same time also caused the excuse of the " North Korea threat , " and the so-called " defensive system , " to lose their power of persuasion .  
The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Japan have agreed with the fundamental interests of citizens of both countries .  At the same time , as the chief countries in the region , the fine development of Sino-Japanese relations has also made a positive contribution to peace and development in not only Asia but also in the entire world .  
Chang Lin-cheng said : Though this shows that the Taiwan side has unilaterally legalized the existing small-amount trade between the two shores , which had been previously banned by its law , and has lifted to a limited extent its ban on the Kinmen and Matsu residents visiting the mainland , since it has refused to make a positive response to one China , the introduction of the " mini three links " may on the contrary create more obstacles and will thus have only a limited impact on any substantial improvement in relations between the two shores .  
He added : Both sides made positive appraisals of the smooth development of their friendly cooperative relations in all fields in recent years .  They unanimously believe that there is great potential in Chinese-Italian relations , which also have bright prospects .  From now on , both sides should strengthen mutual visits between personnel , economic and trade cooperation , cultural exchanges , and cooperation in the judicial field , including making joint efforts in smashing organized crimes .

The comrades engaged in publicizing political and legal affairs and the comprehensive management of public order must solidly foster their political consciousness , as well as their awareness about the overall situation , responsibility , and position , continue to persist in highlighting the main trend , and uphold the predominance of unity , stability , exertion of efforts , and positive publicity in order to create a good public opinion atmosphere for reform , development , and the maintenance of stability .

We should seize the great opportunity of implementing the 10th Five-Year Plan ;

Du Qinglin held that Hainan 's development experience , both positive and negative , will provide useful reference for the province 's efforts to achieve the objectives of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  The main points are as follows : Always take economic construction as the central task , use the method of development to solve problems appearing in the course of advanced , guarantee both speed and efficiency , strive to push the economy onto a path of healthy and high-speed development ;

Meanwhile , eradicating the pernicious influence of " Falungong " heresy is also the compelling obligation of the Islamic circle .  It calls on the broad masses of Muslims to carry forward the fine tradition of Islam , take positive action and make contributions to building a stable and auspicious society without heresy .  
Under the guidance of this principle , the Chinese Government has implemented active measures , enhanced democracy at the grass-roots level , comprehensively carried out administration according to law , energetically developed judicial reform , raised the quality of law enforcement personnel , increased the degree of transparency in judicial matters , augmented supervision over law enforcement , severely punished graft and corruption in accordance with law , and achieved a series of positive progressions in completing the democratic legal system .  
The Republican-led government can not blindly imitate the China policies of the Clinton administration , nor can it go back to the doctrine of " strategic partnership . "  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .  
Jiang Zemin gave positive assessment to the development of bilateral relations between China and Djibouti over the past 22 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations , and expressed appreciation and gratitude to Djibouti for its consistent efforts to promote friendship with China and for the valuable support it gave to China for a long time over the Taiwan issue , the human rights issue , and other major international issues .  
Following the Asian financial crisis , the United States saw that China 's image as a major power is developing in a " positive direction " and [ that China ] is a responsible and cooperative big power .

So , just as last year 's policy address set a visionary and positive tone for our future in the wake of an extremely successful transition , this year 's address was soberly precise in its analysis of the current situation , pragmatic in its approach to tackling our problems , yet forward-looking and responsible in taking some of the concrete steps we need to find a new niche for ourselves in an ever-changing global economy .  
The spokesman commented that the narrowing of the visible trade deficit to such a small magnitude was a positive development , reflecting the adjustment process of the economy proceeding as retained imports were reduced in the light of the subdued local demand .  
Nothing else is more important .  Good education is central to developing the potential of our children so that they will learn to think independently and creatively , become mindful of social changes , and be equipped with the knowledge and skills which enable them to play an active role and a positive role in our society .  
Yet the spokesman observed that there were certain positive signs emerging more recently , including improved liquidity from the earlier tight situation , successive cuts in local interest rates , and rebound in share prices and flat prices .

He said , " I am glad to say that we have received very positive response from them : our universities are now developing and making available a number of tertiary level courses on-line to improve subject choice ; and establishing partnerships with higher education institutions overseas which would allow Hong Kong students to exploit a much bigger database of knowledge through electronic links and share in the educational experiences offered by overseas institutions .  
As to the conventional overseas markets , exports to the United States also rebounded to a strong positive growth , on the back of sustained robust consumer demand in the country and with the negative impact of the earlier currency depreciation of the East Asian economies gradually dissipated .  
( c ) The objective of developing the HKSCS is to collate Chinese characters which computer users need for practical purposes and which are not at present included in commonly used coding schemes in Hong Kong ( i.e . ISO 10646 and the Big-5 coding scheme ) .  In doing so , we seek to establish a common Chinese language interface so as to facilitate accurate electronic communication in Chinese . This has a positive effect on the development of Chinese computing .  
While the recovery was not yet broadly based , and much would depend on external developments , as well as the speed with which the remaining domestic price adjustment was completed and corporate profitability improved , Directors believed that the outlook for 2000 and beyond was generally positive .  
The positive BoP position was mainly underpinned by the improvement in the current account , as Hong Kong 's exports strengthened while imports were restrained .  This reflected the adjustment process continuing in the economy to restore external balance after the Asian financial turmoil .  
Investment spending resumed positive growth , at 5.6% in real terms in the first quarter of 2000 over a year earlier , after falling for six consecutive quarters , with the main impetus coming from the sharp rebound in machinery and equipment acquisition which more than offset the continued decline in building and construction output . 
The case came to light at about 11.10 pm yesterday when Customs officers conducting routine checking of containers at the terminal .

We should commit great efforts to the promotion of sports and cultural activities .  Our youth should be encouraged to participate actively in healthy activities for the development of a strong physique , a cultured mind , positive social values and a broad outlook .  
The 33 SSLOs are responsible for maintaining a close working relationship with social workers , school management and parents on prevention of juvenile crime , advising school authorities on the enforcement of the law regarding unruly behaviour of students as well as conducting group and individual discussions with students at risk to encourage them to take a positive view of life and refer suitable cases to relevant multi-agency programmes for follow-up action .  
Apart from the sustained current account surplus , the positive BoP position in the second quarter was also underpinned by a further net inflow of direct investment , signifying continued interest abroad in placing foreign direct investment in Hong Kong , even though concurrently there were net portfolio investment and other investment outflows .  
I look forward to the positive response and commitment of the community as a whole , in particular , parents and the business sector towards improving the quality of the local workforce so that Hong Kong would become a real knowledge-based economy and Hong Kong 's competitiveness on the global front may be enhanced . "

The Government has placed a lot of emphasis on youth development .  We push forward a wide range of youth programmes to foster all-round development of our young people .  We help them develop positive values , higher civic awareness , a sense of belonging to Hong Kong and a better understanding of our Chinese culture .  We encourage them to take active part in social development , broaden their horizon , develop an international outlook , and better equip themselves for the achievement of their personal goals .  
( c ) With the support of the Committee on the Promotion of Civic Education and the Commission on Youth , the Administration has been actively promoting civic awareness , social responsibility and positive values among the public , particularly young people , through various publicity channels , educational programmes and funding schemes .  The objective is to help nurture good citizenship and reduce the possibility of young people engaging in illicit activities .

The community has generally expressed positive comments to the Government 's announcement .  
Speaking after the meeting , the Secretary for Commerce , Industry and Technology , Mr Henry Tang said : " We are glad that this private sector initiative is gaining momentum and continual support with the positive response from the international and local chambers of commerce as well as other business and professional bodies .  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
( a ) One of the aims of the GS curriculum is to enable students to maintain healthy personal development to help them develop a healthy lifestyle .

The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
The " tea arrangements " are those which were used by ancient scholars to correlate with the simple pleasures of taking tea , and are therefore of a much more profound , and unobtrusive decorative character . Court arrangements are set in large , imposing vases . The flowers are arranged in even numbers and brilliant colors , their sanguine resplendence moving admirers with a powerfully positive expression of good fortune and happiness .  
Most of the changes are clearly positive ; however , some have caused us to take a second look at where we are going . Our government and people are now in the position of having to come up with quick answers to a wide range of new and challenging questions . Unlike many nations of the West that have had well over a century to gradually adjust to political and economic modernization , the Republic of China is having to compact this development into the short span of a few decades .  
Steadily Advancing Our Mainland Work " Building up Taiwan to recover the mainland " is a fundamental government policy . With the chief goals of our political call to the mainland being democracy , freedom , unification , and prosperity for all , we must advance our work in a steady , active , and positive manner while paying heed at all times to the political , economic , and social situation .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Chiang Hsiao-shan points out even though the vast majority of patients are open , extroverted , positive types with a considerable degree of self-confidence who are bold enough to want to change their image , the longing for a better appearance often involves tangled emotional complexes that are difficult to resolve , and most doctors must still carefully evaluate the patients who walk in their doors .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
Analyzing the replies more closely , we discovered that the positive opinions were mainly centered on such aspects as Japan 's good infrastructure and its people 's unity , law-abiding nature and efficiency , while negative opinions were mainly to do with the Japanese being aggressive , cruel , treacherous and materialistic .  
Analyzing the content of the replies , in fact the positive and negative replies do not contradict each other . In other words , almost all our interviewees acknowledged that the Japanese army was both " brave and loyal " ( towards Japan ) and " cruel and ruthless " ( towards the countries they invaded ) . The only difference was in whether they personally tended to like the Japanese for this , or despise them .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad .

" For fear of children getting ill , one ca n't simply deny the existence of germs , " says Wu Wu-tien . In his view , only by " immunizing " children-presenting them with a realistic view with both positive and negative examples , and so training their capacity for moral discernment and judgement-can one give them a mental rock to hold fast to when faced with all kinds of temptations , so that they are not easily led astray .  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
And while she did grapple with the idea prior to going ahead with the shooting , the spread 's publication elicited a nearly universally positive response , enabling Yu Ke-hsin to cast off the public image as " megastar Andy Lau 's former girlfriend " that had dogged her for so long .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  
While there are few examples of knights-errant with an overriding interest in justice , our recollection of one or two positive attributes dominates our image of these figures . The way we remember selfless Guo Jie and forget his more ruthless contemporaries is a case in point . When people feel oppressed , such idealization is still more common , and whenever China has been in decline the image of knight-errants has waxed bright in the popular mind .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
Peter Kurz , CEO of the investment consulting firm Insight Pacific , observes that although Taiwan 's non-performing loan ratio is increasing , the amount for dishonored checks and bills has not correspondingly risen . " This indicates , " he explains " that the rise in the non-performance ratio is a result of the government 's increasingly strict oversight of the financial sector , and the increasing transparency of bank operations , which in fact are positive things from the point of view of foreign investors . "  
Not only does this allow the government , which has in recent years been in dire financial straits , to strengthen social welfare policies , each week it gives birth to several newly wealthy individuals . Over the long run , this will certainly have a positive impact on stimulating consumption . Of course , many people are not very pleased with the fondness of Taiwanease for gambling and the reliance on luck , and even more are worried about the government being the " house " and everyone thinking only about money .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
" All told , Taiwan has over 70 free-to-air , cable and satellite TV stations . To put a positive gloss on it you could say this is a sign of a vibrant industry , but with such intense competition , many stations feel that producing drama series of their own is too costly and risky , so they prefer to buy ready-made Japanese , Korean or mainland offerings . With the large influx of drama from abroad , in fact the biggest losers have been Taiwanese film and TV production organizations , " laments Andy Wang .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
" Many people find that the up-close living arrangements of the past were painful for all concerned : the mother , the daughter-in-law and the son who was stuck in between , " notes Lu Lo , assistant professor of Department of Psychology at Fu-Jen Catholic University , who also has a positive take on modern views about filial piety .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
But the TCM Clinic finds itself under enormous pressure , because many of its patients present complex symptoms that have proven resistant to Western medicine . Such patients place great hopes in Chinese medicine and set deadlines for positive results . The clinic faces the formidable challenge of improving patients ' condition within three or four weeks of admission .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
China continued to play a positive role in multilateral activities and major international affairs , and participated in diplomatic activities of both the United Nations and regional organizations in a wide range of areas , contributing to world peace and common development , it says

Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
This Cairo Declaration should be regarded as a tributary providing the proper foundation for positive and practical international cooperation and flowing into the main stream of universal support for human rights and freedoms .

It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
We share the Secretary-General 's positive outlook , which is based on the prospect of the region 's being free of armed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable of supporting new programmes of social and economic reforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable development .  
In this connection , in the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation , international cooperation between the United Nations and the new democracies should not die out , but , on the contrary , should be reinforced , bearing in mind that every positive process , unfortunately , also has negative consequences , which must be neutralized and eliminated ; this can be achieved only through the united efforts of representatives of the world community . 
The IPU has played a very positive and active role in supporting United Nations efforts in various parts of the world , in various conflicts and in the fields of disarmament , international humanitarian law , economic and social development , the environment and the advancement of women , as well as its important role in enhancing democracy .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .  
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .

He noted that international justice required independence from the decisions of political organs , and that , in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .

Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
We cite in particular the call by the President of the Republic of Cyprus , Mr . Glafcos Clerides , who , during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Cyprus in October 1993 , urged the establishment of such a court and received a positive response by the other participants , who as is stated in the communiqu , " recognized that the successful culmination of this initiative could provide the international community with an important instrument against international crime " . 
Since the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women : Equality , Development and Peace , held at Nairobi in 1985 , and the adoption of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women , the world has experienced profound political , economic , social and cultural changes , which have had both positive and negative effects on women . 
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
We hope that Iraq will soon be in a position to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , so that there will be no need for this mechanism and so that Iraq may resume its regional and international role in the peaceful and positive manner that would enable the brotherly people of Iraq to overcome the years of hardship and to make up for their losses in the domain of economic and social development .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee and confirmed by the General Assembly resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council , that had withdrawn from the Ad Hoc Committee in 1989 , would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .

This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
This action by the international community , showing itself to be unequivocally in favour of democratic law in Sao Tome and Principe and of scrupulous respect for democratically elected sovereign organs , represented not only an invaluable contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Sao Tome and Principe , but also en example to be followed in all similar instances in any part of the world .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
A positive scenario for rapprochement between the people , its Government and the political parties would be the definition , with broad civil participation , of a national development strategy for the medium and long term , to which the main political forces and the Government were committed .  
NULLAs far as the internal situation in Burundi is concerned , the international community , which has so far played a positive role in preventing a wider conflict there , should continue to coordinate its efforts so that the message to the political leaders of Burundi is consistent and unanimous .  
In my view , however , the balance has been very positive - while each step taken by the Committee might have appeared to be modest , the cumulative result is that , in a mere three years , the international community managed to create a framework for concrete action to be taken in response to the common concern with the adverse effects of climate change .  
While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .

Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,

Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
addition to the positive elements , however , recent information received from both inside and outside Iraq gave rise to serious concern that , after the adoption of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , Iraq had continued to acquire components from abroad for its missile programmes and had conducted a clandestine programme on missiles capable of reaching beyond the 150-kilometre range , the limit laid down in Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .

The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
That Summit was the first international conference of the 1990s and reaffirmed that the rights of the child and the safeguarding of those rights by States and individuals help in achieving the physical , psychological and intellectual development of children , enabling them subsequently to make a positive contribution to creating a healthy society in which the rights of individuals and communities are respected .  
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
It is incomprehensible that while Argentina and the United Kingdom have overcome the sorrow and have left behind their mutual disagreements and distrust and built up a harmonious and constructive relationship and we see the positive results of this day by day they have not so far been able to comply with the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Decolonization Committee and to progress in the dialogue towards a definitive solution to this dispute .  
The convening of many international conferences in the past decade to articulate and codify further norms of behaviour for an orderly new system , the relative success of the United Nations machinery in preventing and de-escalating many international and regional conflicts , and the constructive debate on reinvigorating the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council are positive examples providing hopeful signals in that direction .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
If the amendment presented by Iraq , as contained in document A / 51 / L . 11 , concentrates only on positive aspects , we consider that operative paragraph 7 in its current formulation does not accurately reflect the delicate balance between positive and negative aspects , particularly as outlined by the Director General in his report and as stated in the IAEA resolution on the subject suggesting more positive than negative aspects .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan . 
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
Ratification of the Convention had also had a positive educational impact on the public , had satisfied a long-standing demand by women 's organizations and had stimulated legislative , administrative and other measures on the part of individual ministries .  
Her delegation was convinced that , in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Platform for Action , specific and positive policies must be formulated and applied at the national level .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,

In this respect , we regard as encouraging the agreement reached between the Government and UNITA to establish a new timetable in order to move the peace process forward , as well as the resumption of bilateral negotiations to complete the establishment of joint armed forces .  The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
My country welcomes the Secretary-General 's current report , which some contains very positive and encouraging elements regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti and congratulates UNMIH for the progress achieved during the fulfilment of its mandate , as set out in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) , to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a safe and stable climate , to protect international personnel and essential installations , to ensure the desired conditions for the holding of elections and to create a new professional police force .  
Among the positive developments during the past month are a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations ; a further reduction in hostile propaganda ; the release of additional prisoners registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ( while the Government has freed all 353 such prisoners held by it , UNITA has so far released 139 ) ; the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions ; and continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 out of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
In his latest report , the Secretary-General informed the Security Council , inter alia , that , subsequent to the visits by a number of foreign dignitaries and the adoption of Council resolution 1045 ( 1996 ) , there had been positive developments during February 1996 , including a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations , a further reduction in hostile propaganda , the release of additional prisoners , the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions and the continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
The Police Congress , which was attended by representatives of 33 police agencies from 27 countries , included debates on the following topics : ( a ) human resources , a competitive advantage in modern police operations ; ( b ) economic crime ; ( c ) terrorism : a strategy for its neutralization ; ( d ) information : its positive and / or negative effect on security and crime ; and ( e ) drug abuse and its incidence among children and youth .  
" Accuracy " : usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , defined as the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .  
" Linearity " ( usually measured in terms of non-linearity ) : maximum deviation of the actual characteristic ( average of upscale and downscale readings ) , positive or negative , from a straight line so positioned as to equalize and minimize the maximum deviations .  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
Links should be established or reinforced with media to avoid the negative reporting on children and youth in especially difficult circumstances and to further specific messages to enhance positive , social values fostering favourable conditions for accepting these children back into society .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
In its resolution 1996 / 59 of 19 April 1996 , the Commission expressed its satisfaction with the boost given to the negotiations which sought to achieve agreements on the pending items on the agenda , with the corresponding mechanisms for verification ; regretted the persistence of serious violations ; recognized the positive role played by MINUGUA in promoting the peace process ; and decided to request the extension of the mandate of the independent expert .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
The past year has seen the Tribunal take positive strides forward , tempered by the uneven cooperation which it has received from States and Entities of the former Yugoslavia and which , by the same token , tempers progress towards a new era of international implementation of humanitarian law .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
In the light of the very positive collaboration experienced by members of the Joint Committee through the Task Force on Information Activities for the Social Summit , convened by the Department of Public Information , it was agreed that the Joint Committee would establish a working group in New York which would meet monthly or bimonthly , as required .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
The most positive and promising development during the period has been the dialogue and agreements at the political level between the Commission and the Government of Iraq leading to mutual undertakings on such crucial issues as access to sites for inspection and interviews as well as to the establishment of a joint programme of action , containing an outline of priority tasks to be accomplished , as originally proposed in the Commission 's April 1996 report to the Security Council .  
This positive development now makes judicial corporal punishment for ordinary crimes a historical relic and may be expected substantially to reduce the incidence of such cruel , inhuman and degrading punishments .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
We hope that the effective cooperation between the two organizations in the field of the gradual development and codification of international law and in other areas of common concern can be further enhanced so that a positive contribution can be made to the promotion of friendly cooperation among countries , the maintenance of world peace and security , common prosperity for all societies , and the achievement of a just and sound new international order based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Lastly , the pay-offs through greater mutual understanding and confidence gained in subregional economic cooperation and factor mobility may be intangible , but they generate substantial positive , highly visible and collective external benefits for ED , networking and integration among the collaborating or participating countries in the long run .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Human Rights Committee , after having considered the initial report of Estonia ( CCPR / C / 79 / Add . 59 ) in October 1995 , had expressed satisfaction at the fundamental and positive changes in Estonia , which provided a better political , constitutional and legal framework for the implementation of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
However , the international community had a part to play , not by pointing an accusing finger or engaging in a sterile debate , but by participating in a constructive dialogue in order to achieve positive , practical results .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .  
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
The concept of an international crime was deeply rooted in contemporary positive law , and the distinction between crimes and delicts was a qualitative one between ordinary wrongful acts and serious wrongful acts which damaged the fundamental interests of the international community .  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .  
It is our hope that 1997 will see the progressive diminution of the remaining tensions and suspicions , and the fostering of a spirit of constructive and positive cooperation between the different communities , from which can grow lasting stability and economic prosperity based on mutual respect , democracy and the rule of law .  
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
With this positive landscape in international relations and expectations , the United Nations embarked upon a series of unprecedented global conferences addressing key issues facing mankind , ranging from environment , human rights , population , social development , women and human settlements to food security . 
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
National strategies of economic reform and international cooperation must incorporate strong concern for the social implications in order to enhance the positive and minimize the negative effects of the global economy .  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
Its programmes are geared towards providing Muslim children with information on Islamic culture and life , thus giving them the chance for a balanced understanding of their culture and the culture of the country in which they live , in order to enhance positive participation based on mutual understanding .  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
It has supported Palestinian women 's initiatives through an extensive network of institutions , including the work of the Women 's Center for Legal Aid and Counselling on gender sensitive amendments to legislation , the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Elections awareness-raising campaign for rural women , and the work of the Palestinian Coalition for Women 's Health . It has also encouraged activities that promote a positive representation of women in audio , visual and written media .  
The Special Representative accepts that incidents taken out of context can be misleading and indeed that the media - in any society - tend to give undue weight to the violent , to the outrageous , to the negative , to what they deem newsworthy , at the expense of the prosaic , the positive developments that are occurring in everyday life .  
Harnessing the positive potential of development and trade is also being developed in other key areas of the Convention , such as access to genetic resources ; intellectual property rights ; technology transfer ; and social and economic incentives .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
The United Nations to create an international legal basis for the process of redirecting nuclear missile potential to the objectives stipulated in Agenda 21 and to ensure the financing of an international expert analysis of the attendant positive and negative factors ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
Such provocative actions by the separatist leaders of the Armenians in Nagorny Karabakh , at a time when positive trends are emerging towards a just and decisive resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the granting of broad autonomy to Nagorny Karabakh , once again demonstrate that the separatists , consolidating the results of the aggression committed against Azerbaijan , intend to nullify the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk group of OSCE and thereby to destroy the peacemaking process . 
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
The somewhat positive performance by the service sectors is based on growth in the financial sector and , to a lesser extent , in community and personal services , as the preliminary figures for the remaining service sectors show negative movement .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Thus , while the Government of the Republic of Angola regrets once again the fact that , in spite of the numerous General Assembly resolutions , among others , not one positive measure has been taken to lift the embargo , it urges the international community to cooperate with the United Nations in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to that blockade , whose main victims are thousands of human beings who are forced to make extraordinary sacrifices and see their social and economic development hindered .  
Allow me to reiterate here the great importance of the support of the international community in assisting the member States of the Standing Advisory Committee to carry out the positive measures they have adopted , in a context that must be described as particularly difficult , in order to strengthen subregional security through increased cooperation , as is reflected in document A / 52 / 283 , which contains the report of the ninth ministerial meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee , held in Libreville , Gabon , from 7 to 11 July 1997 .  
After prolonged and difficult talks , the protocol concerning the redeployment in Hebron , concluded on 17 January 1997 , inspired the hope that confidence and mutual trust between Palestinians and Israelis would increase and create a positive environment for subsequent negotiations that could be successful .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
The European Union wishes again to express its appreciation of the positive way in which the United Nations has contributed to the Guatemala peace process by supporting the parties and encouraging them to bring about a firm and lasting peace and to work towards national reconciliation , so that the foundations of democracy and development may be laid in a climate of justice and freedom .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Lastly , with regard to the question of foreign debt , there is now broad agreement that without favourable treatment for the stock of African debt , particularly in the most heavily indebted countries , no economic recovery programme can produce the desired long-term positive effects .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
It is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two situations and described them as negative , without putting them within the proper context to which we referred to earlier , and without balancing them against the positive and consistent record of Iraq 's cooperation with the Special Commission and all its efforts in the implementation of its mandate as defined by the Security Council . 
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
There has been a rapid expansion in both formal and informal regional arrangements , driven in part by concerns over the potential negative impacts of globalization on national economies and by the positive prospects of regionalization .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
The meeting expressed , inter alia , appreciation for the neutral and impartial way in which the multinational protection force , acting under Security Council resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , carries out its mandate and for the positive results so far achieved in guaranteeing the safe arrival of humanitarian aid .  
The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The global plan of action , which sought to create the many new jobs required , especially in urban areas , specifically linked urban economic development to job creation and addressed the positive relationship between shelter and employment .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
During the discussions particular attention was paid to the positive role of the media as an instrument for the protection and promotion of the rights of persons belonging to minorities , as well as to the negative role the media could play by exacerbating problems involving minorities and latent ethnic , religious or racial tensions .  
I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
Peace needs to be considered , not as the absence of differences and conflicts , but as a positive , dynamic , participatory process linked intrinsically to democracy , justice and development for all by which differences are respected , dialogue is encouraged and conflicts are constantly transformed by non-violent means into new avenues of understanding and cooperation .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
But these bold reforms , whose positive macroeconomic results can already be measured , have rarely been accompanied by an improvement in the international environment and therefore have not allowed for a genuine economic take-off .  
In the view of the speakers , national and international responses are required to make globalization an overall positive development so that the quality of life both economic welfare and the enjoyment of cultural heritage of all people may be improved .  
The evaluations show that a major factor for achieving positive results is the availability of a critical mass of financial resources in order for the national programmes that the United Nations system is supporting to be effective .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
To the extent that globalization has enabled some countries to attract external investment leading to accelerated economic growth and thus an expanded revenue base , it has had a potentially positive impact on social provision .  
The Subcommittee recognized the positive impact of the IMF initiative towards the long-term goal of improving data quality ; in particular , the potential of GDDS to serve as a master plan for statistical development was mentioned .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
It was projected that at the end of 1998 , combined cash would total $ 528-million , based on regular budget cash of negative $ 247-million and peacekeeping positive balances of $ 775-million .  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session in 1997 , urged Governments to consider the positive and negative impact of subsidies on the conservation and management of fisheries through national , regional and appropriate international organizations , and based on those analyses to consider appropriate action .  
We look forward to participating actively and constructively at the coming preparatory meeting for the 2000 Review Conference , which in our view should recoup the ground lost at previous meetings and resume the positive spirit and substantive role with which the strengthened review process started in 1995 .  
This relates to the complex question of international and national transfers to internalize positive externalities by supporting forest-based sustainable livelihoods of the rural poor .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .  There were , however , a number of issues that needed to be clarified and settled .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
The major objective of the subprogramme is to promote an informed and positive public understanding of the activities of the United Nations and help build broad-based global support for the Organizations goals by highlighting the priority issues of concern to the international community .

A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
This is a notion that has been deeply ingrained in the conceptual development , positive normativity and consistent jurisprudence of both municipal and international law since Roman Law was at its zenith more than five centuries ago , when modern European colonization began .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Nevertheless , determined as I believe we should be to go ahead , undeterred by the intimidation , and in view of the need to adhere to the shortest possible time-frame , I have decided to begin the registration , based on positive assurances by the Indonesian authorities , on the condition that meaningful , visible improvements in the security situation will be observed in the immediate future .  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
Despite positive developments linked to the creation of the PA and removal of restrictions from the occupation period , economic activities were adversely affected and the interim period has been characterized by prolonged decline in the standard of living , with high and fluctuating unemployment .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .

Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
The positive effects of air transport on the immediate living conditions of the very poor can readily be seen in the emergency distribution of essential foods , medicines and other commodities , and in the transport of health and social workers to remote locations where traditional means of transport are often impractical or impossible .  
We are sure that , given your skilful and widely recognized abilities and leadership , our deliberations will reach a positive conclusion that will be highly beneficial to the international community , and particularly to the nations deprived of free and sovereign access to the sea .

C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .

Despite the scope of the challenges facing countries as a result of globalization , he was confident that the phenomenon was a vehicle for positive changes of benefit to humankind as a whole , since they fostered democratic systems of government that respected human dignity and encouraged countries to be responsible members of a more peaceful international community .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
Despite the positive developments connected with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , economic activities had been adversely affected by a prolonged fall in living conditions , high unemployment and border closures , which led to an internal geographic separation of the occupied Palestinian territory .

Although , as reiterated in the Security Council resolutions , all acts of the Abkhaz separatists contravening the sovereign rights of Georgia are null and void , due consideration has to be given to the fact that they have established a consistent pattern of behaviour , directed against attempts to intensify international efforts to diffuse tensions and to secure positive developments in implementing confidence-building measures . 
The ambivalence in capitalist development analysed by great theoreticians has in general been confirmed by historical experience : positive and negative , creative and destructive , beneficial and detrimental features are combined in this system , and their relative weights have been changing at different times and in different national and international contexts .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasising also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,

In a sense , our endeavour to define and , indeed , to promote human security has philosophical and practical implications both positive and negative for us as sovereign States and for the United Nations as the leading global multilateral Organization .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
While international assistance and debt relief are clearly important , their positive effects depend on sound national efforts towards economic and structural reform and good governance , under which the private sector and civil society are able to play productive roles .  
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .

A positive development at the national level is the establishment of ethics committees to supervise scientific activity , to foresee and prevent possible excesses , to alert the authorities and public opinion , and to act in an advisory capacity to assist public authorities as well as scientific researchers and their professional organizations .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
Research and development networks were a vital way for research institutes and firms in developing countries to leverage their knowledge base with respect to new technologies , including environmentally sound technologies , while partnerships amongst firms in close proximity made possible the creation of the positive externalities such as training programmes and testing laboratories that were needed to meet the new quality standards .  
It is under these circumstances that Ethiopia would find it difficult to consider these latest statements by the international community , though encouraging and positive , sufficiently forthright and commensurate with the gravity of the situation we face , which is made all the more serious in light of the continuing Eritrean attempt at expanding its occupation and its war of aggression .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .

Certain basic principles are important for the dialogue among civilizations to be positive and effective and to attain its desired goals , foremost of which is respect for cultural diversity , based on human dignity and equality among individuals .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
The concept of human rights prevailing among the political elite bore the negative imprint of certain traditions ; accordingly , any policy aimed at the promotion of human rights should incorporate some positive traditional values . 
The initial promise of deep , continuous and irreversible reductions in strategic nuclear forces held out by the positive climate of the early postcoldwar years appears to be fading fast .

Following positive reactions from a number of Governments and international organizations , BTF carried out a detailed feasibility study to define the exact scientific and associated financial requirements for the humanitarian cleanup of the hot spots .  
The key to the successful and effective implementation of the positive initiatives contained in the report lay in a clear delineation of the exact role and responsibility of the central review body and of the Office of Human Resources Management .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
In this regard , we call on the Security Council and the international community to redouble their efforts to convince the Government of Iraq to be more forthcoming and positive in addressing this issue and to resolve the entire matter on humanitarian , religious and moral grounds and in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions .  
While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day . 
Confident of the contributions that Bahrain , under the leadership of its Amir , His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa , can make to consolidating and strengthening the GCC process during its presidency of the Councils forthcoming session in order to guide it towards new horizons that will enable it to cope in a positive manner with the rapid and continuous changes required by the process of globalization at the political , economic , social and cultural levels ,

" Upon completing the trial , TD found that most of the motorists would slow down when approaching the road markings .  " We have also received positive feedback from the public that the 50 km / h speed limit road marking is effective and should be extended to other suitable locations in the territory , " the spokesman said .  
The Chairman of the Community Partnership Committee , Mr Wan Man-yee , said that in addition to getting participants better acquainted with common health problems , the series of programmes emphasise individual responsibility for personal health , adoption of a healthy lifestyle , such as a balanced diet , regular physical exercise , a positive outlook on life , continued community participation and lifelong learning .  
The replacement of HOS flats by housing loans aims at a clearer role for both public and private sector housing markets , and provides a more certain operating environment to the private property market .  This policy is keeping in line with the prevailing political , social and economic reality of Hong Kong , and strikes a balance between the interests of the general public and people from various sectors .  The community has generally expressed positive comments to the Government 's announcement .  
Speaking after the meeting , the Secretary for Commerce , Industry and Technology , Mr Henry Tang said : " We are glad that this private sector initiative is gaining momentum and continual support with the positive response from the international and local chambers of commerce as well as other business and professional bodies .  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
( a ) One of the aims of the GS curriculum is to enable students to maintain healthy personal development to help them develop a healthy lifestyle .  Through the study of GS , students can acquire some basic understanding of the physical , psychological and social aspects of health , possess a positive attitude towards their personal growth and development , and make informed decisions related to their health and safety .  
" We have attached great importance to the moral and healthy development of our students .  Through a variety of learning activities , students are provided with amble opportunities to develop positive values and attitudes , healthy lifestyles and critical thinking skills to handle the problems arising from their daily encounters and social issues , " an EMB spokesman said .  
The former approach , used by athletes , falls under the psychological heading of image therapy . Requiring no physical activity to reach its goal , the method might be considered a type of positive thinking exercise . Pleasant experiences are reinforced , and negative stimuli are reduced to a bare minimum .  
The " tea arrangements " are those which were used by ancient scholars to correlate with the simple pleasures of taking tea , and are therefore of a much more profound , and unobtrusive decorative character . Court arrangements are set in large , imposing vases . The flowers are arranged in even numbers and brilliant colors , their sanguine resplendence moving admirers with a powerfully positive expression of good fortune and happiness .  
Most of the changes are clearly positive ; however , some have caused us to take a second look at where we are going . Our government and people are now in the position of having to come up with quick answers to a wide range of new and challenging questions . Unlike many nations of the West that have had well over a century to gradually adjust to political and economic modernization , the Republic of China is having to compact this development into the short span of a few decades .  
Steadily Advancing Our Mainland Work " Building up Taiwan to recover the mainland " is a fundamental government policy . With the chief goals of our political call to the mainland being democracy , freedom , unification , and prosperity for all , we must advance our work in a steady , active , and positive manner while paying heed at all times to the political , economic , and social situation .  
As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
Kuo Li-hsin , a lecturer in the Department of Broadcasting and Television of National Chengchih University , argues that at this point it 's hard to say what negative or positive value it will have , but if the audience is just satisfied with this outlet , and abandons normal channels of political participation , such as lowering willingness to vote , then " this might not be such a good thing for political participation itself , " he points out , raising an alternate possibility .  
Chiang Hsiao-shan points out even though the vast majority of patients are open , extroverted , positive types with a considerable degree of self-confidence who are bold enough to want to change their image , the longing for a better appearance often involves tangled emotional complexes that are difficult to resolve , and most doctors must still carefully evaluate the patients who walk in their doors .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
In Fukienese rural villages , besides celebrations of the gods which have economic benefits in mind , state-sponsored dramatic operations have the responsibility of spreading the official line , as for example in modern dramas encouraging birth control or extolling some new positive and condemning the corresponding negative . These accompany the traditionally-costumed Hsiang Opera and are performed everywhere in turn .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
Because the open style of our questions elicited a wide variety of opinions , expressed in an even greater variety of ways , for ease of statistical presentation we have combined the answers into various broad categories such as positive , negative or neutral , while reflecting the more detailed content in narrative form .  
Analyzing the replies more closely , we discovered that the positive opinions were mainly centered on such aspects as Japan 's good infrastructure and its people 's unity , law-abiding nature and efficiency , while negative opinions were mainly to do with the Japanese being aggressive , cruel , treacherous and materialistic .  
Analyzing the content of the replies , in fact the positive and negative replies do not contradict each other . In other words , almost all our interviewees acknowledged that the Japanese army was both " brave and loyal " ( towards Japan ) and " cruel and ruthless " ( towards the countries they invaded ) . The only difference was in whether they personally tended to like the Japanese for this , or despise them .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
The idea of " mindset " should not be limited to " positive thinking , " as emphasized by Haruyama . It also should include imagination , which can far transcend the practical realities of society . Thought patterns characterized by imagination are unrestrained by ordinary standards , and do not bow down to " reality . " This is a way of thinking that emphasizes the future and creativity .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
He established close relations with Yen Hsi-shan . The positive and negative effects of this relationship canceled each other out . In 1948 Yen rescued him from a KMT prison ( his crime was correctly forecasting in print where the Communists would cross the Yangzi River ) . The following year when he visited Kunming to pick up his family , the Communists suspected that he was sent by Yen Hsi-shan on a political mission , and this almost cost him his life .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
" For fear of children getting ill , one ca n't simply deny the existence of germs , " says Wu Wu-tien . In his view , only by " immunizing " children-presenting them with a realistic view with both positive and negative examples , and so training their capacity for moral discernment and judgement-can one give them a mental rock to hold fast to when faced with all kinds of temptations , so that they are not easily led astray .  
The visit has undoubtedly helped to promote a deeper understanding of Taiwan on the other side of the Taiwan Strait . In the midst of these positive signs , however , China surprised Taiwan by resuming diplomatic relations on 23 April with Guinea Bissau . This development was a slap in the face for Taiwan , which has lost diplomatic relations with yet another country . This naked reminder of China 's unflagging campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally makes a mockery of budding hopes for improved cross-strait relations .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
Wang argues that practical reality has forced men to come up with a new self-image . " The new man idea has put a positive spin on caring for one 's family and sharing the housework . It has transformed traditional ideas that such behavior is the result of ' letting the wife wear the pants in the family ' or of the wife keeping the husband ' on a short leash . ' It has given men a way to gracefully retreat , and supported them in putting down old roles and adapting to change . "  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
And while she did grapple with the idea prior to going ahead with the shooting , the spread 's publication elicited a nearly universally positive response , enabling Yu Ke-hsin to cast off the public image as " megastar Andy Lau 's former girlfriend " that had dogged her for so long .  
The straightforward , confident , and unrestrained A-Mei has made quite a splash in the Chinese-speaking world . Perhaps it is not surprising that someone with such a distinctive personality would elicit strong feelings both positive and negative . Wang Dong is not alone in his views , for many in the mainland have asked how long A-Mei will continue her spectacular run of success . Hopefully she will always " speak " straight from the heart , and can keep that natural verve that set her apart from the crowd in the first place .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
Lee Juh-feng , a New Party Legislative Yuan member who twice lost in Kinmen County administrator elections , says that although clans perform many positive functions in Kinmen society , the dominance of clans over the exercise of political power has meant that people from minor clans frequently can only play the role of junior ally or balancer and find it hard to rise to prominence themselves . The impact this has had on Kinmen is as severe as the influence of ethnic identity on Taiwan .  
The main points include : mutual respect and mutual love , positive use of language and prohibition of domestic violence , equal contributions to the family by the husband and wife , prohibition of seeing the children as instruments for the realization of the parents ' own ambitions , acceptance of the monogamous marriage system , cultivation of concern and caring in the course of ordinary married life , filial respect for one 's own parents and for the parents of the partner , and cultivation of artistic interests outside of one 's profession .  
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links . In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties . In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .  
While there are few examples of knights-errant with an overriding interest in justice , our recollection of one or two positive attributes dominates our image of these figures . The way we remember selfless Guo Jie and forget his more ruthless contemporaries is a case in point . When people feel oppressed , such idealization is still more common , and whenever China has been in decline the image of knight-errants has waxed bright in the popular mind .  
The main principle agreed upon for cross-strait economic relations amounts to only four words - " proactive opening , effective supervision " - but they have brought new hope to business and confidence to the public . They have even attracted the attention of the international media . This is seen as both a political victory for the Chen administration , and an opportunity for a fresh start in cross-strait relations-a positive development for regional peace .  
Peter Kurz , CEO of the investment consulting firm Insight Pacific , observes that although Taiwan 's non-performing loan ratio is increasing , the amount for dishonored checks and bills has not correspondingly risen . " This indicates , " he explains " that the rise in the non-performance ratio is a result of the government 's increasingly strict oversight of the financial sector , and the increasing transparency of bank operations , which in fact are positive things from the point of view of foreign investors . "  
Not only does this allow the government , which has in recent years been in dire financial straits , to strengthen social welfare policies , each week it gives birth to several newly wealthy individuals . Over the long run , this will certainly have a positive impact on stimulating consumption . Of course , many people are not very pleased with the fondness of Taiwanease for gambling and the reliance on luck , and even more are worried about the government being the " house " and everyone thinking only about money .  
David Hong states that most of the researchers at TIER have MA degrees , and their salaries are paid in accordance with Ministry of Education regulations , based on the degree held by the employee . But this is a lot less money than they could make in the private sector , so talented people go into corporate life , which naturally affects the success of think tanks at fulfilling their role or accumulating a pool of human resources . The rising number of think tanks has had negative as well as positive effects .  
" All told , Taiwan has over 70 free-to-air , cable and satellite TV stations . To put a positive gloss on it you could say this is a sign of a vibrant industry , but with such intense competition , many stations feel that producing drama series of their own is too costly and risky , so they prefer to buy ready-made Japanese , Korean or mainland offerings . With the large influx of drama from abroad , in fact the biggest losers have been Taiwanese film and TV production organizations , " laments Andy Wang .  
Homeschoolers , meanwhile , take issue with outsiders ' criticisms that the sheltered environment of homeschooling might leave children deficient in skills of social adaptability . " Of course children should be protected when they are most impressionable , " says Kao Wei-chien . In his view , if you wait until children have developed sufficient powers of resistance before letting them out in the world , then they will have a positive impact on society , rather than be led astray by it .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
" Many people find that the up-close living arrangements of the past were painful for all concerned : the mother , the daughter-in-law and the son who was stuck in between , " notes Lu Lo , assistant professor of Department of Psychology at Fu-Jen Catholic University , who also has a positive take on modern views about filial piety .  
In fact , instead of worrying about how to raise a " devoted child , " modern parents should be pondering how to treat a child with kindness so as to encourage positive growth and avoid giving a child negative influences that will cause social problems in the future .  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
But the TCM Clinic finds itself under enormous pressure , because many of its patients present complex symptoms that have proven resistant to Western medicine . Such patients place great hopes in Chinese medicine and set deadlines for positive results . The clinic faces the formidable challenge of improving patients ' condition within three or four weeks of admission .  
In an era of strong environmental consciousness , when reports of disasters are frequent , naturally a land-use policy that gives the environment central importance is going to get a generally positive response . But because the government actually promoted mountain agriculture for half a century , now hundreds of thousands of farmers and workers in related industries depend on it for their livelihood , and there is also the question of the cultural and historic needs of Aborigines who call the mountain forests home .  
China continued to play a positive role in multilateral activities and major international affairs , and participated in diplomatic activities of both the United Nations and regional organizations in a wide range of areas , contributing to world peace and common development , it says  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing

On the positive side , a small number of States have taken steps to introduce adequate regulation and control of licit supplies as an essential component of a comprehensive national master plan .  
Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the major nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war , there is still a need to establish a close link between disarmament and international peace in the years ahead .  
This Cairo Declaration should be regarded as a tributary providing the proper foundation for positive and practical international cooperation and flowing into the main stream of universal support for human rights and freedoms .  
The very positive response to his intensive activity in his first year of office showed that flexible , discreet and authoritative advice based on broad international support is one of the promising answers to our new challenges .  
Notwithstanding , real GDP registered a negative growth rate of minus 2.8 per cent in 1992 against a planned positive growth rate of 2 per cent as the deterioration in the economic situation was compounded by drought .  
It is therefore essential that the specific problems of large cities be recognized and addressed , in full awareness of the positive contribution that large cities make to national economic and social development .  
Greater efforts should be made to create a more positive and balanced public image of the United Nations , encompassing not only political and peacekeeping activities but also its economic and social achievements .  
Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
International justice required independence from the decisions of political organs ; in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
" Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
We share the Secretary-General 's positive outlook , which is based on the prospect of the region 's being free of armed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable of supporting new programmes of social and economic reforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable development .  
In this connection , in the opinion of the Ukrainian delegation , international cooperation between the United Nations and the new democracies should not die out , but , on the contrary , should be reinforced , bearing in mind that every positive process , unfortunately , also has negative consequences , which must be neutralized and eliminated ; this can be achieved only through the united efforts of representatives of the world community . 
The IPU has played a very positive and active role in supporting United Nations efforts in various parts of the world , in various conflicts and in the fields of disarmament , international humanitarian law , economic and social development , the environment and the advancement of women , as well as its important role in enhancing democracy .  
The challenge the international community now faces is threefold : to ensure that recent positive developments do not founder for lack of economic and political support , to nurture progress on the other bilateral tracks of negotiations to match that achieved between Israel and the PLO and to prevent acts of violence and terrorism by extremist groups that seek to endanger the peace process and threaten to drive the Middle East back into conflict and suffering .  
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
Recognizing that it is primarily responsible for its own development , and in keeping with commitments entered into under UN-NADAF , Africa has recently become involved in far-reaching and difficult reforms designed to accelerate the process of democratization , promote human rights and achieve economic , social and cultural development , in a climate of transparency and with the active participation of all positive forces .  
Zainuddin ( Malaysia ) : My delegation echoes previous speakers in welcoming the desire and commitment of Turkmenistan to play a constructive role in the development of peaceful , friendly and mutually beneficial relations with other members of the international community on the basis of the principles of positive neutrality .  
Garc \ x { 71f0 } ( Colombia ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In view of the positive changes that have recently taken place internationally the relaxation of tensions at the global level and the emergence of a new spirit governing relations among nations the way has been paved for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of ( a ) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium ; ( b ) priorities , reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature ; ( c ) real growth , positive or negative , compared with the previous budget ; and ( d ) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources ;  
Priorities have to be assigned , using the Programme of Action as a guide , among potential topics - for example , certain aspects of human sexuality , sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS , preparation for family life , promoting the status of women , developing among girls a positive and future-oriented self-image , the dynamics and implications of rapid urbanization , male responsibility and so forth .

Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , and especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development ,  
He noted that international justice required independence from the decisions of political organs , and that , in the current state of positive international law , only by adopting the draft Code could there be a principal basis for the law to be applied by the future court .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
The Secretary-General is committed to a collegial , friendly and positive atmosphere in staff / management relations conducive to quality work at a level of productivity in line with staff qualifications and with the Organization 's changing mandates .  
In a document UNCHS prepared for the Conference , on population , urbanization and quality of life , it underlined the positive effects of urbanization on social change and modernization , on fertility , mortality and other demographic trends , on personal and household income levels and on the general economic development of both the rural and urban areas .  
Ensure that structural adjustment programmes are so designed as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and communities , while ensuring their positive effects on such groups and communities by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities and devising measures to ensure that they gain access to and control over economic resources and economic and social activities ; actions should be taken to reduce inequality and economic disparity ;  
We cite in particular the call by the President of the Republic of Cyprus , Mr . Glafcos Clerides , who , during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Cyprus in October 1993 , urged the establishment of such a court and received a positive response by the other participants , who as is stated in the communiqu , " recognized that the successful culmination of this initiative could provide the international community with an important instrument against international crime " . 
Since the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women : Equality , Development and Peace , held at Nairobi in 1985 , and the adoption of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women , the world has experienced profound political , economic , social and cultural changes , which have had both positive and negative effects on women . 
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed so as to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to ensure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
We hope that Iraq will soon be in a position to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , so that there will be no need for this mechanism and so that Iraq may resume its regional and international role in the peaceful and positive manner that would enable the brotherly people of Iraq to overcome the years of hardship and to make up for their losses in the domain of economic and social development .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
" I informed them that it was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee and confirmed by the General Assembly resolution , that the renewed participation of the three permanent members of the Security Council , that had withdrawn from the Ad Hoc Committee in 1989 , would be most conducive to the success of the work of the Committee and added that I would welcome the views of those Governments , whether positive or negative , on how best we could proceed in this matter .

This step taken by the international community following the signing by the Government and UNITA of the Lusaka Protocol , the new instrument setting forth the legal framework for the country 's transition from war to peace , gave a major boost to the peace process and helped curtail initial pessimism as did the positive unfolding of such a difficult and complex process , shrouded at first in a climate of deeply held mutual mistrust and hostility rooted in a long , destructive war .  
Regrettably , we must note that in Croatia the initial positive reaction to this initiative has been abandoned , and they have proved to be unprepared to begin a direct peaceful dialogue .  
This action by the international community , showing itself to be unequivocally in favour of democratic law in Sao Tome and Principe and of scrupulous respect for democratically elected sovereign organs , represented not only an invaluable contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Sao Tome and Principe , but also en example to be followed in all similar instances in any part of the world .  
The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
In many cases , structural adjustment programmes have not been designed to minimize their negative effects on vulnerable and disadvantaged groups or on women , nor have they been designed to assure positive effects on those groups by preventing their marginalization in economic and social activities .  
A positive scenario for rapprochement between the people , its Government and the political parties would be the definition , with broad civil participation , of a national development strategy for the medium and long term , to which the main political forces and the Government were committed .  
NULLAs far as the internal situation in Burundi is concerned , the international community , which has so far played a positive role in preventing a wider conflict there , should continue to coordinate its efforts so that the message to the political leaders of Burundi is consistent and unanimous .  
In my view , however , the balance has been very positive - while each step taken by the Committee might have appeared to be modest , the cumulative result is that , in a mere three years , the international community managed to create a framework for concrete action to be taken in response to the common concern with the adverse effects of climate change .  
While , for example , the value of training prison guards in human rights standards and techniques and providing expert assistance in the drafting of humane prison regulations remain clear priorities of the programme , such inputs lose substantial potential for positive impact if the guards , however well trained , and the regulations , however humane , are set in the context of substandard facilities and inhumane physical conditions .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
To ensure a positive and smooth peace process in Afghanistan , the Islamic State of Afghanistan requests you to press the Pakistani Government to put an end to this blatant meddling in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and stop the barbaric and inhumane rocket attacks upon the innocent people of Kabul and on public establishments .

Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,

also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
addition to the positive elements , however , recent information received from both inside and outside Iraq gave rise to serious concern that , after the adoption of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , Iraq had continued to acquire components from abroad for its missile programmes and had conducted a clandestine programme on missiles capable of reaching beyond the 150-kilometre range , the limit laid down in Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
The economic and social gap between the nations of the world is still wide in spite of positive political and economic developments on the regional and international scene , the creation of economic blocs , and free trade in the world .  
The consolidation of democracy and the construction of a State based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are positive results of the activities of the international community , as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as well as in the decisions and recommendations handed down by several conferences organized under United Nations auspices or with its support . 
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
That Summit was the first international conference of the 1990s and reaffirmed that the rights of the child and the safeguarding of those rights by States and individuals help in achieving the physical , psychological and intellectual development of children , enabling them subsequently to make a positive contribution to creating a healthy society in which the rights of individuals and communities are respected .  
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
It is incomprehensible that while Argentina and the United Kingdom have overcome the sorrow and have left behind their mutual disagreements and distrust and built up a harmonious and constructive relationship and we see the positive results of this day by day they have not so far been able to comply with the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Decolonization Committee and to progress in the dialogue towards a definitive solution to this dispute .  
The convening of many international conferences in the past decade to articulate and codify further norms of behaviour for an orderly new system , the relative success of the United Nations machinery in preventing and de-escalating many international and regional conflicts , and the constructive debate on reinvigorating the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council are positive examples providing hopeful signals in that direction .  
Honduras is a firm believer in the fact that cooperation between the two organizations constitutes positive progress towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region , allowing the countries there to have a broader forum for discussion and negotiation in the search for solutions to economic , social , cultural , political and humanitarian problems and respect for human rights .  
As this is based on a harmonious cultural hegemony that serves as a solid foundation for the defense of human rights , it is clear that there is a strong political will , public opinion and social awareness in favour of positive action .  
If the amendment presented by Iraq , as contained in document A / 51 / L . 11 , concentrates only on positive aspects , we consider that operative paragraph 7 in its current formulation does not accurately reflect the delicate balance between positive and negative aspects , particularly as outlined by the Director General in his report and as stated in the IAEA resolution on the subject suggesting more positive than negative aspects .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
The dawning in the Middle East and the new climate in Palestinian-Israeli relations quickly had a positive impact by breathing fresh life into the region , and as a result Israel and Jordan have established formal diplomatic relations and Syria and Israel have held several talks on substantive issues relating to the occupied Syrian Golan . 
Our positive vote , based on the reasons I have just expressed , reflects Ecuador 's unwavering position of rejection and repudiation of the occupation or annexation of territory by force , as well as its firm conviction that a peaceful and negotiated settlement of territorial disputes between States must be reached without the threat of force , in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law .  
Ratification of the Convention had also had a positive educational impact on the public , had satisfied a long-standing demand by women 's organizations and had stimulated legislative , administrative and other measures on the part of individual ministries .  
Her delegation was convinced that , in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Platform for Action , specific and positive policies must be formulated and applied at the national level .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
In this respect , we regard as encouraging the agreement reached between the Government and UNITA to establish a new timetable in order to move the peace process forward , as well as the resumption of bilateral negotiations to complete the establishment of joint armed forces .  The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
Also noting that despite the positive developments in the political and military situation in Angola , the economic , social and humanitarian situation remains dire , and reaffirming both the importance of and the need for a continued and effective United Nations presence in promoting a negotiated settlement in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process ,  
The fact is that subsidies may generate negative as well as positive economic and environmental effects , and the distributive consequences of removing subsidies also need to be considered : their net effect on economic and environmental welfare is thus an empirical question .  
My country welcomes the Secretary-General 's current report , which some contains very positive and encouraging elements regarding the United Nations Mission in Haiti and congratulates UNMIH for the progress achieved during the fulfilment of its mandate , as set out in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) , to assist the Haitian Government in maintaining a safe and stable climate , to protect international personnel and essential installations , to ensure the desired conditions for the holding of elections and to create a new professional police force .  
Among the positive developments during the past month are a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations ; a further reduction in hostile propaganda ; the release of additional prisoners registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) ( while the Government has freed all 353 such prisoners held by it , UNITA has so far released 139 ) ; the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions ; and continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 out of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
In his latest report , the Secretary-General informed the Security Council , inter alia , that , subsequent to the visits by a number of foreign dignitaries and the adoption of Council resolution 1045 ( 1996 ) , there had been positive developments during February 1996 , including a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations , a further reduction in hostile propaganda , the release of additional prisoners , the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions and the continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
The Police Congress , which was attended by representatives of 33 police agencies from 27 countries , included debates on the following topics : ( a ) human resources , a competitive advantage in modern police operations ; ( b ) economic crime ; ( c ) terrorism : a strategy for its neutralization ; ( d ) information : its positive and / or negative effect on security and crime ; and ( e ) drug abuse and its incidence among children and youth .  
" Accuracy " : usually measured in terms of inaccuracy , defined as the maximum deviation , positive or negative , of an indicated value from an accepted standard or true value .  
" Linearity " ( usually measured in terms of non-linearity ) : maximum deviation of the actual characteristic ( average of upscale and downscale readings ) , positive or negative , from a straight line so positioned as to equalize and minimize the maximum deviations .  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
" For if I were to sum things up , I would say that , during this relatively short period , we must move from the current consensus which is still based largely on the rejection of certain tendencies of the past or of certain developments that were unanimously rejected first , to a positive consensus on what we are all prepared to accept , and then , to an active consensus on the solution which we will have to uphold together , side by side , before the Caledonian public .  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
It may be noted that , at this stage , the average for the first four months of the biennium shows no variance between the actual and budgeted exchange rates for the largest currency involved ( Swiss franc ) vis - - vis the United States dollar but , as at the current date , that currency has significantly weakened relative to the dollar , a situation which , if it continues during the remaining course of the biennium , would be a positive factor .  
Links should be established or reinforced with media to avoid the negative reporting on children and youth in especially difficult circumstances and to further specific messages to enhance positive , social values fostering favourable conditions for accepting these children back into society .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
In its resolution 1996 / 59 of 19 April 1996 , the Commission expressed its satisfaction with the boost given to the negotiations which sought to achieve agreements on the pending items on the agenda , with the corresponding mechanisms for verification ; regretted the persistence of serious violations ; recognized the positive role played by MINUGUA in promoting the peace process ; and decided to request the extension of the mandate of the independent expert .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
The past year has seen the Tribunal take positive strides forward , tempered by the uneven cooperation which it has received from States and Entities of the former Yugoslavia and which , by the same token , tempers progress towards a new era of international implementation of humanitarian law .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
In the light of the very positive collaboration experienced by members of the Joint Committee through the Task Force on Information Activities for the Social Summit , convened by the Department of Public Information , it was agreed that the Joint Committee would establish a working group in New York which would meet monthly or bimonthly , as required .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
While there was no doubt that cases of victimization of women migrant workers existed , to provide a more balanced approach and to better determine the situation of women migrant workers as a whole , positive indicators should also be included , on matters such as where women migrant workers extended or renewed their employment ; their motivation for staying ; net benefits perceived by women migrant workers ; remittances received in sending countries .  
AL-ADHAMI ( Iraq ) , referring to the report of the Special Committee , observed in connection with chapter III , concerning the maintenance of international peace and security , that the working paper submitted by the Russian Federation contained many positive elements .  That paper , which mainly concerned the sanctions regime and its humanitarian dimension , was consistent with the provisions of the Charter and thus disregarded all political considerations and selfish interests .  
The most positive and promising development during the period has been the dialogue and agreements at the political level between the Commission and the Government of Iraq leading to mutual undertakings on such crucial issues as access to sites for inspection and interviews as well as to the establishment of a joint programme of action , containing an outline of priority tasks to be accomplished , as originally proposed in the Commission 's April 1996 report to the Security Council .  
This positive development now makes judicial corporal punishment for ordinary crimes a historical relic and may be expected substantially to reduce the incidence of such cruel , inhuman and degrading punishments .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
We hope that the effective cooperation between the two organizations in the field of the gradual development and codification of international law and in other areas of common concern can be further enhanced so that a positive contribution can be made to the promotion of friendly cooperation among countries , the maintenance of world peace and security , common prosperity for all societies , and the achievement of a just and sound new international order based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
Lastly , the pay-offs through greater mutual understanding and confidence gained in subregional economic cooperation and factor mobility may be intangible , but they generate substantial positive , highly visible and collective external benefits for ED , networking and integration among the collaborating or participating countries in the long run .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Human Rights Committee , after having considered the initial report of Estonia ( CCPR / C / 79 / Add . 59 ) in October 1995 , had expressed satisfaction at the fundamental and positive changes in Estonia , which provided a better political , constitutional and legal framework for the implementation of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
However , the international community had a part to play , not by pointing an accusing finger or engaging in a sterile debate , but by participating in a constructive dialogue in order to achieve positive , practical results .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
For the LDCs to reap the full potential benefit of the Uruguay Round Agreements , concrete and positive action should be directed at two broad areas : measures to overcome , or at least ameliorate , structural weaknesses of the LDCs in order to enhance their trade performance ; and effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements , and the expeditious implementation of the S &amp; amp ; D provisions and the Decisions on Measures in Favour of LDCs as well as consideration of further S &amp; amp ; D treatment .  
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
Although the sciences of biology and law seem far apart and unrelated , being regarded as two distinct cultures , in actual fact the concerns of law are closely interlinked with those of biology , particularly after the tremendous achievements made by biological science in the modification , removal and replacement of human genes and the positive or negative improvement of offspring .  
The concept of an international crime was deeply rooted in contemporary positive law , and the distinction between crimes and delicts was a qualitative one between ordinary wrongful acts and serious wrongful acts which damaged the fundamental interests of the international community .  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .  
It is our hope that 1997 will see the progressive diminution of the remaining tensions and suspicions , and the fostering of a spirit of constructive and positive cooperation between the different communities , from which can grow lasting stability and economic prosperity based on mutual respect , democracy and the rule of law .  
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
A new international dynamic combines three positive impulses : first , modernization and political and economic opening in most countries ; secondly , economic integration in regional contexts , with multiple political and security benefits ; and thirdly , the internationalization of the economy on a global scale .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
With this positive landscape in international relations and expectations , the United Nations embarked upon a series of unprecedented global conferences addressing key issues facing mankind , ranging from environment , human rights , population , social development , women and human settlements to food security . 
To this effect , the United Nations , in cooperation with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions should enhance the positive and address the negative impacts of structural adjustment programmes on economic and social development and assist adjusting countries in creating conditions for economic growth , employment opportunities , poverty eradication and social development while protecting basic social programmes and expenditures from budget reductions .  
National strategies of economic reform and international cooperation must incorporate strong concern for the social implications in order to enhance the positive and minimize the negative effects of the global economy .  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
Its programmes are geared towards providing Muslim children with information on Islamic culture and life , thus giving them the chance for a balanced understanding of their culture and the culture of the country in which they live , in order to enhance positive participation based on mutual understanding .  
Devising and disseminating such policies with detailed practical examples providing guidance to all those concerned , in the form of declarations , guides , codes of good practice , etc . , can make a positive contribution towards raising public awareness of different types of overt or covert discrimination , and thereby to their effective prevention .  
It has supported Palestinian women 's initiatives through an extensive network of institutions , including the work of the Women 's Center for Legal Aid and Counselling on gender sensitive amendments to legislation , the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Elections awareness-raising campaign for rural women , and the work of the Palestinian Coalition for Women 's Health . It has also encouraged activities that promote a positive representation of women in audio , visual and written media .  
The Special Representative accepts that incidents taken out of context can be misleading and indeed that the media - in any society - tend to give undue weight to the violent , to the outrageous , to the negative , to what they deem newsworthy , at the expense of the prosaic , the positive developments that are occurring in everyday life .  
Harnessing the positive potential of development and trade is also being developed in other key areas of the Convention , such as access to genetic resources ; intellectual property rights ; technology transfer ; and social and economic incentives .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
JUNIC agreed on the need to develop a joint message of the United Nations with global appeal , to be based on a critical analysis of both the positive and negative feedback from the recent coverage and public debate about the role and achievements of the Organization , and to consider a methodology of media outreach that would successfully counter the effects of the existing information overload .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
The United Nations to create an international legal basis for the process of redirecting nuclear missile potential to the objectives stipulated in Agenda 21 and to ensure the financing of an international expert analysis of the attendant positive and negative factors ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
For the first time in its history , a peaceful hand-over of power between two democratically elected presidents took place in February 1996 , when President Pr � al assumed office ; several election rounds have been held without violent incidents ; and the fledgling police force , which is making progress towards the day when it can alone assume public security functions , is already having a positive effect on security in the country : compared to 1995 , the average number of homicides committed monthly in 1997 has decreased .  
Such provocative actions by the separatist leaders of the Armenians in Nagorny Karabakh , at a time when positive trends are emerging towards a just and decisive resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the granting of broad autonomy to Nagorny Karabakh , once again demonstrate that the separatists , consolidating the results of the aggression committed against Azerbaijan , intend to nullify the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk group of OSCE and thereby to destroy the peacemaking process . 
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
The somewhat positive performance by the service sectors is based on growth in the financial sector and , to a lesser extent , in community and personal services , as the preliminary figures for the remaining service sectors show negative movement .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Thus , while the Government of the Republic of Angola regrets once again the fact that , in spite of the numerous General Assembly resolutions , among others , not one positive measure has been taken to lift the embargo , it urges the international community to cooperate with the United Nations in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to that blockade , whose main victims are thousands of human beings who are forced to make extraordinary sacrifices and see their social and economic development hindered .  
Allow me to reiterate here the great importance of the support of the international community in assisting the member States of the Standing Advisory Committee to carry out the positive measures they have adopted , in a context that must be described as particularly difficult , in order to strengthen subregional security through increased cooperation , as is reflected in document A / 52 / 283 , which contains the report of the ninth ministerial meeting of the Standing Advisory Committee , held in Libreville , Gabon , from 7 to 11 July 1997 .  
After prolonged and difficult talks , the protocol concerning the redeployment in Hebron , concluded on 17 January 1997 , inspired the hope that confidence and mutual trust between Palestinians and Israelis would increase and create a positive environment for subsequent negotiations that could be successful .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
The European Union wishes again to express its appreciation of the positive way in which the United Nations has contributed to the Guatemala peace process by supporting the parties and encouraging them to bring about a firm and lasting peace and to work towards national reconciliation , so that the foundations of democracy and development may be laid in a climate of justice and freedom .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
We believe that , for an environment conducive to progress in the peace process to be maintained , particularly at this difficult time , it is essential that the Palestinian people see and experience for themselves the positive economic and social effects of the political changes that would be brought about by a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and its neighbours .  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Lastly , with regard to the question of foreign debt , there is now broad agreement that without favourable treatment for the stock of African debt , particularly in the most heavily indebted countries , no economic recovery programme can produce the desired long-term positive effects .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
In spite of the major political changes around the world , characterized , inter alia , by the end of the cold war and the promising prospects for the settlement of several regional conflicts , and in spite of formidable advances in science and technology , the fact remains that the hopes raised by this dynamic have not had the positive results we had hoped for in the social sphere .  
It is regrettable that paragraph 125 selected only two situations and described them as negative , without putting them within the proper context to which we referred to earlier , and without balancing them against the positive and consistent record of Iraq 's cooperation with the Special Commission and all its efforts in the implementation of its mandate as defined by the Security Council . 
Institutional improvements under way deserve the political support of Member States so that current efforts at integrating the Organization 's analytical and normative functions in the economic and social spheres may help regional and national efforts to generate positive repercussions worldwide .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
There has been a rapid expansion in both formal and informal regional arrangements , driven in part by concerns over the potential negative impacts of globalization on national economies and by the positive prospects of regionalization .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
Real GDP has been growing at 2 to 6 per cent annual rate in all Eastern and Central European countries since 1994 ; the Baltic States have definitely reversed the trend of negative growth seen in the early 1990s and are steadily moving towards economic growth ; even in the former Soviet Union , where reforms were delayed in a number of countries , positive real GDP growth has been recorded in 1996.8 Nevertheless , pressing problems remain in the form of high unemployment and rising poverty . 
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As it relates to freedom of expression , the Kurdish question consists of a positive element _ cultural identity as an essential part of the universal human dignity protected by human rights _ and a negative element _ the political usurpation of this identity by those who seek to gain and retain power by all means , including terrorism .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
However , while macroeconomic stabilization was a necessary but not sufficient condition for enterprise development , structural adjustment and liberalization measures had produced encouraging positive results such as the emergence of an enterprise culture and increased entrepreneurial activities to take advantage of the enlarged economic opportunities for the private sector arising from such measures .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Turning to the operative part of the draft resolution , he said that , while paragraph 1 welcomed his Governments declared commitment to civilian rule , there was no mention of the positive steps which it had taken to fulfil that commitment , which included the establishment of a national electoral commission , the registration of voters and political parties and the delimitation of constituencies .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
The meeting expressed , inter alia , appreciation for the neutral and impartial way in which the multinational protection force , acting under Security Council resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , carries out its mandate and for the positive results so far achieved in guaranteeing the safe arrival of humanitarian aid .  
The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
The global plan of action , which sought to create the many new jobs required , especially in urban areas , specifically linked urban economic development to job creation and addressed the positive relationship between shelter and employment .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
Except for two years since Rio , Zambia has been unable to register positive growth in its gross domestic product , despite my Government \ x { e5b8 } very determined effort to put in place comprehensive reform measures in the private and public sectors .  
The presidential initiative of convening " open forums " , in which the Government , political parties and representatives of civil society will participate , to discuss urgent issues of national life , and the decision by the members of these forums to include the topic of privatization on their agenda , is therefore a positive development and fully consistent with the implementation strategy of the Timetable Agreement , which emphasizes effective participation of social sectors in establishing public policies concerning them .  
During the discussions particular attention was paid to the positive role of the media as an instrument for the protection and promotion of the rights of persons belonging to minorities , as well as to the negative role the media could play by exacerbating problems involving minorities and latent ethnic , religious or racial tensions .  
I will not recall here the scale of the guarantees already afforded by my country , whether they be positive or negative , in the latter case through the relevant protocols to treaties establishing nuclear _ weapon _ free zones which have all been ratified by France , which therefore cover more than 100 countries , but as far as the Conference on Disarmament is concerned , the question was more simply whether an ad hoc committee on security assurances with a mandate drawn up in 1992 was still the order of the day .  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
It considered that the existing arrangements for the composition of , and elections to , the bureau of the Committee had played a positive role , but also had negative aspects , including the failure to reflect the actual situation of international relations and the lack of equitable regional representation .  
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
Under such circumstances , the DPRK long ago put forward to the United States side a proposal that senior military officers of both sides sit down face to face to negotiate the establishment of a new mechanism in conformity with the actual situation in order to deter dangerous situations from arising , and has been waiting with patience for positive response .  
Peace needs to be considered , not as the absence of differences and conflicts , but as a positive , dynamic , participatory process linked intrinsically to democracy , justice and development for all by which differences are respected , dialogue is encouraged and conflicts are constantly transformed by non-violent means into new avenues of understanding and cooperation .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .  
But these bold reforms , whose positive macroeconomic results can already be measured , have rarely been accompanied by an improvement in the international environment and therefore have not allowed for a genuine economic take-off .  
In the view of the speakers , national and international responses are required to make globalization an overall positive development so that the quality of life both economic welfare and the enjoyment of cultural heritage of all people may be improved .  
The evaluations show that a major factor for achieving positive results is the availability of a critical mass of financial resources in order for the national programmes that the United Nations system is supporting to be effective .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
To the extent that globalization has enabled some countries to attract external investment leading to accelerated economic growth and thus an expanded revenue base , it has had a potentially positive impact on social provision .  
The Subcommittee recognized the positive impact of the IMF initiative towards the long-term goal of improving data quality ; in particular , the potential of GDDS to serve as a master plan for statistical development was mentioned .  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
It was projected that at the end of 1998 , combined cash would total $ 528-million , based on regular budget cash of negative $ 247-million and peacekeeping positive balances of $ 775-million .  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session in 1997 , urged Governments to consider the positive and negative impact of subsidies on the conservation and management of fisheries through national , regional and appropriate international organizations , and based on those analyses to consider appropriate action .  
We look forward to participating actively and constructively at the coming preparatory meeting for the 2000 Review Conference , which in our view should recoup the ground lost at previous meetings and resume the positive spirit and substantive role with which the strengthened review process started in 1995 .  
This relates to the complex question of international and national transfers to internalize positive externalities by supporting forest-based sustainable livelihoods of the rural poor .  
His country therefore welcomed the outcome of the intensive negotiations held in September and October 1998 and was convinced that the current draft convention represented a positive development with respect to the international communitys endeavours to prepare a universally accepted instrument to curb or eliminate the threat of nuclear terrorism .  There were , however , a number of issues that needed to be clarified and settled .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
The declared purpose of the Strategic Framework , namely to enhance the synergy between the political objective of building peace and international assistance activities , and promoting greater effectiveness and coherence of such activities requires a positive and flexible approach and enhancement of resources for humanitarian assistance , not a negative and rigid approach or the reduction of the resources committed to humanitarian assistance .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
The major objective of the subprogramme is to promote an informed and positive public understanding of the activities of the United Nations and help build broad-based global support for the Organizations goals by highlighting the priority issues of concern to the international community .  
Reiterates its invitation to States to promote a culture of peace based on the purposes and principles established in the Charter of the United Nations , respect for all human rights , democracy , education for peace , promotion of sustainable development , tolerance , respect for pluralism , positive acceptance of multiculturalism , the wider participation of women , and equal opportunities for all , as an integral approach to preventing violence in its diverse manifestations ;  
Reiterates its invitation to States to promote a culture of peace based on the purposes and principles established in the Charter of the United Nations , respect for all human rights , democracy , education for peace , promotion of sustainable development , tolerance , respect for pluralism , positive acceptance of multiculturalism , the wider participation of women , and equal opportunities for all , as an integral approach to preventing violence in its diverse manifestations ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
EU considers these positive developments as a solid basis for a stable process of change of Indonesia 's political , economic and social system leading to a civic society based on democratic principles , the rule of law and internationally accepted human rights standards .  
Without prejudging such issues nor the underlying political motivations , the Special Rapporteur believes that the Bill of Rights enshrined in the new Constitution should nevertheless be interpreted as a positive step , provided that it is accompanied by energetic legal and political measures , ensuring that the transition from a de facto emergency regime to a more open and democratic system based on the rule of law .  
A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
This is a notion that has been deeply ingrained in the conceptual development , positive normativity and consistent jurisprudence of both municipal and international law since Roman Law was at its zenith more than five centuries ago , when modern European colonization began .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
We recognize , however , that more preventative health and family life education and counselling programmes relevant to the needs of our youth are required to abate the spate of adolescent pregnancy so that the youth of our nation can make positive , responsible choices about sexual activity and be productive , contributing members of society .  
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Nevertheless , determined as I believe we should be to go ahead , undeterred by the intimidation , and in view of the need to adhere to the shortest possible time-frame , I have decided to begin the registration , based on positive assurances by the Indonesian authorities , on the condition that meaningful , visible improvements in the security situation will be observed in the immediate future .  
That the historical piecemeal approach to natural disasters needed to be replaced with an integrated approach one that would cut across natural hazards and would include planning , preparedness , prevention , warnings , relief and rehabilitation , and that a broader appreciation of the positive relationship between disaster reduction and economic and social development goals was required .  
The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
The economic , social and cultural rights , on the other hand , required to be protected through positive action over time , which would consume resources , and since resources were always limited , the realization of these rights would naturally be constrained .  
Despite positive developments linked to the creation of the PA and removal of restrictions from the occupation period , economic activities were adversely affected and the interim period has been characterized by prolonged decline in the standard of living , with high and fluctuating unemployment .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
Except for Angola , Burundi , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Haiti , Rwanda and Sierra Leone , all of the least developed countries for which data are available recorded , on average , positive growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the period 19901997 , although there were wide variations in country performance in annual growth rates over the period .  
Although the review made many positive comments about the quality of evaluation work at the central level , particularly its low cost and high output relative to its limited staff , the review was nonetheless critical of UNHCRs commitment to the function .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
By the same token , access to global markets that are expanding at a steady , sustained rate is crucial in allowing countries confronting external payment difficulties to undertake positive adjustment in the context of economic expansion rather than contraction .  
The positive effects of air transport on the immediate living conditions of the very poor can readily be seen in the emergency distribution of essential foods , medicines and other commodities , and in the transport of health and social workers to remote locations where traditional means of transport are often impractical or impossible .  
We are sure that , given your skilful and widely recognized abilities and leadership , our deliberations will reach a positive conclusion that will be highly beneficial to the international community , and particularly to the nations deprived of free and sovereign access to the sea .  
Poland expressed the view that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States constitutes a positive step towards the implementation of the provisions of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
The debate in the Security Council today reflects the keen interest of the international community in continuing its efforts to effect positive change in Africa by settling or containing the current regional and civil conflicts and meeting the humanitarian and development needs of its peoples and States .  
C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
Despite the scope of the challenges facing countries as a result of globalization , he was confident that the phenomenon was a vehicle for positive changes of benefit to humankind as a whole , since they fostered democratic systems of government that respected human dignity and encouraged countries to be responsible members of a more peaceful international community .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
Despite the positive developments connected with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority , economic activities had been adversely affected by a prolonged fall in living conditions , high unemployment and border closures , which led to an internal geographic separation of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
He looked forward to a positive outcome of the meetings currently being held in Oslo among the leaders of the relevant parties and emphasized that the international community had a collective responsibility to support the parties concerned and to promote the Middle East peace process .  
Mr . Obou ( Cte dIvoire ) said that the question of nationality was complex because it arose at the interface between international law and positive national law , yet it was vital to the identity of any individual , since to be stateless was to be dead to civic life .

While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day .
