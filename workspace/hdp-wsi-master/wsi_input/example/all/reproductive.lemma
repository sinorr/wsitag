Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
The Bill provides for the membership of the Council to be drawn from a wide cross-section of the community , including medical practitioners , social workers , lawyers and persons who are associated with religion .  This is to enable the Council to consider wholly the medical , social , moral , ethical and legal issues arising from reproductive technology .  
A spokesman for the PCRT said that the task of the PCRT is to advise on the regulatory framework for reproductive technology ( RT ) through a licensing system by a statutory council , to draw up a code of practice for compliance by licensed RT centres , to examine new developments in RT that are not covered by the former Committee on Scientifically Assisted Human Reproduction and to re-examine RT practices in view of changing societal norms , values and overseas trends .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
Currently sex education classes-covering things like reproductive biology , sexual values , and the use of sanitary napkins and condoms-are being taught in middle and primary schools across Taiwan . Through education at the roots , children can be helped to keep themselves steady through this period of vast change , and build a sexual value system suited to the 21st century .  
Yet these flowers go quite unnoticed , for the whole of the plants ' reproductive process , from flowering to pollination to fruiting , takes place hidden inside the hollow , fleshy fruiting bodies that develop into figs .  
But this rare catch of a pregnant shark also confirmed how late whale sharks mature , and showed that in their reproductive strategy they prefer " quality " over " quantity . " In today 's age of unbridled exploitation of ocean fisheries , this does not bode well for the survival of whale shark populations .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
She noted that the strategy concentrated on improving women 's reproductive health , with a major emphasis on reducing abortion and unwanted and adolescent pregnancy and on increasing contraceptive prevalence .  
The study reviewed recent trends in women 's educational status in developing countries and updated existing evidence on the direct and indirect linkages between education and reproductive behaviour , marriage and desired family size .  
It stressed the urgent need for the expansion of reproductive choice by developing new and improved methods of fertility regulation that were safe , effective and responsive to the needs and concerns of the users , including adolescents .  
UNCED further emphasized that gross chemical contamination , with grave damage to human health , genetic structures , reproductive outcomes , and the environment , continues to exist in some of the world 's most important industrial areas .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , was not yet sufficiently understood .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , is not yet sufficiently understood .  
Urges the High Commissioner to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training , legal awareness and education , and in particular in the area of reproductive health , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees , in conformity with universally recognized international human rights and the UNHCR Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women ;  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities , which include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values , taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities that include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values and taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .  
Research to assess the comparative social , environmental and financial costs and benefits of different technologies for basic and reproductive health care within a framework of universal safety and ethical considerations ;  
UNFPA regards family planning as a central component of reproductive health care : it allows couples and individuals to meet their reproductive goals ; is essential in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity ; is indispensable in reducing the incidence of abortion ; and contributes to efforts to prevent the transmission of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
Such services must be adapted to specific socio-cultural contexts ; be extended to poor women , minorities , unmarried women and adolescents ; promote healthy and responsible reproductive behaviour ; pay special attention to young adults and men ; and promote the use of condoms and other barrier methods of contraception .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Strengthen vital statistical systems and incorporate gender analysis into publications and research ; give priority to gender differences in research design and in data collection and analysis in order to improve data on morbidity ; and improve data collection on access to health services , [ including access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services , maternal care and family planning , with special priority for adolescent mothers and care of the elderly ] ;  
Strengthen vital statistical systems and incorporate gender analysis into publications and research ; give priority to gender differences in research design and in data collection and analysis in order to improve data on morbidity ; and improve data collection on access to health services [ including access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services , maternal care and family planning , with special priority for adolescent mothers and for elder care ] ;  
Strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes including sexual and reproductive health and design quality health programmes to meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young , expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
Provide more accessible , available and affordable primary health-care services of high quality , including sexual and reproductive health care , which includes family planning information and services , and giving particular attention to maternal and emergency obstetric care , as agreed in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
Any new concept needs to be accompanied by an information , education and communication ( IEC ) strategy to make people aware of its content and implications - all the more so if this new concept involves , as does the concept of reproductive rights and reproductive health , many aspects , ranging from sociocultural factors - cultural beliefs and practices , status of women , overall health and well-being , religious convictions and ethical values - to economic conditions .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
One key objective of advocacy is to create a supportive and enabling cultural , social and political environment for reproductive health .  
The international community has already defined a number of indicators relevant to reproductive health , and WHO is working on additional qualitative and quantitative indicators for global monitoring ;  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
Those acting at the international level have long been recognized for their contributing role in advocating for reproductive rights and reproductive health and for providing assistance to national Governments and national non-governmental organizations in technical aspects of population , family planning and reproductive health programmes .  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
Undertake research that is specific to women in a number of health areas , for example reproductive health ( including contraceptive research and development ) , as well as research on substance abuse , occupational health , environmental health , adolescent health , tuberculosis and tropical diseases , including any gender-specific determinants , disease patterns and consequences , with a view to making recommendations on health policy and programme improvements designed to ensure optimal health for men and women ( WHO , UNDCP ) .  
Provide assistance to Governments in support of poverty-alleviation efforts designed to improve the economic status of women , in the framework of national policy and legislation and focusing on productive employment generation and poverty alleviation , working conditions and social protection , skill training schemes , especially with respect to managerial , supervisory and high-level positions , and income-generating activities ; introduce reproductive health and other population components into existing income-generation activities ( ILO , UNFPA , UN / DDSMS ) .  
Promoting cooperation among government agencies , health-care workers , non-governmental organizations , women 's organizations and other institutions of civil society in order to develop a comprehensive national strategy for improving reproductive health care and child health-care services and ensuring that people living in poverty have full access to those services , including , inter alia , education and services on family planning , safe motherhood and prenatal and postnatal care , and the benefits of breast-feeding , consistent with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
Endorses the establishment of a global contraceptive commodity programme , to be managed by the United Nations Population Fund , and funded with an initial capitalization of $ 5 million , as set out in paragraph 23 of document DP / FPA / 1996 / 3 , as an integral component of the overall work of the Fund in strengthening reproductive health programmes , including family planning and sexual health , and emphasizes that these activities should be monitored carefully to ensure that they adhere to technical standards of safety and quality ;  
A number of the issues raised in the report deserved to be highlighted , including the need to put a stop to the use of children as soldiers , the introduction of a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines , and the need in conflict situations to provide humanitarian guarantees for the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and steps to protect women and children from rape and other forms of sexual violence .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Moreover , the Programme of Action is committed to improving the quality of life by focusing on three interdependent goals : reductions in infant , child and maternal mortality ; expanded access to education , particularly for women and girls ; and universal access to primary health care , including reproductive health and family planning services .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
The analysis has identified key characteristics determining MMR achievements such as : ( a ) the level of development in health infrastructure , particularly regarding access to and use of maternal health services ; ( b ) the overall reproductive health and nutritional status of women ; ( c ) educational achievement , women 's age at first delivery , number of deliveries , proportion of unsafe and illegal abortions , and violence against women ; and ( d ) the countrys stage of overall socio-economic development .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
Under a successor project , " Sexual behaviour and reproductive health and fertility regulation " , the ECE secretariat is currently completing the archiving of the standardized Fertility and Family Survey data files along with the work of standard tabulations , which will ensure that the data are internationally comparable , of high quality and easily accessible to researchers .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Maternal health has been a growing focus for UNICEF , with key interventions directed at the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality , including improvements in perinatal care , maternal nutrition and access to expanded reproductive health care .  
UNFPA is the lead agency for integration of reproductive health care , which includes sexual health and family planning , maternal and neonatal care , prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and elimination of harmful practices , including female genital mutilation ( FGM ) and violence against women .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women and specifically address the special needs of girls and women as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents , rural and urban poor , persons in remote or neglected areas , and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
In the area of reproductive health and family planning , the Population Division of ESCAP has initiated a regional project to strengthen monitoring and information systems to provide accurate and timely indicators and has been assisting Governments in developing and strengthening policies for involving the elderly in social and economic development .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
UNICEF is also engaged in integrated programmes in regions where maternal mortality rates decreased over the past years but where there is a high prevalence of other reproductive health problems such as sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted adolescent pregnancies , cervical cancers and gender violence .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
The first involves persistent organic pollutants that bioaccumulate , possibly causing cancer , reproductive disorders , damage to central and peripheral nervous systems and diseases of the immune system , and interfering with infant and child development .  
The meeting had been devoted to three themes : the creation of a favourable environment for the emancipation of teenage girls ; the special need for social protection of adolescent girls ; and teenage health , including sexual and reproductive health .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
The falling birth rate is attributable to the sharp deterioration in society 's social and economic situation which , by reducing the level of family welfare , has adverse effects on reproductive behaviour .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
To make information and counselling widely available to adolescent girls and boys , especially on human relationships , reproductive and sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases and adolescent pregnancy , in a manner that is confidential and easily accessible , and to emphasize the equal responsibility of girls and boys ;  
In the national programme on improving the status of women , specific objectives were put forward under the strategic thrust of bettering the scope and quality of reproductive health services , which include the following : to offer once every two years to all women preventive medical check-ups ; to make them healthier ; and to activate health advocacy , training , publicity , information dissemination and counselling for the general public .  
The agreed conclusions of the meeting reaffirmed , inter alia , that universal access to quality , comprehensive and affordable health care , including reproductive and sexual health of women throughout the life cycle , are essential requirements for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Three studies on population and development , on migration and urbanization and on adolescent reproductive health ; a manual for creating population directory databases ; a country profile on plant nutrient sector development ( annual ) ; strengthening income-generating opportunities for rural women in selected Central Asian republics ; rural employment promotion ; and overview of housing rights in Asia and the Pacific ; ( iii ) Electronic , audio and video issuances .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
The evaluation highlights the advantages of the reproductive health approach in HIV / AIDS prevention and identifies among its key recommendations the need to strengthen technical capacity at the country level to promote a focused , appropriate and efficient response to the epidemic ; to make condom provision even more central to HIV / AIDS strategies ; and to strengthen further activities for young people .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family-planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree on common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree on common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .  
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
What began as a modest capacity-building exercise in delivering birth-spacing services in selected parts of the country has expanded into a full nationwide reproductive health programme which is a fully integrated part of the standard minimum package of activities for primary health-care services .  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .  
The programme , which does away with any mutilation , encourages girls ready to assume their adult responsibilities to seclude themselves for a week during which they receive parts of the traditional education on their future roles as women plus more modern material on health , reproductive problems , effective means of communication , self _ respect and esteem and how to deal with problems they may encounter in their lives as women . 
At the service delivery level , UNFPA assisted in the establishment of a womens centre for reproductive health care , social assistance , legal and psychological counselling and community education at Burej refugee camp , Gaza , which served some 13,000 refugee women in 1998 and is supporting the establishment of a similar centre in the Jabalia refugee camp , Gaza .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
The special sessions strong reinforcement of human rights and the human well-being language of the Programme of Action was particularly welcome , as were the calls for intensified action in implementing the Programme of Action , and the new benchmarks in reproductive and sexual health , access to family planning services , reduced maternal mortality , HIV / AIDS prevention , gender issues and education . 
The same perspective was defended during the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the April 1995 preparatory seminar that constituted a debating forum on the situation of women : the realization of their civic and political rights ; their economic , social and cultural rights ; their reproductive rights and so-called new rights , inter alia , the right to development and quality of life .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
Not only have we had to battle against established customs and the preachings of a number of conservative sectors , we also although this may be difficult to believe have had to deal with a number of non-governmental organizations which , when they did not get the budgetary support they expected , joined the campaign being waged by some parts of the media and certain political sectors and , betraying their principles , acted in opposition to the reproductive health programmes .  
At the same time , they channel the consciousness of governmental organizations and civil society in order to secure innovative , concerted , intersectorial and multisectorial actions designed to permit a satisfactory sexual and reproductive life at the individual , family and social levels in a climate of equity which promotes healthy and whole lifestyles .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
At home and on the international stage , New Zealand has sought to play an active role in the promotion of the human rights of women and to ensure their full participation in society as equal partners with men , in particular supporting and encouraging sexual and reproductive health rights and other rights of women , which are central to the Programme of Action .  
I must stress again the need for an increase in international assistance , which we , as a developing country , need if we are to reduce the death rate from the HIV AIDS pandemic , from infectious or parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera , and most of all to meet the needs of young men and women for reproductive and sexual health . 
Securing the right to safe motherhood is also emphasized , along with infertility services and comprehensive care for adolescents in order to promote and develop appropriate sexual and reproductive health and the prevention of cervical , uterine and breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men , while continuing with the national plan for prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV AIDS .  
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Swaziland is in the process of developing a national population policy and a comprehensive reproductive health programme with the participation of representatives of religious leaders , traditional and community leaders , non-governmental organizations , academic institutions , youth and other special groups as well as experts , policy makers and planners .  
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
Promoting healthy and responsible behaviour in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health requires profound cultural change , and the Government therefore considers it important to incorporate population issues into curricula at all levels of the national education system .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
Various workshops and round tables on reproductive health rights and a technical symposium on international migration and development which had called special attention to female migrant workers had been held in the context of the five-year review of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development .  
Short _ term complications can include severe pain and haemorrhage that can lead to shock or even death , while long-term complications can include urine retention , resulting in repeated urinary infections ; obstruction of menstrual flow , leading to frequent reproductive tract infections and infertility ; and prolonged and obstructed labour . 21 Furthermore , FGM can result in psychological problems such as chronic anxiety and depression . 
Nearly 20 , 000 Indian women die every year due to unsafe abortions . 36 Attempts to induce abortion through the use of herbs or roots through the vaginal route , the injection of acid-like fluids into the womb , the use of caustic soda , arsenic and double doses of contraceptive pills , and the insertion of surgical probes , plant stems , wires and toothpicks have harmful reproductive health consequences and may fail to result in successful abortions . 
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .

Governments are also encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer disproportionately from reproductive ill health .  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .

Female genital mutilation had been banned in many African countries ; policy-makers and healthcare providers in many countries were paying more attention to adolescent reproductive health ; access to health services was being improved for poor rural women and efforts were being made to address the particular vulnerability of women and girl children to the HIV / AIDS epidemic .  
In October 2000 , the Task Force completed new and / or revised Guidelines for the United Nations Resident Coordinator System in the following areas : adolescent sexual and reproductive health ; basic education with special attention to gender disparities ; maternal mortality reduction ; reproductive health ; and HIV / AIDS . UNFPA is actively involved in the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General , and through the UNDG actively contributed to the preparation of the action strategies on halving extreme poverty and girls education . 
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
Services cover maternal care / reproductive health , child health , curative care , dental health , health education / promotion , control of communicable diseases , prevention and control of non-communicable chronic diseases through the promotion of healthy lifestyles , and environmental health services .

Within the framework of the memorandum of understanding between ECO and the United Nations Population Fund , five joint activities have taken place , the last being a conference held at Istanbul in May 2000 on expanding contraceptive choice and improving quality of reproductive health programmes .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
The principle of voluntary and informed choice in respect of the provision of sexual and reproductive health services should be recognized as a basic human right .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
The Bill provides for the membership of the Council to be drawn from a wide cross-section of the community , including medical practitioners , social workers , lawyers and persons who are associated with religion .  This is to enable the Council to consider wholly the medical , social , moral , ethical and legal issues arising from reproductive technology .  
A spokesman for the PCRT said that the task of the PCRT is to advise on the regulatory framework for reproductive technology ( RT ) through a licensing system by a statutory council , to draw up a code of practice for compliance by licensed RT centres , to examine new developments in RT that are not covered by the former Committee on Scientifically Assisted Human Reproduction and to re-examine RT practices in view of changing societal norms , values and overseas trends .  
Moreover , with social liberalizations , sexual relationships have become more complex . With increased work pressure and the ill effects of environmental pollution , the reproductive systems of both men and women have sustained direct damage .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
Back in the 1970s , when women in the US and Europe began fighting for " reproductive autonomy , " the socially and politically influential Catholic Church entered the debate right at the start . The Church positioned itself as speaking " for the rights of the unborn child , " providing an organized anti-abortion force . This brought abortion into the realm of public debate , and the " right to choose " became a political issue .  
In one media report , a doctor was quoted as saying : " It has been discovered that if women who have been single for a long time have introverted personalities , and are self-absorbed , their emotional life often becomes very bizarre . As they repress their sexual desires , their hormone secretions fall out of balance , and they are susceptible to tumors in the reproductive system .  
Currently sex education classes-covering things like reproductive biology , sexual values , and the use of sanitary napkins and condoms-are being taught in middle and primary schools across Taiwan . Through education at the roots , children can be helped to keep themselves steady through this period of vast change , and build a sexual value system suited to the 21st century .  
Yet these flowers go quite unnoticed , for the whole of the plants ' reproductive process , from flowering to pollination to fruiting , takes place hidden inside the hollow , fleshy fruiting bodies that develop into figs .  
But this rare catch of a pregnant shark also confirmed how late whale sharks mature , and showed that in their reproductive strategy they prefer " quality " over " quantity . " In today 's age of unbridled exploitation of ocean fisheries , this does not bode well for the survival of whale shark populations .  
" It takes miniscule amounts of environmental hormones to cause harm , and there are no obvious side-effects in the short term . More research is still needed to confirm the connection with human reproductive disorders . As a result , people are apt to treat this issue lightly . " Wang Cheng-hsung worries that while guarding against more obvious risks , people will be complacent about these subtler dangers .  
She noted that the strategy concentrated on improving women 's reproductive health , with a major emphasis on reducing abortion and unwanted and adolescent pregnancy and on increasing contraceptive prevalence .  
The study reviewed recent trends in women 's educational status in developing countries and updated existing evidence on the direct and indirect linkages between education and reproductive behaviour , marriage and desired family size .  
It stressed the urgent need for the expansion of reproductive choice by developing new and improved methods of fertility regulation that were safe , effective and responsive to the needs and concerns of the users , including adolescents .  
UNCED further emphasized that gross chemical contamination , with grave damage to human health , genetic structures , reproductive outcomes , and the environment , continues to exist in some of the world 's most important industrial areas .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , was not yet sufficiently understood .  
The impact on human health , especially of longterm exposure to low doses of synthetic chemicals with potential neurotoxic , reproductive or immunotoxic effects , and their synergistic effects on nature , is not yet sufficiently understood .  
Urges the High Commissioner to undertake initiatives for refugee women in the areas of leadership and skills training , legal awareness and education , and in particular in the area of reproductive health , with full respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds of the refugees , in conformity with universally recognized international human rights and the UNHCR Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women ;  
The delegation of Egypt would like to avail itself of this opportunity to stress that whatever the linguistic formulas may be , its concept of the operative content of the paragraphs relating to reproductive and sexual health , especially paragraphs 56 , 57 and 58 , is that their implementation will take place in accordance with the legal system and the cultural and religious heritage of each society .  
So I ask Member States , when they hear us speaking out about the perils of radiation , to think about these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize Marshallese children being born faceless , with no bones , or with missing or extra limbs the jellyfish babies , as some have come to call them and the irreparable damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their mothers .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities , which include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values , taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .  
Awareness should be increased of the fundamental linkages between improving the status of women and demographic dynamics , particularly through women 's access to education , primary and reproductive health care programmes , economic independence and their effective , equitable participation in all levels of decision-making .  
Governments should take active steps to implement programmes to establish and strengthen preventive and curative health facilities that include women-centred , women-managed , safe and effective reproductive health care and affordable , accessible services , as appropriate , for the responsible planning of family size , in keeping with freedom , dignity and personally held values and taking into account ethical and cultural considerations .  
Research to assess the comparative social , environmental and financial costs and benefits of different technologies for basic and reproductive health care within a framework of universal safety and ethical considerations ;  
UNFPA regards family planning as a central component of reproductive health care : it allows couples and individuals to meet their reproductive goals ; is essential in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity ; is indispensable in reducing the incidence of abortion ; and contributes to efforts to prevent the transmission of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .  
Such services must be adapted to specific socio-cultural contexts ; be extended to poor women , minorities , unmarried women and adolescents ; promote healthy and responsible reproductive behaviour ; pay special attention to young adults and men ; and promote the use of condoms and other barrier methods of contraception .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Strengthen vital statistical systems and incorporate gender analysis into publications and research ; give priority to gender differences in research design and in data collection and analysis in order to improve data on morbidity ; and improve data collection on access to health services , [ including access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services , maternal care and family planning , with special priority for adolescent mothers and care of the elderly ] ;  
Strengthen vital statistical systems and incorporate gender analysis into publications and research ; give priority to gender differences in research design and in data collection and analysis in order to improve data on morbidity ; and improve data collection on access to health services [ including access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services , maternal care and family planning , with special priority for adolescent mothers and for elder care ] ;  
Strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes including sexual and reproductive health and design quality health programmes to meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young , expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Reproductive health eludes many of the world 's people because of such factors as : inadequate levels of knowledge about human sexuality and inappropriate or poor-quality reproductive health information and services ; the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviour ; discriminatory social practices ; negative attitudes towards women and girls ; and the limited power many women and girls have over their sexual and reproductive lives .  
Provide more accessible , available and affordable primary health-care services of high quality , including sexual and reproductive health care , which includes family planning information and services , and giving particular attention to maternal and emergency obstetric care , as agreed in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
Increase budgetary allocations for primary health care and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the reproductive and sexual health of girls and women ; priority should be given to health programmes in rural and poor urban areas ;  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
Any new concept needs to be accompanied by an information , education and communication ( IEC ) strategy to make people aware of its content and implications - all the more so if this new concept involves , as does the concept of reproductive rights and reproductive health , many aspects , ranging from sociocultural factors - cultural beliefs and practices , status of women , overall health and well-being , religious convictions and ethical values - to economic conditions .  
The limited coverage of health facilities , particularly in rural areas , poor referral or inadequate service delivery systems and the lack of human resources play further major roles in terms of limited access to reproductive health services and the quality of care provided in those facilities .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women , and ensure that they specifically address the special needs of girls and women , as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents ; the rural and urban poor ; persons in remote or neglected areas ; and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
One key objective of advocacy is to create a supportive and enabling cultural , social and political environment for reproductive health .  
The international community has already defined a number of indicators relevant to reproductive health , and WHO is working on additional qualitative and quantitative indicators for global monitoring ;  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The human rights approach to women 's health implied that international and national policies must be based on recognition of women 's rights , including the right to reproductive and sexual health and family planning , and demanded full commitment to the removal of economic , social and legal disadvantages that denied women their right to health .  
Those acting at the international level have long been recognized for their contributing role in advocating for reproductive rights and reproductive health and for providing assistance to national Governments and national non-governmental organizations in technical aspects of population , family planning and reproductive health programmes .  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
Undertake research that is specific to women in a number of health areas , for example reproductive health ( including contraceptive research and development ) , as well as research on substance abuse , occupational health , environmental health , adolescent health , tuberculosis and tropical diseases , including any gender-specific determinants , disease patterns and consequences , with a view to making recommendations on health policy and programme improvements designed to ensure optimal health for men and women ( WHO , UNDCP ) .  
Provide assistance to Governments in support of poverty-alleviation efforts designed to improve the economic status of women , in the framework of national policy and legislation and focusing on productive employment generation and poverty alleviation , working conditions and social protection , skill training schemes , especially with respect to managerial , supervisory and high-level positions , and income-generating activities ; introduce reproductive health and other population components into existing income-generation activities ( ILO , UNFPA , UN / DDSMS ) .  
Promoting cooperation among government agencies , health-care workers , non-governmental organizations , women 's organizations and other institutions of civil society in order to develop a comprehensive national strategy for improving reproductive health care and child health-care services and ensuring that people living in poverty have full access to those services , including , inter alia , education and services on family planning , safe motherhood and prenatal and postnatal care , and the benefits of breast-feeding , consistent with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
Endorses the establishment of a global contraceptive commodity programme , to be managed by the United Nations Population Fund , and funded with an initial capitalization of $ 5 million , as set out in paragraph 23 of document DP / FPA / 1996 / 3 , as an integral component of the overall work of the Fund in strengthening reproductive health programmes , including family planning and sexual health , and emphasizes that these activities should be monitored carefully to ensure that they adhere to technical standards of safety and quality ;  
A number of the issues raised in the report deserved to be highlighted , including the need to put a stop to the use of children as soldiers , the introduction of a comprehensive international ban on anti-personnel landmines , and the need in conflict situations to provide humanitarian guarantees for the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and steps to protect women and children from rape and other forms of sexual violence .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Moreover , the Programme of Action is committed to improving the quality of life by focusing on three interdependent goals : reductions in infant , child and maternal mortality ; expanded access to education , particularly for women and girls ; and universal access to primary health care , including reproductive health and family planning services .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
The analysis has identified key characteristics determining MMR achievements such as : ( a ) the level of development in health infrastructure , particularly regarding access to and use of maternal health services ; ( b ) the overall reproductive health and nutritional status of women ; ( c ) educational achievement , women 's age at first delivery , number of deliveries , proportion of unsafe and illegal abortions , and violence against women ; and ( d ) the countrys stage of overall socio-economic development .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
Under a successor project , " Sexual behaviour and reproductive health and fertility regulation " , the ECE secretariat is currently completing the archiving of the standardized Fertility and Family Survey data files along with the work of standard tabulations , which will ensure that the data are internationally comparable , of high quality and easily accessible to researchers .  
Where women have demonstrated a clear preference for those parties and candidates that are gender-sensitive and supportive of women 's interests , especially with regard to reproductive rights , social services , participation in decision-making , elimination of violence against women and environmental protection , close parliamentary or presidential contests have been influenced or the outcome determined by the female voters and their preferences .  
What is required fundamentally is a different perspective that integrates the micro and macro , bridges the public and private domains ( especially the productive and reproductive spheres ) and empowers different sectors of society , including both women and men to be effective in environmental decision-making .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Governments have moved to accord high priority to child survival and health ; the work of non-governmental organizations and of the private sector has expanded ; community participation has increased , and families have been empowered by gaining greater knowledge and skills about utilizing low-cost , easily available life-saving technologies for their children ; bilateral and multilateral agencies have mobilized greater resources for child survival and health interventions ; and immunization , nutrition and reproductive health programmes have expanded .  
Maternal health has been a growing focus for UNICEF , with key interventions directed at the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality , including improvements in perinatal care , maternal nutrition and access to expanded reproductive health care .  
UNFPA is the lead agency for integration of reproductive health care , which includes sexual health and family planning , maternal and neonatal care , prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections , sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and elimination of harmful practices , including female genital mutilation ( FGM ) and violence against women .  
It is critical that reproductive health programmes emphasize the empowerment of women and specifically address the special needs of girls and women as well as those of other underserved groups , such as youth and adolescents , rural and urban poor , persons in remote or neglected areas , and migrants , refugees and displaced persons .  
In the area of reproductive health and family planning , the Population Division of ESCAP has initiated a regional project to strengthen monitoring and information systems to provide accurate and timely indicators and has been assisting Governments in developing and strengthening policies for involving the elderly in social and economic development .  
Furthermore , under the special General Initiative Fund for Refugee Women , project support is being provided for the training of 100 traditional birth attendants in seven districts of Afghanistan ; for improving the reproductive health of refugee women in Malawi , which includes family planning advisory services , education on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS prevention and the addressing of cultural constraints and male attitudes to reproductive health care ; and for an educational video on female genital mutilation in Eritrea and related reproductive health care .  
UNICEF is also engaged in integrated programmes in regions where maternal mortality rates decreased over the past years but where there is a high prevalence of other reproductive health problems such as sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted adolescent pregnancies , cervical cancers and gender violence .  
In that declaration , an appeal was made to all family-planning associations and their allies , calling on them to identify problems requiring direct action at national level and asking them to make their respective societies aware of the ills of harmful traditional practices that run counter to the most elementary of sexual and reproductive rights .  
The participants agreed that , taken overall , these conferences and the Convention provided a basis on which to build not only the right of women to health but also the enjoyment of good health as a human right and that they exposed the extent of the poverty and economic dependence of women , the limited power exercised by many women over their sexual and reproductive life and their lack of influence over decisions , all of which social factors have a negative effect on their health .  
The first involves persistent organic pollutants that bioaccumulate , possibly causing cancer , reproductive disorders , damage to central and peripheral nervous systems and diseases of the immune system , and interfering with infant and child development .  
The meeting had been devoted to three themes : the creation of a favourable environment for the emancipation of teenage girls ; the special need for social protection of adolescent girls ; and teenage health , including sexual and reproductive health .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
The falling birth rate is attributable to the sharp deterioration in society 's social and economic situation which , by reducing the level of family welfare , has adverse effects on reproductive behaviour .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
To make information and counselling widely available to adolescent girls and boys , especially on human relationships , reproductive and sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases and adolescent pregnancy , in a manner that is confidential and easily accessible , and to emphasize the equal responsibility of girls and boys ;  
In the national programme on improving the status of women , specific objectives were put forward under the strategic thrust of bettering the scope and quality of reproductive health services , which include the following : to offer once every two years to all women preventive medical check-ups ; to make them healthier ; and to activate health advocacy , training , publicity , information dissemination and counselling for the general public .  
The agreed conclusions of the meeting reaffirmed , inter alia , that universal access to quality , comprehensive and affordable health care , including reproductive and sexual health of women throughout the life cycle , are essential requirements for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action .  
Three studies on population and development , on migration and urbanization and on adolescent reproductive health ; a manual for creating population directory databases ; a country profile on plant nutrient sector development ( annual ) ; strengthening income-generating opportunities for rural women in selected Central Asian republics ; rural employment promotion ; and overview of housing rights in Asia and the Pacific ; ( iii ) Electronic , audio and video issuances .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
The evaluation highlights the advantages of the reproductive health approach in HIV / AIDS prevention and identifies among its key recommendations the need to strengthen technical capacity at the country level to promote a focused , appropriate and efficient response to the epidemic ; to make condom provision even more central to HIV / AIDS strategies ; and to strengthen further activities for young people .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family-planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family-planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree on common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
A broad set of actions is also being developed to ensure universal access to an increasingly broad range of integrated and high-quality reproductive health services , which are offered with full respect for the dignity of individuals and couples and the right to free choice .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;  
Governments should strive to ensure that by 2015 all primary health-care and family planning facilities are able to provide , directly or through referral , the widest achievable range of safe and effective family planning and contraceptive methods ; essential obstetric care ; prevention and management of reproductive tract infections , including sexually transmitted diseases , and barrier methods ( such as male and female condoms and microbicides if available ) to prevent infection .  
Increased efforts are needed by the United Nations system , with support from the international community , to develop and agree on common key indicators on reproductive health programmes , including , inter alia , family planning , maternal health , sexual health , sexually transmitted diseases , HIV / AIDS , and information , education and communication for appropriate consideration in the relevant intergovernmental process .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Acknowledge and promote the central role of families , parents and other legal guardians in educating their children and shaping their attitudes , and ensure that parents and persons with legal responsibilities are educated about and involved in providing sexual and reproductive health information , in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of adolescents , so that they can fulfil their rights and responsibilities towards adolescents ;  
Governments are further encouraged to recognize and support the important and complementary role that civil society at the national level can play in helping communities to articulate and meet their needs for health care , including reproductive health care .  
The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
Governments of recipient countries are encouraged to ensure that public resources , subsidies and assistance received from international donors for the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action are invested to maximize benefits to the poor and other vulnerable population groups , including those who suffer from disproportionate reproductive ill health .  
Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .  
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
Within the framework of respect for human rights and strengthening democracy , the Bolivian State intends to continue seeking alternative models for dealing with sexual and reproductive health within the context of the social , economic , political and cultural factors that come into play in health matters .  
Other women-based policies since put in place deal with the elimination of female genital mutilation ; adolescent health ; legal reforms to eliminate domestic violence and to raise the minimum age for marriage to 18 years ; and the development of a strategic framework for the implementation of adolescent reproductive health , among others .  
Our main objectives are to eradicate absolute poverty , increase access to basic education for girls , eliminate gender disparities , increase access to reproductive health care , and reduce cultural and legal barriers that discriminate against women and girls , as well as to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates .  
The reproductive health situation is also very poor , with high-risk programmes , high maternal mortality rates , a high rate of infant and child deaths , high fertility rates , a low contraceptive prevalence rate , a high proportion of unmet reproductive health needs , and the existence of harmful practices such as female genital mutilation . 
What began as a modest capacity-building exercise in delivering birth-spacing services in selected parts of the country has expanded into a full nationwide reproductive health programme which is a fully integrated part of the standard minimum package of activities for primary health-care services .  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .  
The programme , which does away with any mutilation , encourages girls ready to assume their adult responsibilities to seclude themselves for a week during which they receive parts of the traditional education on their future roles as women plus more modern material on health , reproductive problems , effective means of communication , self _ respect and esteem and how to deal with problems they may encounter in their lives as women . 
At the service delivery level , UNFPA assisted in the establishment of a womens centre for reproductive health care , social assistance , legal and psychological counselling and community education at Burej refugee camp , Gaza , which served some 13,000 refugee women in 1998 and is supporting the establishment of a similar centre in the Jabalia refugee camp , Gaza .  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
UNFPA-supported mobile reproductive health clinics in several Asian programme countries also benefit women migrant workers , particularly those in the agricultural sector , as do services provided by non-governmental organization-driven programmes at the community level which target poor women , including migrant women , in marginalized urban areas and free trade zones .  
UNFPA continued to address harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage because of their impact on womens reproductive and sexual health and as violations of womens fundamental human rights .  
The special sessions strong reinforcement of human rights and the human well-being language of the Programme of Action was particularly welcome , as were the calls for intensified action in implementing the Programme of Action , and the new benchmarks in reproductive and sexual health , access to family planning services , reduced maternal mortality , HIV / AIDS prevention , gender issues and education . 
The same perspective was defended during the preparation for the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the April 1995 preparatory seminar that constituted a debating forum on the situation of women : the realization of their civic and political rights ; their economic , social and cultural rights ; their reproductive rights and so-called new rights , inter alia , the right to development and quality of life .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
Not only have we had to battle against established customs and the preachings of a number of conservative sectors , we also although this may be difficult to believe have had to deal with a number of non-governmental organizations which , when they did not get the budgetary support they expected , joined the campaign being waged by some parts of the media and certain political sectors and , betraying their principles , acted in opposition to the reproductive health programmes .  
At the same time , they channel the consciousness of governmental organizations and civil society in order to secure innovative , concerted , intersectorial and multisectorial actions designed to permit a satisfactory sexual and reproductive life at the individual , family and social levels in a climate of equity which promotes healthy and whole lifestyles .  
In short , our population policy comprises a set of measures aimed at influencing reproductive behaviour : education , training , promoting the sexual and reproductive health of our population , promoting the values of Nicaraguan society , the right to life from the moment of conception , access to education and basic health care , the irreplaceable role of the family and the social and cultural survival of ethnic groups .  
At home and on the international stage , New Zealand has sought to play an active role in the promotion of the human rights of women and to ensure their full participation in society as equal partners with men , in particular supporting and encouraging sexual and reproductive health rights and other rights of women , which are central to the Programme of Action .  
I must stress again the need for an increase in international assistance , which we , as a developing country , need if we are to reduce the death rate from the HIV AIDS pandemic , from infectious or parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera , and most of all to meet the needs of young men and women for reproductive and sexual health . 
Securing the right to safe motherhood is also emphasized , along with infertility services and comprehensive care for adolescents in order to promote and develop appropriate sexual and reproductive health and the prevention of cervical , uterine and breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men , while continuing with the national plan for prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV AIDS .  
The significant internal and outward migration for economic reasons of young men particularly to the United States and young women particularly to Europe , especially Spain in recent times ; high rates of maternal mortality ; and the undoubtedly limited sexual and reproductive rights and the rights of women call for specific measures .  
It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Swaziland is in the process of developing a national population policy and a comprehensive reproductive health programme with the participation of representatives of religious leaders , traditional and community leaders , non-governmental organizations , academic institutions , youth and other special groups as well as experts , policy makers and planners .  
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
The problem of HIV AIDS is of prime importance in the policy of the Government of Honduras , and the focus of reproductive rights and of attention to priority vulnerable population groups is therefore principally on promoting low-risk behaviour , through a sustained and systematic information and education campaign , and through increased medical , counselling , hospital and laboratory services for sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS .  
Promoting healthy and responsible behaviour in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health requires profound cultural change , and the Government therefore considers it important to incorporate population issues into curricula at all levels of the national education system .  
We see ourselves as a strong partner with the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) and all other organizations of civil society and Governments in this continued , accelerated and adequately resourced implementation of the key actions of the ICPD Programme of Action , one of the twentieth century ' s major contributions to global thinking about the key role of sexual and reproductive health and rights in promoting equity and development . 
Various workshops and round tables on reproductive health rights and a technical symposium on international migration and development which had called special attention to female migrant workers had been held in the context of the five-year review of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development .  
Short _ term complications can include severe pain and haemorrhage that can lead to shock or even death , while long-term complications can include urine retention , resulting in repeated urinary infections ; obstruction of menstrual flow , leading to frequent reproductive tract infections and infertility ; and prolonged and obstructed labour . 21 Furthermore , FGM can result in psychological problems such as chronic anxiety and depression . 
Nearly 20 , 000 Indian women die every year due to unsafe abortions . 36 Attempts to induce abortion through the use of herbs or roots through the vaginal route , the injection of acid-like fluids into the womb , the use of caustic soda , arsenic and double doses of contraceptive pills , and the insertion of surgical probes , plant stems , wires and toothpicks have harmful reproductive health consequences and may fail to result in successful abortions . 
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services , including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .

An honorary advisory commission on sexual and reproductive health has been formed ; among its other activities , it is studying and formulating standards on medical and ethical problems relating to assisted reproduction .  
Create permanent national and local working groups that include the participation of Governments , NGOs , womens groups and indigenous peoples to ensure that sexual and reproductive rights are explicitly covered in policies and legal reform .  
Female genital mutilation had been banned in many African countries ; policy-makers and healthcare providers in many countries were paying more attention to adolescent reproductive health ; access to health services was being improved for poor rural women and efforts were being made to address the particular vulnerability of women and girl children to the HIV / AIDS epidemic .  
In October 2000 , the Task Force completed new and / or revised Guidelines for the United Nations Resident Coordinator System in the following areas : adolescent sexual and reproductive health ; basic education with special attention to gender disparities ; maternal mortality reduction ; reproductive health ; and HIV / AIDS . UNFPA is actively involved in the reform initiatives of the Secretary-General , and through the UNDG actively contributed to the preparation of the action strategies on halving extreme poverty and girls education . 
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
Services cover maternal care / reproductive health , child health , curative care , dental health , health education / promotion , control of communicable diseases , prevention and control of non-communicable chronic diseases through the promotion of healthy lifestyles , and environmental health services .  
Objectives : ( a ) helping to raise the level of education and training of the Haitian population through improvements to the education system ; ( b ) supporting the economic and social integration of the population through productive employment and social protection ; ( c ) helping to improve the health of the Haitian population in the areas of reproductive health , sexual and child health and sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) / AIDS ; and ( d ) promoting the right to basic social services .  
Within the framework of the memorandum of understanding between ECO and the United Nations Population Fund , five joint activities have taken place , the last being a conference held at Istanbul in May 2000 on expanding contraceptive choice and improving quality of reproductive health programmes .  
In addition , it is important to create an enabling policy environment for improving the situation of rural women , which would include the design and implementation of a gender-sensitive macroeconomic policy framework and social support systems which would accommodate womens productive and reproductive roles and encourage a more equal gender division of labour in the household . 
The principle of voluntary and informed choice in respect of the provision of sexual and reproductive health services should be recognized as a basic human right .
