Regretting the failure of the three Western countries to respond positively to international and regional endeavours and to the efforts made to devise a settlement based on the principles of international law , in a context of mutual understanding and constructive dialogue , with the result that the Security Council , following its consultations of 14 March 1997 , extended the embargo measures imposed on the Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ,  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a more fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
The Committee holds a closed meeting after the constructive dialogue with each State party in order to consider the main issues and tendencies to be reflected in the concluding comment relating to the report of the State party .  4 .  The expert nominated as main country rapporteur drafts the comment in close collaboration with the back-up rapporteur , the general rapporteur of the Committee and the secretariat .  
The transnationals that work in the countries where there are no internal legal frameworks and / or administrative mechanisms that are capable of enforcing and / or providing such involvement of indigenous communities should accept a constructive obligation to respect the guidelines and the fundamental human rights of indigenous peoples . 
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
The new climate of broadening and deepening international cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , was the antithesis of the cold-war , zero-sum-game mentality , which , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world , was giving way to more positive and constructive trends and attitudes .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The Government of the Republic of Angola has always opposed the economic blockade , and the trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on the Republic of Cuba , in violation of the principles of international law and , on the several occasions when this question was discussed in international forums , particularly at the United Nations , Angola voted in favour of an unconditional lifting of such blockade , on the basis of a frank and constructive dialogue , for the benefit of the people of both countries .  
Furthermore , this is a concrete , effective security mechanism that is relatively easy to implement and helps avoid misunderstandings and errors while fostering in-depth , constructive dialogue that enhances mutual understanding and alerts the international community to the excessive stockpiling of weapons .  
In the final days of the regular session the General Assembly and the presidency responded effectively and played an impartial and constructive role in selecting a Secretary-General when assertive unilateralism provoked deadlock in the Security Council and threatened to undermine the integrity of the institution of the United Nations itself .  
Ecuador will continue to participate in these talks , motivated by a true spirit of peace , because we desire a global , final , honourable and realistic solution that reflects the legitimate expectations of our people , which , together with the other peoples of the Americas , are seeking to create a future of mutual benefit and constructive and peaceful cooperation .  
I am convinced that your rich and profound experience in diplomatic relations , together with your personal qualities , will facilitate the constructive work of this General Assembly session and make it an outstanding international event .  
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing interest in establishing or strengthening existing national human rights institutions , as a constructive way to take positive action at the national level , bearing in mind national circumstances , to promote respect for human rights .  Important examples of human rights institutions recently established in my part of the world that are making a difference on the ground include those in India and Indonesia .  
In conclusion , my delegation pledges its support to you , Mr . President , including in your capacity as Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group , to take our work forward in a practical and constructive manner towards an outcome which will result in an expanded , more representative , more transparent Security Council , better equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
The sponsors are submitting these three draft resolutions driven by a strong desire that the Organization should make a further concrete and constructive contribution to the multiplicity of efforts bilateral , multilateral or undertaken by individuals or by Governments aimed at bringing about a comprehensive , just and lasting settlement of the question of Palestine .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
The European Union expects the Disarmament Commission to live up to expectations , and looks forward to working in a constructive and balanced manner in the coming weeks towards concrete results to guide future multilateral disarmament efforts . 
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
As a representative of national organizations which remained in place after international organizations had completed their work , the Federation trusted that more governments would take steps to create an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue and effective cooperation , so that non-governmental organizations could function effectively . 
It was suggested that since the interrelationship between the Sixth Committee and the Commission was a vital component of the functioning of the Commission which must be improved and rendered more effective , the input from the Sixth Committee should therefore be as constructive as possible , whether through responses to questionnaires , through written comments by Governments or through oral comments during the debates on the Commission 's annual report .  
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities .

This was an unusually frank , constructive and collaborative interaction of policy makers who fully realized that concerted actions on an international scale are imperative for effective national responses to the challenges of globalization .  
In supporting those processes , whether at the country level through the resident coordinator system , or at the regional or global levels , UNFPA sought to be constructive in raising issues so that meaningful and sustained progress could be made .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
Tajikistan fully supports the Russian Federation 's constructive position on the Yugoslav problem and , as a country that has experienced the horrors of a civil war , believes that the events in Kosovo will give rise to yet another hotbed of tension , jeopardizing the international community 's efforts to implement international norms based on the principles of peaceful coexistence , non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States . 
The Committee congratulates the Government for the high level and large size of its delegation , headed by the Permanent Representative to the United Nations , which established a constructive , open and sincere dialogue with members of the Committee , and in its oral presentation gave additional specific and objective information as well as statistical data enabling the Committee to understand the de jure and de facto situation of Algerian women .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
I believe that , given the overall state of our relations , we can move forward and embark with determination on the constructive and imaginative search for ways of settling the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas in a manner guaranteed to preserve the way of life of the islanders and ensure the economic prosperity and social well-being of all who live in the South Atlantic .  
Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .  
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
On the other hand , the Special Rapporteur is inclined to argue in favour of the proposition that treaties / agreements or constructive arrangements have the potential to become very important tools ( because of their consensual basis ) for formally establishing and implementing not only the rights and freedoms alluded to in the preceding paragraph , but also inalienable ancestral rights , in particular land rights , in the specific context of a given society .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .  
However , I am of the firm belief that with our strong conviction and commitment , coupled with the wide and constructive participation of all relevant actors and with the support of the international community , we will be able to achieve our common objectives , as set out in the ICPD recommendations .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
Affirms that the informal consultations on measures to ensure international protection for all who need it have proved to be a valuable forum for constructive discussion of complex protection issues in an open manner ; and requests UNHCR , in consultation with States , to continue to organize from time to time , within the limits of available resources , and with broadly based participation , informal expert consultations on protection issues of current concern .  
She encouraged a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding between the worlds indigenous peoples and the Governments concerned and expressed the hoped that substantive and practical proposals would be made at the seventeenth session of the Working Group .  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .

The full realization of the right to development must be addressed within a global context through a constructive , dialogue-based approach , with objectivity , respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity , impartiality , non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles , taking into account the political , historical , social , religious and cultural characteristics of each country ;

The variety and importance of the questions discussed at this session ending today and the earnest and constructive spirit in which they were considered show that , because of its representativeness , its universality , its capacity to listen and to see things from all angles , the United Nations continues to be the sole and central forum for pursuing global dialogue on the fundamental world problems facing mankind .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
We are looking forward to even more close and constructive cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , so that together we can offer the world peace , stability and mutual understanding and create a world based on dialogue between civilizations , on conciliation and on respect for moral values and the rule of law in the relations between nations and peoples .  
It will be necessary in future to support constructive contacts between the OSCE mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the relevant United Nations structures in carrying out such vital tasks as safeguarding the rights of minorities , resolving the problem of refugees and ensuring the effective functioning of the federal and municipal authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
I am happy to point out that I have been encouraged by the open and frank views that I encountered and by the expressed willingness to contribute constructively in the continuing search for workable solutions to overcome the major sticking points on the basis of constructive negotiations , flexibility and compromise .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
My delegation is confident that , with your rich diplomatic experience and wide knowledge of disarmament and international security , under your skilful guidance we will have a fruitful and constructive dialogue on the items on the Committees agenda at this session .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .

We feel that this constructive , pedagogical and united approach , built entirely around the central objective of the full international isolation of Jonas Savimbi and UNITA , will ultimately prove far more productive than a repressive one .  
It was imperative to reverse that dangerous trend , and in that context his country fully supported the New Agenda Coalition , which represented a moderate and constructive approach to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
The following issues are raised to solicit responses from States on the diverse effects of globalization at the national , regional and international levels , as a means of developing understanding for a constructive exchange of views on globalization .  
The constructive role played by civil society organizations in raising public awareness on the issue of conflict diamonds , proposing practical solutions and helping generate the necessary political will required for concrete action .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
This active and constructive policy of Turkmenistans , pursued in parallel with United Nations efforts , has earned it great authority among neighbouring States and in the region as a whole and has secured the rightful promotion of Ashgabat to the rank of recognized peacemaking centres in Asia .  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .  
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .

Concluding comments adopted since the Committee revised its format for concluding comments , at its nineteenth session , include a short introductory section , usually no more than three paragraphs , which address the quality of the report , any other documentation submitted by the State party , the nature of the constructive dialogue with the Committee and the level and composition of the delegation .  
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
As a matter of fact , the Armenian falsifiers conveniently disregard so many facts essential to a humane , spirited , forward-looking and constructive understanding of the tragic events which took place within the fold of a dying and partly occupied country , that as a result , only hatred and rage , unfortunately , govern their general attitude towards the Turks .  
The representative of the European Commission ( EC ) noted that while many of the recommendations of the report of the Expert Meeting had already been tabled in the relevant WTO meetings , the EC was committed to a constructive position in these meetings and therefore supported the report when it called for the issues and recommendations that had been identified therein to be raised in the proper context namely , the WTO Committees , Special Sessions , or in the new trade round .

During the visit , the two sides conducted extensive , constructive , and frank and sincere dialogue ; increased mutual understanding ; and expressed the wish to make a concerted effort to push forward Sino-US relations .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said at today 's news conference that Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , during his visit to the United States , made extensive contact with the US side and exchanged views with the US side in a frank , sincere , and extensive manner on Sino-US relations and some important international and regional issues .  The visit achieved positive and constructive results .  
Zhu Feng : The Chinese government has all along assigned importance to and treasured the stability and constructive development of Sino-US relations .  Sustained intervention by the United States on China 's human rights condition in this process has hurt the friendly feelings of the Chinese people .  It has also widened the scope of disputes between the two countries and artificially complicated and sharpened bilateral relations .  
We were at first worried that the Taiwan authorities would gloat over and revel in the recent US arms deal and the diplomatic victory of Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan . However , we are glad to hear that , after taking the above situations into consideration , the Presidential Office has announced in its statement today that arms purchase is not the only means of guaranteeing Taiwan 's defense , that the two sides of the Strait could only be assured genuine and lasting peace through constructive dialog and the normalization of relations .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
For this reason , the United States began to reconsider China 's strength and ponder if its excessively radical policy to contain and isolate China had damaged US strategic interests and practical economic interests .  It is against this background that US Secretary of State Powell plans to visit Beijing in July and Bush is scheduled to visit China and meet with President Jiang Zemin in October , in a hope to establish constructive relations with China .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
An informed person in Beijing said that because of weak foreign demand , the State Council has decided to continue the policy of expanding domestic demand in the second half of the year .  The Ministry of Finance will apply to the National People 's Congress next month for an additional issue of 50-billion yuan of constructive treasury bonds , and plans to distribute them to commercial banks in late October after the approval .  
Li Rongrong , the chair of this meeting and Chairman of China 's Economic and Trade Commission , said that the meeting with its rich content and packed program produced fruitful results and completed all set agendas without a hitch .  The participating ministers and representatives exchanged their successful practices and experiences at the meeting , put forward many constructive suggestions and proposals , and achieved a common understanding on many issues .

They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .

In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
In view of the global character of problems relating to space debris and their impact on the future course of the conquest of space , it has become a matter of particular urgency to rally the constructive efforts of the major space-faring States in order to tackle the range of scientific and technical problems involved in ensuring the safety of space activity ( manned flights , first and foremost ) under conditions of technogenic space pollution .  
As a representative of national organizations which remained in place after international organizations had completed their work , the Federation trusted that more governments would take steps to create an environment conducive to a constructive dialogue and effective cooperation , so that non-governmental organizations could function effectively . 
It was suggested that since the interrelationship between the Sixth Committee and the Commission was a vital component of the functioning of the Commission which must be improved and rendered more effective , the input from the Sixth Committee should therefore be as constructive as possible , whether through responses to questionnaires , through written comments by Governments or through oral comments during the debates on the Commission 's annual report .  
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
The Commission expects that the activities of the new human rights office in Bogot will contribute to improving the human rights situation in Colombia and to promoting a climate of trust between the Government and all sectors involved in the conflict , encouraging a process of constructive dialogue involving non _ governmental organizations and other sectors of civil society , and to preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities .

The existing constructive nature of the evolution of international relations towards multipolarity is conducive to the creation of a balanced , stable and democratic new world order free from confrontational attitudes .  
The fight against crime called for a genuine political will at the national level , supported by constructive and effective international cooperation in a context of transparency and openness .  
It had organized regional and national meetings and produced television programmes which stressed the role of women in scientific and artistic fields and at the level of information and communities and their constructive presence within civil society .  
This was an unusually frank , constructive and collaborative interaction of policy makers who fully realized that concerted actions on an international scale are imperative for effective national responses to the challenges of globalization .  
In supporting those processes , whether at the country level through the resident coordinator system , or at the regional or global levels , UNFPA sought to be constructive in raising issues so that meaningful and sustained progress could be made .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
Tajikistan fully supports the Russian Federation 's constructive position on the Yugoslav problem and , as a country that has experienced the horrors of a civil war , believes that the events in Kosovo will give rise to yet another hotbed of tension , jeopardizing the international community 's efforts to implement international norms based on the principles of peaceful coexistence , non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States . 
The Committee congratulates the Government for the high level and large size of its delegation , headed by the Permanent Representative to the United Nations , which established a constructive , open and sincere dialogue with members of the Committee , and in its oral presentation gave additional specific and objective information as well as statistical data enabling the Committee to understand the de jure and de facto situation of Algerian women .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
I believe that , given the overall state of our relations , we can move forward and embark with determination on the constructive and imaginative search for ways of settling the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas in a manner guaranteed to preserve the way of life of the islanders and ensure the economic prosperity and social well-being of all who live in the South Atlantic .  
Consequently , the conclusions and recommendations to be offered in the present report will mainly refer to three of the five juridical situations originally identified : ( i ) where there is proof of international treaties / agreements between indigenous peoples and States , ( ii ) where there are no specific bilateral legal instruments to govern relations between indigenous peoples and States ; and ( iii ) situations relating to the question of other constructive arrangements .  
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .  
As far as his mandate is concerned , it must be recalled that the main purpose of the study is to analyse the potential utility of treaties , agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous peoples and Governments for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those peoples .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
On the other hand , the Special Rapporteur is inclined to argue in favour of the proposition that treaties / agreements or constructive arrangements have the potential to become very important tools ( because of their consensual basis ) for formally establishing and implementing not only the rights and freedoms alluded to in the preceding paragraph , but also inalienable ancestral rights , in particular land rights , in the specific context of a given society .  
For the same reasons , it is especially important to assess fully ( or to reassess ) , from the same point of reference , the relevance and potential utility of the quasi-juridical category of constructive arrangements for indigenous peoples still deprived of any formal and consensual relationship with the States in which they now happen to live .  
However , I am of the firm belief that with our strong conviction and commitment , coupled with the wide and constructive participation of all relevant actors and with the support of the international community , we will be able to achieve our common objectives , as set out in the ICPD recommendations .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
Affirms that the informal consultations on measures to ensure international protection for all who need it have proved to be a valuable forum for constructive discussion of complex protection issues in an open manner ; and requests UNHCR , in consultation with States , to continue to organize from time to time , within the limits of available resources , and with broadly based participation , informal expert consultations on protection issues of current concern .  
She encouraged a constructive dialogue and mutual understanding between the worlds indigenous peoples and the Governments concerned and expressed the hoped that substantive and practical proposals would be made at the seventeenth session of the Working Group .  
My Office is more than willing to play its part in implementing the report 's constructive recommendations on the effective implementation of international human rights , humanitarian and refugee law and on the prevention of gross violations of human right so crucial to national and regional stability and thus to international peace and security .  
It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .

The variety and importance of the questions discussed at this session ending today and the earnest and constructive spirit in which they were considered show that , because of its representativeness , its universality , its capacity to listen and to see things from all angles , the United Nations continues to be the sole and central forum for pursuing global dialogue on the fundamental world problems facing mankind .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
We are looking forward to even more close and constructive cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , so that together we can offer the world peace , stability and mutual understanding and create a world based on dialogue between civilizations , on conciliation and on respect for moral values and the rule of law in the relations between nations and peoples .  
It will be necessary in future to support constructive contacts between the OSCE mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the relevant United Nations structures in carrying out such vital tasks as safeguarding the rights of minorities , resolving the problem of refugees and ensuring the effective functioning of the federal and municipal authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
I am happy to point out that I have been encouraged by the open and frank views that I encountered and by the expressed willingness to contribute constructively in the continuing search for workable solutions to overcome the major sticking points on the basis of constructive negotiations , flexibility and compromise .  
My delegation believes that unless we address this question in a constructive and progressive manner and manifest the necessary political will to move on to serious negotiations on a final package , we run the real risk of deepening further the current impasse , thereby increasing the creeping sense of cynicism and pessimism among Member States .  
My delegation is confident that , with your rich diplomatic experience and wide knowledge of disarmament and international security , under your skilful guidance we will have a fruitful and constructive dialogue on the items on the Committees agenda at this session .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .

We feel that this constructive , pedagogical and united approach , built entirely around the central objective of the full international isolation of Jonas Savimbi and UNITA , will ultimately prove far more productive than a repressive one .  
It was imperative to reverse that dangerous trend , and in that context his country fully supported the New Agenda Coalition , which represented a moderate and constructive approach to nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
The following issues are raised to solicit responses from States on the diverse effects of globalization at the national , regional and international levels , as a means of developing understanding for a constructive exchange of views on globalization .  
The constructive role played by civil society organizations in raising public awareness on the issue of conflict diamonds , proposing practical solutions and helping generate the necessary political will required for concrete action .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .  
Likewise , we encourage continued and intensified dialogue between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi , as well as any initiative for constructive dialogue among regional leaders , which would be conducive to mutual trust and to commonly agreed solutions .  
We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia , for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made .  
This active and constructive policy of Turkmenistans , pursued in parallel with United Nations efforts , has earned it great authority among neighbouring States and in the region as a whole and has secured the rightful promotion of Ashgabat to the rank of recognized peacemaking centres in Asia .  
Turkmenistan has consistently and insistently supported the establishment in international relations of a more humane , equitable and constructive order , opposed all forms of discrimination , the isolation of States on political or ideological grounds and the imposition of various types of economic sanctions , embargoes and the like , and urged respect for the distinctive characteristics of each country and its chosen model of social and political development .  
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .

Those adopted at the thirteenth and fourteenth sessions6 are relatively short , addressing in their introduction the quality of the report , whether it complied with the Committees reporting guidelines and the nature of the constructive dialogue ; identifying , in up to four paragraphs , positive aspects with regard to implementation ; pointing to several principal areas of concern ; and concluding with suggestions and recommendations .  The format of concluding comments adopted at those sessions is diverse , with areas of concern not always mirrored by recommendations .  
Concluding comments adopted since the Committee revised its format for concluding comments , at its nineteenth session , include a short introductory section , usually no more than three paragraphs , which address the quality of the report , any other documentation submitted by the State party , the nature of the constructive dialogue with the Committee and the level and composition of the delegation .  
The new democratic Governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in the Republic of Croatia and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have each pledged , and begun to act upon , commitments to constructive bilateral and regional relations based on mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State .  
The main lesson to be drawn from past United Nations experience in this regard is that the earlier the root causes of a potential conflict are identified and effectively addressed , the more likely it is that the parties to a conflict will be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue , address the actual grievances that lie at the root of the potential conflict and refrain from the use of force to achieve their aims .  
As a matter of fact , the Armenian falsifiers conveniently disregard so many facts essential to a humane , spirited , forward-looking and constructive understanding of the tragic events which took place within the fold of a dying and partly occupied country , that as a result , only hatred and rage , unfortunately , govern their general attitude towards the Turks .  
The representative of the European Commission ( EC ) noted that while many of the recommendations of the report of the Expert Meeting had already been tabled in the relevant WTO meetings , the EC was committed to a constructive position in these meetings and therefore supported the report when it called for the issues and recommendations that had been identified therein to be raised in the proper context namely , the WTO Committees , Special Sessions , or in the new trade round .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
At its 25th meeting , on 15 August 2001 , the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights , having considered the final working paper submitted by the Special Rapporteur , Ms . Erica-Irene A . Daes , on indigenous peoples and their relationship to land ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 2001 / 21 ) , having heard the significant and constructive statement by the Special Rapporteur and expressing deepest appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent , valuable final working paper , decided :  
The Special Rapporteur is pleased to report that , since the ongoing transitional process began , there have been apparent some substantial signals indicative of the Governments inclination to engage in a constructive dialogue on human rights .  
Commending the positive and constructive role played by refugee-hosting countries and recognizing at the same time the heavy burden borne by some , particularly developing countries and countries with economies in transition , as well as the protracted nature of many refugee situations and the absence of timely and safe solutions ,  
We appreciate the importance of the positive societal contribution of the communications media in promoting democratic values and in the responsible exercise of their right to freedom of expression so that , through constructive and instructive criticism , they can promote sound and transparent governance on the part of our leaders .
