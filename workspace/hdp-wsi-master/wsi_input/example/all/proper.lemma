One of the first national measures promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs was in May 1981 . This legislation sought to contain the violation of trademarks and the false marks of " made in . . . " trend in domestic manufacturing of counterfeit goods . Conditions of this measure included : All products manufactured in the country had to have a label stating made in the Republic of China as well as proper evidence of registration from importing countries for OEM items .  
The female side also saw vivid and fine performances . Ying-ying ( lyrical soprano ) was cast as a refined , proper young woman , whose heart was quick to separate those she loved from those she detested . Her wise maid Hung Niang ( coloratura soprano ) let no obstacles daunt her in the pursuit of what was right , while Ts'ui 's mother ( mezzo soprano ) , caught between obligation to her husband and gratitude to Chang Sheng , found her emotions conflicted , uncertain as to how to solve this terrible dilemma .  
Maintaining trade secrets is vital to high-technology industries , and so the park enforces tight security . People entering and leaving are checked for identification , and the park forms something of an independent living space separated from Hsinchu proper , with its own residences , activity center , athletic field , swimming pool , library , school , and so forth .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
The secret of what meaning Liu Bowen really intended his poem to convey went with him to his grave ; but many believers did go to Tienhoukung Temple in Lukang to ask how the temple oracle could have been so mistaken . The temple elders came out in person to make it clear that " this was probably just hearsay or even a hoax , we do n't think the divination was made according to the proper practice , so of course its credibility is doubtful . "  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
But a month later , when the planting , harvesting and sale of quick-growing vegetables had resumed down in the plains , there were still many places on the Northern Cross-Island Highway where the road bed was continuing to collapse and the surface still being washed away , and rocks were still falling down the mountainsides . As for various farming access roads which were never graded or built on proper foundations in the first place , whenever it rains many of them simply " disappear . "  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
If they do n't deal with the psychological impact of these experiences and seek counseling , these nightmarish incidents are likely to haunt them for the rest of their lives . The littleboy victims often turn into perpetrators themselves , whereas the girls tend toward the opposite extreme . Their own bodies have been so violated that their sense of proper boundaries has been weakened , and they grow up to become women who are repeatedly raped .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
Worse still , says Li Tiao-yang , manager of the construction division of Shin Kong Life Insurance Company , " The moment many people buy a flat , they go on a grand renovation spree , and start ripping out walls and reducing or removing columns . Some of them even do n't mind breaking into the services shaft , so that their upstairs and downstairs neighbors end up not even getting a proper TV signal . " This is something many residents of high-rise apartment blocks have personally experienced .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
In fact , I 'm furious with it , but what can I do ? " The leaders of 23 local governments signed a petition demanding that the central government allocate still more of the Tax Redistribution Fund to them . " The petition was immediately supported by everyone , regardless of party affiliation , and regardless of whether they were on Taiwan proper or its outlying islands . "  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
If the proper degree of focus is placed on each of these skills ( i.e . , a 70% focus at the elementary level on listening and speaking , with a gradually increasing emphasis thereafter on reading and writing as students advance through the higher grades ) , we can say good-bye to the problem of elementary students failing to find the groove in junior high due to a change in teaching methods .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
The only thing they can do is control their weight by eating the proper foods . The hospital invented a game to teach children how to identify healthy snacks . Low-nutrition , high-calorie goodies such as cakes , chocolates , potato chips , and french fries are assigned a red light , indicating that they should not be eaten too often . Hamburgers , fried chicken , and milk shakes are basically healthy , but are high in fat content and are thus assigned a yellow light , indicating that children should eat these foods in moderation .  
While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
In his experience , eggs must be the proper shape , neither too round nor too oblong , with smooth and even contours , and creamy white like ivory in hue . The whiter the color , the more lime there is in the shell and the less calcium , resulting in a shell that is too brittle and not suitable for carving .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
According to Chi , single mothers receive very little support in Taiwan . At the GHF , for example , only a minority of girls who decide to keep their baby get any financial or emotional support from their parents , and then only after considerable resistance from them . Most unmarried girls who choose the hard road of raising their child , do so without the proper skills or support from their family or boyfriend .  
Dr . Chiang points out that allergies are chronic and persistent inflammatory reactions . When an allergy sufferer is constantly exposed to an allergen , and allergic symptoms and inflammation recur in a continuous cycle of attack and recovery , this may result in irreversible bronchial fibrosis and involuntary-muscle transformation that inhibits proper expansion and contraction of the airways . In such cases , the spontaneous healing of allergic conditions that usually occurs during the teenage years may not be enough to offset bronchial fibrosis .  
The Pan Kung gate is the outermost gate of the temple , but during their occupation of Taiwan the Japanese split the gate from the rest of the temple structure when they built Nanmen Road between them . Since the gate was split from the temple proper , its real purpose has gradually faded from collective memory , so it 's not surprising so few people realize it 's actually part of the temple .

Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers .

To achieve this , Africa 's partners must transcend their previous ideas about cooperation with the continent and must overcome the accompanying donor fatigue , and must count on Africa 's natural determination to develop a dynamic of progress by which it will gain its proper place in the vast movement of international cooperation that is beneficial for all .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .

The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market . 
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
The system must therefore be reviewed and updated so that resolutions are of the highest technical quality , carry proper moral weight and have the proper deterrent effect , are carried out with the swiftness required in order to protect and compensate the victims and are respected and implemented promptly by the relevant bodies .

Conditions of this measure included : All products manufactured in the country had to have a label stating made in the Republic of China as well as proper evidence of registration from importing countries for OEM items .  
The female side also saw vivid and fine performances . Ying-ying ( lyrical soprano ) was cast as a refined , proper young woman , whose heart was quick to separate those she loved from those she detested . Her wise maid Hung Niang ( coloratura soprano ) let no obstacles daunt her in the pursuit of what was right , while Ts'ui 's mother ( mezzo soprano ) , caught between obligation to her husband and gratitude to Chang Sheng , found her emotions conflicted , uncertain as to how to solve this terrible dilemma .  
Maintaining trade secrets is vital to high-technology industries , and so the park enforces tight security . People entering and leaving are checked for identification , and the park forms something of an independent living space separated from Hsinchu proper , with its own residences , activity center , athletic field , swimming pool , library , school , and so forth .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
It is true that there are many experienced hawk-raisers who are dedicated to proper care of the birds , who learn from the West , collecting information and videotapes , who follow the regulations carefully , and who moreover draw a clear line being themselves and amateurs or those who are just playing around . Still , many environmental scholars point out that Taiwan is densely populated , with few resources and very little hinterland , and it is very arguable whether or not this place is suitable for hawk-raising at any level .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
The secret of what meaning Liu Bowen really intended his poem to convey went with him to his grave ; but many believers did go to Tienhoukung Temple in Lukang to ask how the temple oracle could have been so mistaken . The temple elders came out in person to make it clear that " this was probably just hearsay or even a hoax , we do n't think the divination was made according to the proper practice , so of course its credibility is doubtful . "  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
These included the rites for weddings , funerals , birthdays , and anniversaries , as well as the ways to dispel bad luck or to correct malevolent influences . Chien Cheng-tung is , like Lin , a consultant for the annual Taipei Chinese Food Festival , though Chien has chosen the career path of being a hotel chef . He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
Up to the time that they removed the Zheng clan from power in Taiwan , some members of the Qing court held that they should just let the island be , describing it as " an undeveloped place with little tax revenue that is separated from the mainland by a strait and hard to administer . " They did n't even think it should be included in maps of China proper .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
But a month later , when the planting , harvesting and sale of quick-growing vegetables had resumed down in the plains , there were still many places on the Northern Cross-Island Highway where the road bed was continuing to collapse and the surface still being washed away , and rocks were still falling down the mountainsides . As for various farming access roads which were never graded or built on proper foundations in the first place , whenever it rains many of them simply " disappear . "  
The female prosecutors tend to be a bit more cautious in these matters , paying careful attention to legal and procedural demands . Although this is only proper in respecting human rights , still the police often feel frustrated as a result .  
If they do n't deal with the psychological impact of these experiences and seek counseling , these nightmarish incidents are likely to haunt them for the rest of their lives . The littleboy victims often turn into perpetrators themselves , whereas the girls tend toward the opposite extreme . Their own bodies have been so violated that their sense of proper boundaries has been weakened , and they grow up to become women who are repeatedly raped .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
The swelling ranks of the elderly will have tremendous implications for the distribution of social resources . To set proper policy requires an adequate grounding of research into seniors ' physical and mental health as well as their economic and family situations .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
The Chinese place great importance on eventually returning to their roots , and always hope to be buried close to home . But many political prisoners never returned to Taiwan proper and were buried in Green Island graves . Their broken tombstones give testimony to half a century of tragic suffering . How can we forget them ?  
Many people would regard taking proper care of animals as a basic standard of human morality , and many lavish great devotion on their family pets . But in fact , when the interests of pets or of animals raised as food or for medical research conflict with those of humans , people often fail to consider their physical and mental well-being .  
In another flagrant violation of procedure , a prosecutor once asked a suspect to place his foot into a footprint in order to check whether it matched . Says the police official , " It would have been devastating if this destruction of the evidence had led to a ruling of not guilty for lack of evidence . " It is n't just the general public that has a fuzzy understanding of how to conduct a proper investigation ; even some law enforcement professionals have problems !  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
Worse still , says Li Tiao-yang , manager of the construction division of Shin Kong Life Insurance Company , " The moment many people buy a flat , they go on a grand renovation spree , and start ripping out walls and reducing or removing columns . Some of them even do n't mind breaking into the services shaft , so that their upstairs and downstairs neighbors end up not even getting a proper TV signal . " This is something many residents of high-rise apartment blocks have personally experienced .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
In fact , I 'm furious with it , but what can I do ? " The leaders of 23 local governments signed a petition demanding that the central government allocate still more of the Tax Redistribution Fund to them . " The petition was immediately supported by everyone , regardless of party affiliation , and regardless of whether they were on Taiwan proper or its outlying islands . "  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site . These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .  
When the regulations were announced , 90% of major international producers , including NEC and Fujitsu , discovered that their previous efforts in the field had been wasted . Startek , however , had correctly guessed that recognition standards would be based on key points for each print . Startek is now one of only three firms anywhere in the world that can provide the proper fingerprint recognition software , and its products are technically the most advanced .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
If the proper degree of focus is placed on each of these skills ( i.e . , a 70% focus at the elementary level on listening and speaking , with a gradually increasing emphasis thereafter on reading and writing as students advance through the higher grades ) , we can say good-bye to the problem of elementary students failing to find the groove in junior high due to a change in teaching methods .  
The Council for Economic and Development ( CEPD ) , which is supposed to take overall charge of economic development policy , failed to play its proper coordinating role . The Ministry of Economic Affairs was consumed by the struggle over nuclear power , and failed to pay enough attention to the need to adjust Taiwan 's industrial structure . The Ministry of Finance was busy trying to support share prices on Taiwan 's stock market , but in doing so resorted to measures that violated market principles .  
The only thing they can do is control their weight by eating the proper foods . The hospital invented a game to teach children how to identify healthy snacks . Low-nutrition , high-calorie goodies such as cakes , chocolates , potato chips , and french fries are assigned a red light , indicating that they should not be eaten too often . Hamburgers , fried chicken , and milk shakes are basically healthy , but are high in fat content and are thus assigned a yellow light , indicating that children should eat these foods in moderation .  
While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
In his experience , eggs must be the proper shape , neither too round nor too oblong , with smooth and even contours , and creamy white like ivory in hue . The whiter the color , the more lime there is in the shell and the less calcium , resulting in a shell that is too brittle and not suitable for carving .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
According to Chi , single mothers receive very little support in Taiwan . At the GHF , for example , only a minority of girls who decide to keep their baby get any financial or emotional support from their parents , and then only after considerable resistance from them . Most unmarried girls who choose the hard road of raising their child , do so without the proper skills or support from their family or boyfriend .  
Dr . Chiang points out that allergies are chronic and persistent inflammatory reactions . When an allergy sufferer is constantly exposed to an allergen , and allergic symptoms and inflammation recur in a continuous cycle of attack and recovery , this may result in irreversible bronchial fibrosis and involuntary-muscle transformation that inhibits proper expansion and contraction of the airways . In such cases , the spontaneous healing of allergic conditions that usually occurs during the teenage years may not be enough to offset bronchial fibrosis .  
The Pan Kung gate is the outermost gate of the temple , but during their occupation of Taiwan the Japanese split the gate from the rest of the temple structure when they built Nanmen Road between them . Since the gate was split from the temple proper , its real purpose has gradually faded from collective memory , so it 's not surprising so few people realize it 's actually part of the temple .

Although the United Nations Environment Programme was an important step forward for the protection of the biosphere , consideration should be given the possibility of creating , after proper study , an ecological response embodied in a United Nations environmental security council composed of Member States with a permanent 15-member executive committee and a secretary-general with executive powers .

To achieve this , Africa 's partners must transcend their previous ideas about cooperation with the continent and must overcome the accompanying donor fatigue , and must count on Africa 's natural determination to develop a dynamic of progress by which it will gain its proper place in the vast movement of international cooperation that is beneficial for all .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .

The representative replied that the third periodic report , which noted the Ombudsman 's request for a more effective affirmative action policy , explained that the view of the Gender Equality Ombudsman was that existing affirmative action measures should either be strengthened to gain proper effect , or abolished altogether , as in her opinion the existing arrangements served to give the public unrealistic notions of women 's opportunities in the labour market . 
National legal systems allowing for punitive or exemplary damages usually do so only where there has been a deliberate misdeed or gross negligence ; in such cases , the proper course of action for the Organization would be to bring disciplinary charges against the offending staff member or recovery action from him or her of the damages paid by the Organization for the actual loss suffered by the victim . 
The system must therefore be reviewed and updated so that resolutions are of the highest technical quality , carry proper moral weight and have the proper deterrent effect , are carried out with the swiftness required in order to protect and compensate the victims and are respected and implemented promptly by the relevant bodies .
