Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
When he learned who had written it , he tried to visit Hsu whenever he came to Hsin An , but he never succeeded in seeing him . Li Po once left a poem behind on the wall of his hut : Having copied and recited your poems , I 've come to visit the immortal 's dwelling . But your traces are lost in the misty peaks , where cloudy forests part the primal void .  
She looked at the children in front of her . In the middle was one dressed in a white suit ; on the left a little one wearing a lace frilly skirt with a pattern of little flowers with a peach red sweater ; and on the right one with bright yellow sweats , with an adorable Mickey Mouse on the front .  
During the cold winter season it lost all its leaves , and only barren branches are left to wait for the spring . As I watch them , the withered branches seem especially strong and unyielding in the dark . Some of the branches bud early and are soon covered with tender green leaves , transparent , smooth and clean . The veins on each heart-shaped leaf are clear to the scrutiny of night .  
The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them . During the seventeenth century the aborigines still lived by hunting and fishing , and the Han Chinese immigrants were mostly poor farmers and fishermen who left no written records behind , while the historical documents of the Cheng clan ( descendants of the Ming loyalist Koxinga ) were destroyed during the Ching dynasty .  
From transient visitors who left their hometowns for a temporary stay there , they have made themselves into the sector of the populace with the most economic clout on the island , but owing to special historical and geographical factors , they have been unable to shake off the psychology of transience .  
But in fact the supposed tradition stretched back no further : my teachers ' teachers , many of them scholars of foreign origin , were the generation that had established Chinese studies in Britain on a professional footing . They had to learn a lot more by themselves and it was hard to find a good teacher , J . K . Fairbank reveals that when he arrived at Oxford in the 1930s , eager to learn Chinese , Soothill left him to fend for himself .  
Especially after the end of the Second World War , which left the country , like the U . S . , relatively unscathed , its strong economy , which ranked among the world 's top , and its abundant capital at the time laid a good foundation for the development of its universities and academic research .  
Going south along Hsin Sheng South Road past Hsin Yi Road , you pass the Chin Hua Girls ' Senior High and Taipei Mosque on the right , and on the left stretches the zone designated for the No . 7 municipal park . Here stands a row of car repair garages which , once they close down after dark , turn into a deserted oasis of darkness long familiar to Taipei residents .  
That he could return to his homeland was naturally some consolation to him in his final years , but it is still a pity that Eight Virtues Garden lost its owner and was expropriated so soon . The remaining rocks and trees were sold or stolen ; the gibbons and other rare animals were sent to the Sao Paolo zoo ; and Great Wind Hall was left ankle deep in exquisite Chinese paper and scrolls .  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
So prudent parents ship their kid off early to one of the numerous cram schools around the city , to a " supplemental class for the exceptionally gifted , " " children 's potential enhancement center " or " simultaneous development course for the left and right sides of the brain . "  
Along the path , the " Eight Family Generals , " with colorfully painted faces , straw shoes , and with the implements of worship in hand , are responsible for sweeping away evil and demons and protecting the divine entourage . The Centipede chen and the Golden Lion chen , with similarly divine capabilities , take the left and right points , clearing a path for Wang Tieh . As noon approaches , the hot sun pounds on the processionists .  
At the sound of the drum , the groom heaps into the air , does a leg split , and comes down sitting firmly on the ground . The drumming comes to an abrupt halt , and all you can hear in the frozen air is the sound of the groom breathing . Members of the troupe rush over to pull off the groom 's left stilt .  
When the decision of where to put the railroad station is finally settled at the end of September , " the bear market will certainly appear , " says Tsai Cheng-lin . It seems just like a balloon carried high by the wind only to be left stuck in mid-air when the breeze slackens , then briefly buffeted before the inevitable descent ; what is so strange is that property prices can be this fragile - - tossed around so easily by the hot air of groundless rumors . (  
Splendid at sunset , the grand old city evokes the bygone days of the Portuguese , the Dutch and the British , who each came , ruled the city in turn and left behind buildings in their characteristic architectural styles . Combined with the mosques of the native Malaysians and the quaint temples and alleyways of the immigrant Chinese , they all go to make up the old city 's distinctive tapestry .  
We rested on a platform that seemed to overlook the whole planet . The settlement was visible far away at the mountain 's foot , girdled by a white stream flowing in a bow-shape to its left before meandering off into the west to shake hands with a row of low clouds .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
On the software side , going into a modern theater meant the plot had to be tight and polished , not like the traditional outdoor stage with just a broad idea and the content left to the actors ' emotions to elaborate .  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
In the conservative period of martial law , not only was the showing of violent films illegal , it was also not legal to publicly show most classic films because their " excessive sexuality is not fit for the national situation " or because they were considered politically sensitive . This left most classic film lovers no place to turn .  
Having seen his friend die with his own eyes , Chiang was grief stricken , but that very afternoon he still had to fly over the presidential offices and form a perfect " 60 " in the blue sky to celebrate the country 's 60th anniversary . Parting for life is hard : Pilots understand the danger of their work and have learned to accept the misfortune of others . But it is hard for loved ones that have been left behind .  
Chinese ho-yuan could be connected together or divided up , " he explains . After a large family subdivides and each member forms his own family , one need only close the side doors of the rooms ; the main compound and the hulung , or auxiliary rooms set off to the left and right of the main com pound ( separated by an open-air pathway ) , can then become two independent bodies .  
Then there was the outbreak of a disease that left people with blackened feet in the coastal area of southern Chiayi which has been proved by experts on contagious diseases to have been related to the protracted use of underground water containing too much arsenic for drinking . "  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
Around six months later comes Double Ninth , which falls on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month . Scholars believe that ascending a height is a custom left over from prehistoric times , when people climbed hills to escape floods . The tradition arose during the Han Dynasty that " double nine " was an unlucky day liable to disaster , and the literati of later dynasties would climb a height and wax lyrical on the passing seasons .  
But because those who have left find themselves in a strange environment and often adapt poorly , this creates even greater pressures . Forty-nine-year-old Chiu Chin-shih , who has spent half his life on the plain studying , living , and working , uses his own experience as an example : If an aborigine is competing with someone else for a job , unless one is extremely outstanding and the only one qualified , if it 's a situation where only one guy is going to get hired , they wo n't take the aborigine .  
The earliest flower and bird paintings had excellent colors and beautifully delicate and detailed brush work , as can be seen in the work of the court painter Huang Chuan of the Western Hsu in the period of the Five Dynasties . The album he left for his son is just like today 's illustrations with the subjects scattered on the paper with no apparent relationship , as though waiting to supply people with information .  
Such is the case with the banyan , the timber of which is easily distorted ; the Formosan sweet gum , which people do not like to cut because it bleeds red sap ; and the autumn maple tree with its knotty trunk . Together , these make up more than half the old trees presently listed by the D . A . F . Thanks to the temples many old trees are left standing .  
But when you look a little closer , the slightly bent back , the thinning hair , and the fingers , misshapen and arthritic from overwork , all unintentionally reveal the marks left on him by long and arduous effort and by the passage of time . God 's will : Thirty-two years . The time this foreign doctor has spent in Taiwan just happens to be same as that spent in his native land . "  
" The lonely eagle : " An eagle is circling / The wind along the high ridge inspiring its wings / Those days just before you left / You seemed evasive , restless / So like a gaunt eagle anxious to fly / . . . " - Chen Yi-chih . Accompanying human history over thousands of years , the birds of prey have never been tamed . Their genes know no code for " obedience " or " companionship . "  
Lu Nianhua , owner of the Ruby Chinese Restaurant in Paris , left Mainland China and went to work in France at the age of twenty , and only three years later became a restaurant owner . But he says that he did n't have any special secret at all for getting rich quick - - it was all thanks to Wenzhou people 's " magic flute " for whistling up mutual prosperity : the " monthly club . "  
When you get to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial in Taipei , you see a gaggle of men dressed up as " old grandmas . " Their faces are painted with rouge , and they wear skirts splashed with red and green . They carry fans in their left hands and parasols in their right . The gaudy makeup attracts a great number of curious people who want to have commemorative photos taken .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
It 's just too bad that 12 years ago when the entire village moved down to the plains , their old village was left abandoned , its streets and gardens weed choked and its stone walls toppled .  
Some calculating employees could tell that my husband was n't completely in support of me . To my surprise , they conspired to make my standing worse . Sometimes in public with a lot of people around , my husband scolded me , and after he left the room the employees treated my with a cold , haughty air .  
I really feel that this is unfair to the workers of the Water Conservancy Bureau . I am also greatly concerned that no scenic places will be left for our future generations . I implore the various relevant agencies to do away with their own opinions , to put aside egotistical , improper behavior , and to think more of the generations to come !  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
Once I helped people pass out leaflets , but my boss got mad at me because I was slow , and I left . I went to a boxed lunch shop and helped them carry the boxed lunches , but it was too tiring . After a week , I did n't go back . Then I worked at my brother 's friend 's travel agency answering phones for two months .  
And so in 1901 , when the Governor-General 's Residence was completed ( now the Taipei Guest House ) , it was luxuriously expansive and well appointed . The Japanese craftsmen designed the space imitating the baroque style in order to show their noble authority . Widening Tungmen Street , which originally led through the East Gate , they left the Gate as the center of a traffic circle , so as to make it convenient for military parades as well as every-day horses and carriages . Full of traffic , the road was very impressive .  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
Those amazing Chinese parents " All things are beneath contempt , only education is to be esteemed . " " Only if you suffer can you surpass others . " The ancient sages have left many a pithy phrase to inspire us to greater heights . They articulate the line of thinking in Chinese culture which argues that learning is the only path to respectable success .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
When speaking of the photography process , Chen remarks that in the beginning she was extremely precise and painstaking about the style of photography , and she discussed it with the photo company 's service lady for a long time . She even filled out a lengthy questionnaire . " Finally , " says Chen Mei-ling , " the photographer arrived , and before we exchanged two sentences , he wrote down the words ' Dignified and demure . ' " The results left her feeling disappointed .  
In the painting " Spring Thunder , " with the damp cold of its steely grey color scheme , a white flash of lightning steaks out from the left , while amid gusts of rain , plants bend rightward in the direction of the lightning .  
If you walk on beyond the Mother Temple 's main entrance , you might notice that most of the edifices are inscribed with the donors ' names . Stepping up 323 stone steps , and looking up , you 'll see the towering gate constructed on behalf of Tachia 's Chenlan Temple . After passing through the main square , you 'll find that the bell and drum pavilions situated on the left and right are dedicated by two business people , a brother and sister from Taiwan surnamed Chen .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
The notion of female chastity began to be reinforced . Previously it had been common for widows to remarry , but from the Song onwards remarriage was seen as " unchaste , " and was not tolerated by the society of the time . Stories such as " The widow cutting off her arm " ( after it had been accidentally touched by a man ) and " An injured breast left untreated " ( because exposure to the doctor 's gaze would have been worse than death ) were taken as models and ideals and widely promoted .  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed . Someone who is hypnotized enters a trance-like state controlled by the right hemisphere .  
The occasion is a lively one , with the sounds of accompanying husbands and babies mingling in with the Indonesian chatter of the brides . 37-year-old Ah Chuan , a farmer , left off the booze this morning and is sitting dutifully at the back of the classroom , accompanying his heavily pregnant wife Liu Sai-chu . " A lot of us have married Indonesians in the last couple of years , " he says , cracking a crude grin .  
Off to the right , light green squares are inlaid amidst dark verdant patches of mango trees and sparkling streams running through gorges . This is where we plan to land . Off to the left , the little spot of white amidst the puffs of smoke and dense green is Saichia Village . When you lift your gaze to the horizon , your field of vision takes in Kaoshu , Chishan , and Pingtung .  
For instance , irregular meal times have given him digestion problems ; he has hemorrhoids from long hours in the driver 's seat ; driving with the windows closed and the air conditioning on to keep out the polluted air gives him aching joints ; watching the road and traffic signals all day tires his eyes and makes his vision blurry ; using the clutch constantly in stop-go traffic leaves his left leg painful and weak , and so on .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Yet , however minute the design may get , there can not be any shortcomings , or the result will be great controversy . The stamp commemorating the DGP 's 90th anniversary featured an airplane with the ROC flag on the tail . The designer depicted the plane as seen from its left side . Faithful to reality , he placed the white sun symbol of the ROC flag in the upper right-hand corner of the flag ( it is ordinarily in the upper left hand corner ) .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
The Chinese have always sought stability and order , and they make a big deal about how their residences and tombs are oriented . " With a dragon on the left and tiger on the right to ward off bad luck and with a rose finch and a black soldier to regulate the Yin and Yang , " it was believed , " children and grandchildren will surround you and your ancestors will be happy and prosperous . "  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
When a full scoop tilted down and struck the trip lever , a connecting rod joined to the trip lever pulled sharply downwards on the weighted end of the upper balance lever . This raised the opposite end of the lever , jerking open the left upper lock , which was joined to it by another connecting rod . This released the drive wheel , allowing it to turn due to the imbalance between the empty scoops on one side and the full scoops on the other .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
At that time , yew wood was not considered suitable for making utensils . The only thing it was thought fit for was to be burnt to make charcoal . But big yews left standing in the forests were put to another use : with their well-developed root systems , they could be used as anchoring points when moving timber : steel cables would be run around them to haul together the logs from felled trees .  
The correct way to treat the dying person before the conscious soul has left the body is to keep the room quiet , and not perform the above actions on the patient , so as to keep the soul peaceful and safe .  
As the end approaches it is best if the patient can lie in the auspicious position with their head to the north and their face to the west , but this should not be forced , and after breathing stops they should be left to lie naturally , and not moved .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
Upon entering the clean room , you see large machines in a row : The " ion implant machine " lays a membrane on the chip . Then , in a process called photolithography , the circuit design is projected onto the surface using glass " photomasks . " Then the chip goes into the " etch " process , where areas of excess metal ( i.e . metal which is outside the design projected on to the chip ) are chemically eroded away . What is left is are rows of oblong dies .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
They have great vitality and are adapted to hostile conditions . The pine seeds grow wherever they fall : in cracks in rocks , on precipices . Thus they appear in tenacious postures , even clinging crazily to sheer crags . In late Autumn , when other trees have shed their leaves and the flowers have all withered , often all that is left is the " lone pine on a winter ridge . "  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
Born and raised in Kaohsiung , Chen left his home for a decade , coming to Taipei to attend university and graduate school and to work . He moved back to Kaohsiung only in 1993 , and only then did he discover how much his old hometown had changed . To refamiliarize himself with the old stomping grounds , he signed up to be a guide with the Takao Hill Association . " The more I came to understand it , the more I treasured this piece of earth .  
According to his study of the subject , the patterns on Damascus swords are the natural crystal patterns formed when steel is cast , and those on Japanese swords are lines of temper color left by partial quenching of the blades . But the patterns on Chinese hundred-beaten steel are the grain patterns which result from repeated folding and hammering of the metal .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
What one sees is what is left after the violence , circles of shards amid the silence . With Tsong Pu 's exquisite and mature installation technique , the small and large pottery shards arranged in their disordered way create a rhythm between strong and weak and rising and falling that is similar to what is found in poetry .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
Modern radio people are a diverse group : senior broadcaster Luo Hsiao-yun often hosts press conferences for pop stars ( top left ) ; Su Lai , who was originally a pop star himself , likes radio work because he gets to play music and talk about his emotions ( bottom left ) ; Li Ming-jou , a hot young radio show host , makes a commercial endorsement ( above ) .  
In the Palace Museum in Beijing , there is a painting entitled Listening to the Qin , by Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty . In it , a brown-robed Daoist sits playing a qin under a pine tree . To left and right are " Two quietly musing guests , one with head raised , one with head bowed / To hear that stringless playing . " In the center of the picture , on a strangely shaped stone which serves as a pedestal , stands an elegant potted plant .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Having been left without parents when a child , Fang-liang was always the caring mother . Her husband was a strict father in the traditional mold . He would beat the children when they did something wrong , to the sound of Fang-liang imploring him to stop in her Ningbo dialect .  
Yet he was also left with a deep impression of Fang-liang as happy and lively , hospitable , talkative , and sociable . Chiang Ching-kuo 's attitude towards her was one of extreme closeness , and he was full of love and respect for her , leaving her the true master of the house .  
Some years ago , Mai Jan-mei was director of guidance at another Taipei middle school , located in one of the city 's most infamous criminal areas . At that time some pupils formed a gang and began causing trouble . They padded their left shoulders up high and went around the school terrorizing the other children ; even teachers did n't dare mess with them .  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
When the Kaohsiung Museum of Science opened last year , it experienced disaster in the form of crowds which damaged exhibits . After staff had cleaned up , the museum hired a large number of temporary personnel and brought in additional volunteers to help see it through the Lunar New Year 's holidays . But the nightmare repeated itself , and many volunteers were left scrubbing betelnut juice from the floors after the museum closed .  
But sadly life is an inescapable obligation , and King Mu had not finished his duties here below . As he left , the Queen Mother 's parting words to him were : " Though the peaks stand as high as the clouds , you crossed mountains and rivers to come from the distant east ; may you live to be a hundred , and may we meet again . "  
Although in the minds of the ancients fairylands were extensions of the real world , the more distant and unattainable they were , the more scope they left for the imagination . The island of Penglai was hazy and indistinct , and the mountains of Kunlun vague and remote .  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
If the star is successful , the program pays for the person 's desired prize ; otherwise , the person 's hope is left unrealized . The format of this segment resembles the old show Loving Heart , which encouraged people to help some unfortunate . But the new program has an even more direct emotional appeal insofar as it cuts in live shots of the reactions of the hosts and audience members , sometimes zooming in on the superstar celebrities as they weep .  
Each time , this man who had said he just wanted to go peacefully was yanked back from the brink of death by his doctors . He received more than a thousand heart stimulant injections , for which a long and sharp needle must pierce the heart itself . The extreme pressure from the CPR which he received on numerous occasions had left several of his ribs broken . And his skin had turned black , burned by the repeated electrical charges . . . .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation . He points out that in the past the education system was conservative . Sex was considered to be dirty and vulgar , not worthy of the halls of knowledge . Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
Another factor was that in the wake of Pearl Harbor , there were only limited numbers of fit , potential conscripts left in Japan , and with the expansion of the Japanese lines from the Pacific to Southeast Asia , the tough , hardworking aboriginal youths , with their knack for fighting in forested mountain terrain , naturally became a priority consideration .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
These unfamiliar strangers from the distant past left everyone speechless . Day and night , the archeologists dug feverishly for more ancient relics . About a month after the discovery of pit # 1 , another brick worker came running with the news that he had dug up two more heads some 30 meters away . He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
That 's when he left behind the fingerprints . " It was these fingerprints that enabled the police to crack the case . The uncanny ability of the police to solve difficult cases has led some to quip that investigators have a crystal ball in their possession . To be sure , forensic science makes the crystal ball work better , but the crystal ball itself is something else entirely-the careful reasoning of seasoned investigators .  
" In the past , the scrap left behind in Wanli had little recycling value , so it was simply burnt , " says Tony Kang , an assistant manager at Taiwan May Chia Metal Company ( TMCM ) . But the mixed electronics wastes such as printed circuit boards which make up the bulk of electrical scrap today contain many valuable heavy metals which can be recovered and sold after intermediate processes such as sorting and smelting .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
An elderly gent named Chang , who left Taiwan 20 years ago and returned a couple of years ago , is amazed when he sees cartoons lampooning national leaders or when radio commentators say national figures ' " brains are on the fritz . " Is this is the same country that he left all those years ago because of its suffocating and oppressive atmosphere ?  
He continues : " Actually he was talking about things on the spiritual plane , but who 'd have thought that so soon afterwards Puli would be left in such an appalling state by an earthquake , as if it really was sunk . So we all joked that he has ' second sight . ' " " In fact he had been extremely despondent , and that 's why he was eager to turn from mere thinking and observation to action , by doing some concrete community work .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
On the evening of October 22 , the late autumn air of Taipei was just a little chilly , but the plaza in front of the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall was hot and teeming with people . More than 10,000 music fans were crowded together , some sitting , some standing , all waiting for the concert " Nature and Hope : A Voyage to Paradise . " The show was a benefit concert for the Eden Foundation , to help those who were left physically handicapped by the Sept . 21 earthquake .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
In 1928 , the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking was terminated , and a new Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed . Although the Macau problem was left unresolved , the ROC reclaimed numerous governing rights from the Portuguese , including powers over customs , coastal trade , and riverine transport ; also , Portuguese consular jurisdiction was terminated . The exhibit shows how the ROC tried to eliminate the unequal treaties .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
They offer intense plots and dialogue and always feature attractive leading men and women . The photo shows mainland actress Zhao Wei ( left ) , who became popular throughout the Chinese world after starring in a Chiung Yao series , pictured with former child star Su You-peng of Taiwan .

When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
In 1986 , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , who had already moved to America , came back to Taiwan to visit relatives . When I saw her graceful bearing as she left the airplane-saw how sharp and wise she was , and how bursting with vitality and determination-I realized that she was quite different from my earlier rendering of her .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
And now the tragedy at Pachang Creek , when millions of viewers saw four people swept to their deaths on live TV . Once again , the public is left feeling hurt and angry . And the question is raised : Are incompetence and inefficiency endemic within the structure of our bureaucracy ?  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
Like a compassionate bodhisattva , a pensive director who paces the corridors of history with head bowed uses the lens of his heart to lovingly reveal souls left trembling and abandoned by war , in the spaces where light and darkness overlap . In the mind of veteran Taiwanese-language film director Hsin Chi , the muffled voices of " men without a motherland " chant in repetitive chorus .  
They could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid . The stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay . But this decorative effect , thinks Cheng , was probably secondary to the functional purpose of compacting the clay .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
Western imperialism left a legacy of imbalance in the use of the world 's resources . Poorer nations , pressed by rapid population growth and the desire to develop , and lacking sufficient management or technical skills , usually rejected calls from the wealthy countries to put the environment first .  
For most of history , the limited powers of our unaided senses left humans blissfully unaware of the micro-organisms all around us . But the development of optical instruments gradually lifted the veil from that hidden world , so that human ideas about life had to be constantly revised .  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
Because the paper is impermeable , after the overall composition has been sketched out the artist applies layer after layer of expensive pigments-ground crystal , blue chalcedony , emerald green-with the gold base left uncovered to provide the linear sketch elements of the painting .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
During the war against Japan , Taiwanese Opera was prohibited on the mainland due to the fact that the land of its birth , Taiwan , was under Japanese colonial rule . Sai Yue-chin borrowed money left and right in order to flee to a rural inland area , where she performed on stage by night . The shows lasted until dawn , and the tough schedule brought on a serious gastric ailment for the frail Sai .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
Many of the rocks from mudslides in Chungliao have also been left to lie . People there are used to disaster , and to mud . Smoothing scars When pictures are beamed into every living room showing vivid scenes of jetliners striking skyscrapers , with black smoke billowing and people running for their lives , or of deadly mudslides and floods , it is hard not to be disturbed by them .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
This happened during a leadership class when O-Young left the trail and fell behind the group in order to photograph some beautiful mountain scenery . Trying to catch up , he did what he was accustomed to do in Taiwan : he took a shortcut . When he came out ahead of the instructor , he was feeling mighty pleased with himself , only to be rebuked by the entire team .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
The devastating earthquake two years ago-the biggest in 100 years-caused 70 of the village 's 156 residences to collapse , not to mention the 30-plus houses that were left partially crippled by the disaster . While fortunately only one individual received minor injuries , none of the public buildings , including Tannan Elementary , the police station , and the village 's Catholic church , were left unscathed-in fact , most were totally destroyed . Moreover , access to the outside world was completely severed for a week .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
By 1989 , when the Executive Yuan ordered a ban on further logging of natural forests , only isolated patches were left of the great swathe of 20 million gigantic yellow and red cypress trees that once stretched the length and breadth of Taiwan . The yellow cypresses of Mt . Chilan in Ilan County form one of the last remaining relatively untouched forests of giant trees in Taiwan .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
Trend expert John Naisbitt , in his High Tech , High Touch : Technology and Our Search for Meaning , discusses the threat posed to American youth by violent virtual reality games ( especially lifelike combat games ) , stating that they render children unable to distinguish between real and virtual . This in turn has generated a slew of on-campus firearms attacks that have left American society reeling .  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
Eventually , Min Sheng Daily agreed to add another gig , and the 2500 tickets for that were cleaned out in a single morning . After the event , the emcee , Chen Kai-lun , said that this was the most moving event he had ever hosted . There was not an empty seat to be found , no one left halfway through , and everyone felt as if they were being carried back in time on a genteel current of luxurious music .  
Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
Yu used to hold down multiple jobs that kept him racing every day between the hospital , television station , radio station , and newspaper . For years he woke up brutally early to do radio and TV shows , stumbling home dead beat well after sundown . He developed a gastrointestinal problem that often left him doubled over in pain without any advance warning .  
The first carriage struck the mountain , the second and third carriages were crushed and overturned , and the fourth carriage fell five meters into a ravine . The tragedy left 17 dead and over 170 injured .  
Under the bright sunlight , Tzu Chi volunteers stay busy , and as they work their dark blue shirts becoming soaked with sweat ; when the clothes dry , the salt marks left behind look like white lotus flowers that have just bloomed .  
While Lai was in Japan he pored over the ancient Records of Artisanry , pondering and experimenting continuously in an effort to resurrect the long lost technique . But for years he was frustrated . Then , serendipity struck in 1986 . While making a wood base , he mixed the thinner left over from the day before into his lacquer .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
Seventy-two year old Ting Tsai-po , Taiwan 's sole remaining salt worker of national treasure status , spent his entire life earning a living on the salt fields . He is the only one left who understands the salt channel system and how to repair and maintain it .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
In 1982 Wu learned of a school run by the Catholic Maryknoll Sisters that had been left empty when student numbers had fallen and was even flooded by a major typhoon . Located in a low-lying area , when a nearby river burst its banks the school was filled with all manner of dirt and river sludge and with no money for repairs was effectively abandoned for several years .  
In addition , in 1999 , after the streamlining of the provincial government , city and county chronic disease control offices either were merged with other agencies or discontinued their tuberculosis operations . Medical care for TB gradually shifted from specialist hospitals to regular health care institutions . Some of the highly trained tuberculosis specialists retired , while others left their jobs , or were assigned to other positions . The old TB prevention infrastructure today no longer exists .  
Wu had made separate molds for the orchids ' centers and five petals , so he invited an expert in " running water " welding to put them together . After six hours , the petals were only halfway assembled . The expert said that he really thought they should use traditional welding flux , but Wu Ching was determined and refused . After the expert left , Wu worked and studied for five hours before finally finishing one orchid .  
At the threshold of the modestly sized temple are a pair of lions carved from a single slab of stone-female on the right , male on the left . The male is playing with a ball , while the female is supporting a cub . The carving of the hard stone is exquisite .  
Thinly executed decorative elements on the god 's head , left shoulder , and left leg show the patterns on his headgear and armor and hint at time standing still . In the meantime , the clothing and beard are swept back in evidence of quick motion . Wu hit upon a way to convey this sense of motion while watching martial characters bound about the stage in Peking Opera to the accompaniment of drums and cymbals .  
Of particular importance was the fact that although the hydroelectric plant was to be donated gratis to the local community , the community would then be responsible for all future management and upkeep . This was deemed the only way to ensure sustainable operation and prevent the facility falling into disrepair for lack of maintenance as soon as the aid team left .  
The low temperatures make it tough for the workers to go on but if a typhoon should strike the high mountains , with their ubiquitous steep cliffs , the men are petrified . In 2003 Huang Chao-ying won the contracts to rebuild the Hsuehpei and Sumita shelters , located along the Shengleng trail . Work began at the end of August and in September two typhoons hit .

The opera Hua Mu-lan , about a legendary woman warrior , was scheduled next , and with no one to be found for the lead role , the lively and nimble Wang Hai-ling , who was skilled at both singing and kungfu parts , was picked to fill in .  
Hsu Kuo-chiang left his Szechuan home at thirteen , and spent half a century serving at the level of a common soldier . Five years ago he entered a veterans ' home , accustomed to life alone .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
When he learned who had written it , he tried to visit Hsu whenever he came to Hsin An , but he never succeeded in seeing him . Li Po once left a poem behind on the wall of his hut : Having copied and recited your poems , I 've come to visit the immortal 's dwelling . But your traces are lost in the misty peaks , where cloudy forests part the primal void .  
She looked at the children in front of her . In the middle was one dressed in a white suit ; on the left a little one wearing a lace frilly skirt with a pattern of little flowers with a peach red sweater ; and on the right one with bright yellow sweats , with an adorable Mickey Mouse on the front .  
During the cold winter season it lost all its leaves , and only barren branches are left to wait for the spring . As I watch them , the withered branches seem especially strong and unyielding in the dark . Some of the branches bud early and are soon covered with tender green leaves , transparent , smooth and clean . The veins on each heart-shaped leaf are clear to the scrutiny of night .  
The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them . During the seventeenth century the aborigines still lived by hunting and fishing , and the Han Chinese immigrants were mostly poor farmers and fishermen who left no written records behind , while the historical documents of the Cheng clan ( descendants of the Ming loyalist Koxinga ) were destroyed during the Ching dynasty .  
From transient visitors who left their hometowns for a temporary stay there , they have made themselves into the sector of the populace with the most economic clout on the island , but owing to special historical and geographical factors , they have been unable to shake off the psychology of transience .  
But in fact the supposed tradition stretched back no further : my teachers ' teachers , many of them scholars of foreign origin , were the generation that had established Chinese studies in Britain on a professional footing . They had to learn a lot more by themselves and it was hard to find a good teacher , J . K . Fairbank reveals that when he arrived at Oxford in the 1930s , eager to learn Chinese , Soothill left him to fend for himself .  
Especially after the end of the Second World War , which left the country , like the U . S . , relatively unscathed , its strong economy , which ranked among the world 's top , and its abundant capital at the time laid a good foundation for the development of its universities and academic research .  
Going south along Hsin Sheng South Road past Hsin Yi Road , you pass the Chin Hua Girls ' Senior High and Taipei Mosque on the right , and on the left stretches the zone designated for the No . 7 municipal park . Here stands a row of car repair garages which , once they close down after dark , turn into a deserted oasis of darkness long familiar to Taipei residents .  
That he could return to his homeland was naturally some consolation to him in his final years , but it is still a pity that Eight Virtues Garden lost its owner and was expropriated so soon . The remaining rocks and trees were sold or stolen ; the gibbons and other rare animals were sent to the Sao Paolo zoo ; and Great Wind Hall was left ankle deep in exquisite Chinese paper and scrolls .  
In his view , housing belongs to the infrastructure and can not easily be altered once built , whereas cultural and educational work can be developed and improved through mistakes , and is a long term project that can not be left undone .  
So prudent parents ship their kid off early to one of the numerous cram schools around the city , to a " supplemental class for the exceptionally gifted , " " children 's potential enhancement center " or " simultaneous development course for the left and right sides of the brain . "  
Along the path , the " Eight Family Generals , " with colorfully painted faces , straw shoes , and with the implements of worship in hand , are responsible for sweeping away evil and demons and protecting the divine entourage . The Centipede chen and the Golden Lion chen , with similarly divine capabilities , take the left and right points , clearing a path for Wang Tieh . As noon approaches , the hot sun pounds on the processionists .  
At the sound of the drum , the groom heaps into the air , does a leg split , and comes down sitting firmly on the ground . The drumming comes to an abrupt halt , and all you can hear in the frozen air is the sound of the groom breathing . Members of the troupe rush over to pull off the groom 's left stilt .  
When the decision of where to put the railroad station is finally settled at the end of September , " the bear market will certainly appear , " says Tsai Cheng-lin . It seems just like a balloon carried high by the wind only to be left stuck in mid-air when the breeze slackens , then briefly buffeted before the inevitable descent ; what is so strange is that property prices can be this fragile - - tossed around so easily by the hot air of groundless rumors . (  
Splendid at sunset , the grand old city evokes the bygone days of the Portuguese , the Dutch and the British , who each came , ruled the city in turn and left behind buildings in their characteristic architectural styles . Combined with the mosques of the native Malaysians and the quaint temples and alleyways of the immigrant Chinese , they all go to make up the old city 's distinctive tapestry .  
We rested on a platform that seemed to overlook the whole planet . The settlement was visible far away at the mountain 's foot , girdled by a white stream flowing in a bow-shape to its left before meandering off into the west to shake hands with a row of low clouds .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
On the software side , going into a modern theater meant the plot had to be tight and polished , not like the traditional outdoor stage with just a broad idea and the content left to the actors ' emotions to elaborate .  
When the market took off , he invited his friends out to celebrate , going to luxurious piano bars , and tossing around NT $ 1000 bills without a second glance . Unfortunately , the stock market later suffered repeated setbacks . Who knows where that NT $ 600,000 loan went ? All that 's left now is the monthly payment of principal and interest of six or seven thousand NT dollars , and the day when it will all be paid off seems to be in the very remote future . . . .  
In the conservative period of martial law , not only was the showing of violent films illegal , it was also not legal to publicly show most classic films because their " excessive sexuality is not fit for the national situation " or because they were considered politically sensitive . This left most classic film lovers no place to turn .  
Having seen his friend die with his own eyes , Chiang was grief stricken , but that very afternoon he still had to fly over the presidential offices and form a perfect " 60 " in the blue sky to celebrate the country 's 60th anniversary . Parting for life is hard : Pilots understand the danger of their work and have learned to accept the misfortune of others . But it is hard for loved ones that have been left behind .  
Chinese ho-yuan could be connected together or divided up , " he explains . After a large family subdivides and each member forms his own family , one need only close the side doors of the rooms ; the main compound and the hulung , or auxiliary rooms set off to the left and right of the main com pound ( separated by an open-air pathway ) , can then become two independent bodies .  
Then there was the outbreak of a disease that left people with blackened feet in the coastal area of southern Chiayi which has been proved by experts on contagious diseases to have been related to the protracted use of underground water containing too much arsenic for drinking . "  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
Around six months later comes Double Ninth , which falls on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month . Scholars believe that ascending a height is a custom left over from prehistoric times , when people climbed hills to escape floods . The tradition arose during the Han Dynasty that " double nine " was an unlucky day liable to disaster , and the literati of later dynasties would climb a height and wax lyrical on the passing seasons .  
But because those who have left find themselves in a strange environment and often adapt poorly , this creates even greater pressures . Forty-nine-year-old Chiu Chin-shih , who has spent half his life on the plain studying , living , and working , uses his own experience as an example : If an aborigine is competing with someone else for a job , unless one is extremely outstanding and the only one qualified , if it 's a situation where only one guy is going to get hired , they wo n't take the aborigine .  
The earliest flower and bird paintings had excellent colors and beautifully delicate and detailed brush work , as can be seen in the work of the court painter Huang Chuan of the Western Hsu in the period of the Five Dynasties . The album he left for his son is just like today 's illustrations with the subjects scattered on the paper with no apparent relationship , as though waiting to supply people with information .  
Such is the case with the banyan , the timber of which is easily distorted ; the Formosan sweet gum , which people do not like to cut because it bleeds red sap ; and the autumn maple tree with its knotty trunk . Together , these make up more than half the old trees presently listed by the D . A . F . Thanks to the temples many old trees are left standing .  
But when you look a little closer , the slightly bent back , the thinning hair , and the fingers , misshapen and arthritic from overwork , all unintentionally reveal the marks left on him by long and arduous effort and by the passage of time . God 's will : Thirty-two years . The time this foreign doctor has spent in Taiwan just happens to be same as that spent in his native land . "  
" The lonely eagle : " An eagle is circling / The wind along the high ridge inspiring its wings / Those days just before you left / You seemed evasive , restless / So like a gaunt eagle anxious to fly / . . . " - Chen Yi-chih . Accompanying human history over thousands of years , the birds of prey have never been tamed . Their genes know no code for " obedience " or " companionship . "  
Lu Nianhua , owner of the Ruby Chinese Restaurant in Paris , left Mainland China and went to work in France at the age of twenty , and only three years later became a restaurant owner . But he says that he did n't have any special secret at all for getting rich quick - - it was all thanks to Wenzhou people 's " magic flute " for whistling up mutual prosperity : the " monthly club . "  
When you get to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial in Taipei , you see a gaggle of men dressed up as " old grandmas . " Their faces are painted with rouge , and they wear skirts splashed with red and green . They carry fans in their left hands and parasols in their right . The gaudy makeup attracts a great number of curious people who want to have commemorative photos taken .  
Bob Yeh , managing director of the Meta Advertising Company , which handles the account for Shin Shii oolong tea , analyzes the reasons for failure at that time : First , Chinese who had long been accustomed to taking their tea hot could not immediately accept cold tea . There was a traditional belief that " tea left overnight produces poisons . " If tea is left to steep for a long time , it creates tannic acid , which causes the arteries to contract and makes digestion difficult .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
It 's just too bad that 12 years ago when the entire village moved down to the plains , their old village was left abandoned , its streets and gardens weed choked and its stone walls toppled .  
Some calculating employees could tell that my husband was n't completely in support of me . To my surprise , they conspired to make my standing worse . Sometimes in public with a lot of people around , my husband scolded me , and after he left the room the employees treated my with a cold , haughty air .  
I really feel that this is unfair to the workers of the Water Conservancy Bureau . I am also greatly concerned that no scenic places will be left for our future generations . I implore the various relevant agencies to do away with their own opinions , to put aside egotistical , improper behavior , and to think more of the generations to come !  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
The changing face of Hakka womenIn recent years there has been a massive outflow of population from Hakka villages . Most young people have left to pursue their studies or careers . Even for those left behind , traditional Hakka values are fading in young people because of increased education , the impact of the mass media , and multifarious interactions with other ethnic groups .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
Once I helped people pass out leaflets , but my boss got mad at me because I was slow , and I left . I went to a boxed lunch shop and helped them carry the boxed lunches , but it was too tiring . After a week , I did n't go back . Then I worked at my brother 's friend 's travel agency answering phones for two months .  
And so in 1901 , when the Governor-General 's Residence was completed ( now the Taipei Guest House ) , it was luxuriously expansive and well appointed . The Japanese craftsmen designed the space imitating the baroque style in order to show their noble authority . Widening Tungmen Street , which originally led through the East Gate , they left the Gate as the center of a traffic circle , so as to make it convenient for military parades as well as every-day horses and carriages . Full of traffic , the road was very impressive .  
In an extreme example of the principle of natural selection , only the strongest could survive the journey home , thus maintaining the durability and health of the whole species . However , when the ice receded , many brook masu salmon were left stranded , unable to return to the sea . They had no choice but to become " landlocked " salmon .  
Previously salmon had taken advantage of different types of topography to adapt to natural disasters . Today there are no pools for them to escape to , and when heavy rains come the fish are washed downstream . No fish , no matter how strong , can overcome the meters-high dams to get back upstream , so they are left to die from the higher water temperatures downstream .  
Those amazing Chinese parents " All things are beneath contempt , only education is to be esteemed . " " Only if you suffer can you surpass others . " The ancient sages have left many a pithy phrase to inspire us to greater heights . They articulate the line of thinking in Chinese culture which argues that learning is the only path to respectable success .  
Today 's society is even more complex , and the powers ascribed to the tiger have also become more diverse . As people 's understanding of nature has increased , the tiger has lost its mystique , and with so few tigers left there is no longer any likelihood of people finding themselves in a face-to-face struggle with a tiger . Thus people are free to develop their own human perspective and let the tiger symbolize whatever they want it to .  
When speaking of the photography process , Chen remarks that in the beginning she was extremely precise and painstaking about the style of photography , and she discussed it with the photo company 's service lady for a long time . She even filled out a lengthy questionnaire . " Finally , " says Chen Mei-ling , " the photographer arrived , and before we exchanged two sentences , he wrote down the words ' Dignified and demure . ' " The results left her feeling disappointed .  
In the painting " Spring Thunder , " with the damp cold of its steely grey color scheme , a white flash of lightning steaks out from the left , while amid gusts of rain , plants bend rightward in the direction of the lightning .  
If you walk on beyond the Mother Temple 's main entrance , you might notice that most of the edifices are inscribed with the donors ' names . Stepping up 323 stone steps , and looking up , you 'll see the towering gate constructed on behalf of Tachia 's Chenlan Temple . After passing through the main square , you 'll find that the bell and drum pavilions situated on the left and right are dedicated by two business people , a brother and sister from Taiwan surnamed Chen .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
The notion of female chastity began to be reinforced . Previously it had been common for widows to remarry , but from the Song onwards remarriage was seen as " unchaste , " and was not tolerated by the society of the time . Stories such as " The widow cutting off her arm " ( after it had been accidentally touched by a man ) and " An injured breast left untreated " ( because exposure to the doctor 's gaze would have been worse than death ) were taken as models and ideals and widely promoted .  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
One scientific theory is that in this state the right hemisphere of the brain , which controls imagination , memory , creativity , and sensibility , is active , whereas the left hemisphere of the brain , which controls analytical thought , value judgments , and logical thinking , is suppressed . Someone who is hypnotized enters a trance-like state controlled by the right hemisphere .  
The occasion is a lively one , with the sounds of accompanying husbands and babies mingling in with the Indonesian chatter of the brides . 37-year-old Ah Chuan , a farmer , left off the booze this morning and is sitting dutifully at the back of the classroom , accompanying his heavily pregnant wife Liu Sai-chu . " A lot of us have married Indonesians in the last couple of years , " he says , cracking a crude grin .  
Off to the right , light green squares are inlaid amidst dark verdant patches of mango trees and sparkling streams running through gorges . This is where we plan to land . Off to the left , the little spot of white amidst the puffs of smoke and dense green is Saichia Village . When you lift your gaze to the horizon , your field of vision takes in Kaoshu , Chishan , and Pingtung .  
For instance , irregular meal times have given him digestion problems ; he has hemorrhoids from long hours in the driver 's seat ; driving with the windows closed and the air conditioning on to keep out the polluted air gives him aching joints ; watching the road and traffic signals all day tires his eyes and makes his vision blurry ; using the clutch constantly in stop-go traffic leaves his left leg painful and weak , and so on .  
Contrary to the common impression that expatriates have little contact with their native land , more than 80% of the respondents had been back in Taiwan within the past three years . More than half had been in Taiwan within the previous year . This suggests that they have maintained close ties with Taiwan . In terms of provincial origin , a plurality of our respondents - - more than 40% - - were second generation mainlanders ( that is , children of fathers who left mainland China before 1949 ) .  
Take , for instance , Lai Ho , the father of Taiwan 's new literature , who started his career writing classical poems . In old age , when he was very ill , he wrote " The Setting Sun " about Japanese imperialism in its final moments : " The sun 's slanting rays yellow as west it creeps / For what place has brilliance left so soon ? / How short men 's torment in the bitter heat / Behind them rises the waxing eastern moon . "  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Yet , however minute the design may get , there can not be any shortcomings , or the result will be great controversy . The stamp commemorating the DGP 's 90th anniversary featured an airplane with the ROC flag on the tail . The designer depicted the plane as seen from its left side . Faithful to reality , he placed the white sun symbol of the ROC flag in the upper right-hand corner of the flag ( it is ordinarily in the upper left hand corner ) .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
The Chinese have always sought stability and order , and they make a big deal about how their residences and tombs are oriented . " With a dragon on the left and tiger on the right to ward off bad luck and with a rose finch and a black soldier to regulate the Yin and Yang , " it was believed , " children and grandchildren will surround you and your ancestors will be happy and prosperous . "  
Not far from the coast can be found a spirit temple , built at the site of some old graves . Unaware of the true origins of the dead , some Han Chinese sought to placate the ghosts they feared were left unattended and lonely . A few years ago , when the Liuhecai numbers game swept over all of Taiwan , the temple was particularly dense with the smoke of joss sticks .  
When a full scoop tilted down and struck the trip lever , a connecting rod joined to the trip lever pulled sharply downwards on the weighted end of the upper balance lever . This raised the opposite end of the lever , jerking open the left upper lock , which was joined to it by another connecting rod . This released the drive wheel , allowing it to turn due to the imbalance between the empty scoops on one side and the full scoops on the other .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
At that time , yew wood was not considered suitable for making utensils . The only thing it was thought fit for was to be burnt to make charcoal . But big yews left standing in the forests were put to another use : with their well-developed root systems , they could be used as anchoring points when moving timber : steel cables would be run around them to haul together the logs from felled trees .  
The correct way to treat the dying person before the conscious soul has left the body is to keep the room quiet , and not perform the above actions on the patient , so as to keep the soul peaceful and safe .  
As the end approaches it is best if the patient can lie in the auspicious position with their head to the north and their face to the west , but this should not be forced , and after breathing stops they should be left to lie naturally , and not moved .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
Upon entering the clean room , you see large machines in a row : The " ion implant machine " lays a membrane on the chip . Then , in a process called photolithography , the circuit design is projected onto the surface using glass " photomasks . " Then the chip goes into the " etch " process , where areas of excess metal ( i.e . metal which is outside the design projected on to the chip ) are chemically eroded away . What is left is are rows of oblong dies .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
Among constitutional disputes , while the proposal to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Government ( TPG ) was placed only on the second day of the agenda , it gained even more attention than reforming the central level system . Dissent was found , however , not among the three parties , but in the " provincial " representatives directly involved . Governor James Soong , elected by popular vote , was left in the most embarrassing position . He skipped the debate by pleading that they had to answer interpellations from provincial assemblymen .  
They have great vitality and are adapted to hostile conditions . The pine seeds grow wherever they fall : in cracks in rocks , on precipices . Thus they appear in tenacious postures , even clinging crazily to sheer crags . In late Autumn , when other trees have shed their leaves and the flowers have all withered , often all that is left is the " lone pine on a winter ridge . "  
Two years ago on Women 's Day , several hundred wives , mothers and grandmothers left their homes and their kitchens to take to the streets . They carried with them a revised copy of the Family Law provisions of the civil code which they delivered to the Legislative Yuan . They were rejecting having their praises sung yet again as " all-sacrificing model women , " and instead were representing the rights and interests of " three million injured Taiwanese women crying in the dark . "  
The civil code guarantees that the husband will manage , use , and receive the earnings from property . A divorced woman may win custody of her children , but with laws on the division of property incomplete , if her husband is something less than generous and tries to make things difficult for her , she may be left caring for her children without a penny to her name . In principle , the legal code is for " people " ; there should not be any distinctions made on the basis of sex .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
This was the most chaotic page in Hong Kong history . While it seems like the major cause was friction between capital and labor , in fact , this was a general explosion of accumulated resentment against problems left to fester under the colonial government , such as harsh working conditions , and the growing gap between rich and poor .  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
Born and raised in Kaohsiung , Chen left his home for a decade , coming to Taipei to attend university and graduate school and to work . He moved back to Kaohsiung only in 1993 , and only then did he discover how much his old hometown had changed . To refamiliarize himself with the old stomping grounds , he signed up to be a guide with the Takao Hill Association . " The more I came to understand it , the more I treasured this piece of earth .  
According to his study of the subject , the patterns on Damascus swords are the natural crystal patterns formed when steel is cast , and those on Japanese swords are lines of temper color left by partial quenching of the blades . But the patterns on Chinese hundred-beaten steel are the grain patterns which result from repeated folding and hammering of the metal .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
What one sees is what is left after the violence , circles of shards amid the silence . With Tsong Pu 's exquisite and mature installation technique , the small and large pottery shards arranged in their disordered way create a rhythm between strong and weak and rising and falling that is similar to what is found in poetry .  
Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark . It sealed off the old residence with plywood boards and closed up the flower garden . All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "  
This building , which is located on Taipei 's Chungshan North Road , was built in 1901 . In the period of Japanese colonial rule it was the US Consulate . After the US and ROC broke off diplomatic relations it was left unattended and after almost two decades of neglect it was in a parlous state , with trees growing through the walls and holes in the roof .  
Modern radio people are a diverse group : senior broadcaster Luo Hsiao-yun often hosts press conferences for pop stars ( top left ) ; Su Lai , who was originally a pop star himself , likes radio work because he gets to play music and talk about his emotions ( bottom left ) ; Li Ming-jou , a hot young radio show host , makes a commercial endorsement ( above ) .  
In the Palace Museum in Beijing , there is a painting entitled Listening to the Qin , by Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty . In it , a brown-robed Daoist sits playing a qin under a pine tree . To left and right are " Two quietly musing guests , one with head raised , one with head bowed / To hear that stringless playing . " In the center of the picture , on a strangely shaped stone which serves as a pedestal , stands an elegant potted plant .  
There are but few aboriginals left living in their tribal villages and living by hunting alone ; at best , hunting is a sideline . Like other aboriginal peoples , the Rukai of Wutai are leaving behind traditional life . But , comparatively speaking , Wutai remains less disrupted . Being in remote southern Taiwan , and as yet without intrusion by major roads , there are few outsiders , and the simple village life is relatively intact .  
After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township . Also , because of forbidding topography or traditional taboos , some untouched areas were left between the hunting grounds . This fits right in with theories of effective management of natural resources .  
Reflecting their age or even leading it , advertisements expand our scope of vision . Metaphysical Punctuality 's " New , New Youth in China " series won the China Times ' top prize for television commercials in 1993 ( left ) . This year , the winner for print media advertising design was Ideology 's " Little Red Riding Hood " series . Its main theme is modern women 's quest for self-fulfillment and physical safety . ( opposite page photo courtesy of Metaphysical Punctuality Company , left photo courtesy of Ideology Company )  
Having been left without parents when a child , Fang-liang was always the caring mother . Her husband was a strict father in the traditional mold . He would beat the children when they did something wrong , to the sound of Fang-liang imploring him to stop in her Ningbo dialect .  
Yet he was also left with a deep impression of Fang-liang as happy and lively , hospitable , talkative , and sociable . Chiang Ching-kuo 's attitude towards her was one of extreme closeness , and he was full of love and respect for her , leaving her the true master of the house .  
Some years ago , Mai Jan-mei was director of guidance at another Taipei middle school , located in one of the city 's most infamous criminal areas . At that time some pupils formed a gang and began causing trouble . They padded their left shoulders up high and went around the school terrorizing the other children ; even teachers did n't dare mess with them .  
When World War II broke out and the major dance companies of Europe stopped operating , Ishii Midori and Ishii Baku left for Southeast Asia on a tour of Burma , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore . Tsai Jui-yueh , learning modern Western dance techniques and concepts all the while , went with them . The trip gave her invaluable performing experience but even more importantly expanded her dance horizons , allowing her to absorb the dance styles of various nations .  
Those who " set out with great hopes only to return defeated " were left both angry and disappointed . As one person who works in the media noted , in metropolitan Taipei , " The leisure industry was pushing its leisure facilities down people 's throats all day long . Media packaging made for holiday crowds of historic dimensions on government-sponsored educational package tours and at private amusement parks , new department stores and even the Hollywood-transplanted Warner Village movie theater complex . "  
When the Kaohsiung Museum of Science opened last year , it experienced disaster in the form of crowds which damaged exhibits . After staff had cleaned up , the museum hired a large number of temporary personnel and brought in additional volunteers to help see it through the Lunar New Year 's holidays . But the nightmare repeated itself , and many volunteers were left scrubbing betelnut juice from the floors after the museum closed .  
But sadly life is an inescapable obligation , and King Mu had not finished his duties here below . As he left , the Queen Mother 's parting words to him were : " Though the peaks stand as high as the clouds , you crossed mountains and rivers to come from the distant east ; may you live to be a hundred , and may we meet again . "  
Although in the minds of the ancients fairylands were extensions of the real world , the more distant and unattainable they were , the more scope they left for the imagination . The island of Penglai was hazy and indistinct , and the mountains of Kunlun vague and remote .  
Consequently , in modern times few bona fide doctors of traditional Chinese medicine have been carrying out research on the specific-and what they regard as merely symptomatic-problem of impaired sexual function . Yet this absence of research has given rise to all manner of bizarre folk prescriptions and quack nostrums aimed at combating impotency . Users are left to determine for themselves whether any of these remedies actually works or if they have noxious side effects .  
If the star is successful , the program pays for the person 's desired prize ; otherwise , the person 's hope is left unrealized . The format of this segment resembles the old show Loving Heart , which encouraged people to help some unfortunate . But the new program has an even more direct emotional appeal insofar as it cuts in live shots of the reactions of the hosts and audience members , sometimes zooming in on the superstar celebrities as they weep .  
Each time , this man who had said he just wanted to go peacefully was yanked back from the brink of death by his doctors . He received more than a thousand heart stimulant injections , for which a long and sharp needle must pierce the heart itself . The extreme pressure from the CPR which he received on numerous occasions had left several of his ribs broken . And his skin had turned black , burned by the repeated electrical charges . . . .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation . He points out that in the past the education system was conservative . Sex was considered to be dirty and vulgar , not worthy of the halls of knowledge . Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Taiwan 's estuarine shellfish live on plankton and organic matter , and heavy metals accumulate in their bodies ; the fleshy parts such as the foot and adductor muscle can still be eaten , but the central viscera are best left alone . " Even the ' best ' seafood today is n't fit to eat , " writes Lin Ming-yu , a reporter with the Min Sheng Pao newspaper , lamenting the difficulty of finding good seafood in Taiwan .  
After years of research on " split-brain " epileptics ( epileptics whose corpus collosum-a neural structure linking the two sides of the brain-has been cut to limit seizures to one side of their brain ) , Sperry discovered that the left brain is responsible for language , logical thinking and analysis . The right brain , on the other hand , seems to be involved with images , imagination and intuition .  
Another factor was that in the wake of Pearl Harbor , there were only limited numbers of fit , potential conscripts left in Japan , and with the expansion of the Japanese lines from the Pacific to Southeast Asia , the tough , hardworking aboriginal youths , with their knack for fighting in forested mountain terrain , naturally became a priority consideration .  
" The three main stations are too constrained in their political coverage , " he explains . In 1994 , when the political scientist Peng Ming-min returned from three decades of exile abroad ( he had fled after calling for Taiwanese independence ) , Hsiao returned from his interview with Peng at CKS International Airport to find that his piece had to be approved by three different levels of management before being aired . The experience left him feeling that this was far from the ideal of press freedom .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
These unfamiliar strangers from the distant past left everyone speechless . Day and night , the archeologists dug feverishly for more ancient relics . About a month after the discovery of pit # 1 , another brick worker came running with the news that he had dug up two more heads some 30 meters away . He remarked , " The eyebrows are blue , and the lips are red . "  
That 's when he left behind the fingerprints . " It was these fingerprints that enabled the police to crack the case . The uncanny ability of the police to solve difficult cases has led some to quip that investigators have a crystal ball in their possession . To be sure , forensic science makes the crystal ball work better , but the crystal ball itself is something else entirely-the careful reasoning of seasoned investigators .  
" In the past , the scrap left behind in Wanli had little recycling value , so it was simply burnt , " says Tony Kang , an assistant manager at Taiwan May Chia Metal Company ( TMCM ) . But the mixed electronics wastes such as printed circuit boards which make up the bulk of electrical scrap today contain many valuable heavy metals which can be recovered and sold after intermediate processes such as sorting and smelting .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
An elderly gent named Chang , who left Taiwan 20 years ago and returned a couple of years ago , is amazed when he sees cartoons lampooning national leaders or when radio commentators say national figures ' " brains are on the fritz . " Is this is the same country that he left all those years ago because of its suffocating and oppressive atmosphere ?  
He continues : " Actually he was talking about things on the spiritual plane , but who 'd have thought that so soon afterwards Puli would be left in such an appalling state by an earthquake , as if it really was sunk . So we all joked that he has ' second sight . ' " " In fact he had been extremely despondent , and that 's why he was eager to turn from mere thinking and observation to action , by doing some concrete community work .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
On the evening of October 22 , the late autumn air of Taipei was just a little chilly , but the plaza in front of the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall was hot and teeming with people . More than 10,000 music fans were crowded together , some sitting , some standing , all waiting for the concert " Nature and Hope : A Voyage to Paradise . " The show was a benefit concert for the Eden Foundation , to help those who were left physically handicapped by the Sept . 21 earthquake .  
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants . Everything seemed smooth and orderly . But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .  
In 1928 , the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking was terminated , and a new Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed . Although the Macau problem was left unresolved , the ROC reclaimed numerous governing rights from the Portuguese , including powers over customs , coastal trade , and riverine transport ; also , Portuguese consular jurisdiction was terminated . The exhibit shows how the ROC tried to eliminate the unequal treaties .  
Letting Them Go gathers together ten moving short stories which take as their theme the plight of the elderly in rural communities . The stories respond to the changing circumstances in Taiwan 's countryside , such as the departure of young people for the cities and growing industrial pollution . Speaking in this interview , Huang explicitly stated his purpose in this collection : " I want to bear witness to the plight of the senior citizens left behind in rural communities . "  
They offer intense plots and dialogue and always feature attractive leading men and women . The photo shows mainland actress Zhao Wei ( left ) , who became popular throughout the Chinese world after starring in a Chiung Yao series , pictured with former child star Su You-peng of Taiwan .

When Tiway Sayion retired from his position as principal of Hualien 's Tafalong Primary School after a teaching career that spanned 45 years , his first act was to realize a long-cherished dream-he returned to the tribal community where he was born and built a cabin in which to live . Tiway Sayion 's simple 20-ping cabin is laid out with the kitchen and bathroom on the right and the bedroom on the left . The center is his living room , furnished with only a sofa and bookshelves .  
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 . When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal . I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by . I have to hurry up and get the book written . "  
What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position . But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
In 1986 , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , who had already moved to America , came back to Taiwan to visit relatives . When I saw her graceful bearing as she left the airplane-saw how sharp and wise she was , and how bursting with vitality and determination-I realized that she was quite different from my earlier rendering of her .  
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten . Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out . Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .  
It all began eight years ago at a friend 's home , where Chen and his wife saw a statue of the Buddha dating back to the Northern Qi dynasty ( mid-6th century ) . Although neither of the two are Buddhists , they were captivated by the simple serenity of the statue . Concerned by the fact that war and chaos in China have left many of the country 's ancient Buddhist statues scattered across the globe , Chen decided to do his part to recover what he could from abroad .  
At a symposium on Buddhist music held earlier this year at Fokuangshan , a center for Buddhist studies and worship , several Buddhist academics voiced concern about the popularization and commercialization of the form , and its loss of sacramental character . As they pointed out : take away the title and the chanting , and you 're left with pure pop .  
And now the tragedy at Pachang Creek , when millions of viewers saw four people swept to their deaths on live TV . Once again , the public is left feeling hurt and angry . And the question is raised : Are incompetence and inefficiency endemic within the structure of our bureaucracy ?  
For example Master Hui Neng , despite being illiterate , was known for his skill at literary discussion and the composition of religious verse . It was Hui Neng who left his cassock on a rock atop Dayu Ridge , from where the monk who was following him was unable to move it . The external actions of those who had attained enlightenment often strayed into the realm of what for normal people would be " miracles . "  
Like a compassionate bodhisattva , a pensive director who paces the corridors of history with head bowed uses the lens of his heart to lovingly reveal souls left trembling and abandoned by war , in the spaces where light and darkness overlap . In the mind of veteran Taiwanese-language film director Hsin Chi , the muffled voices of " men without a motherland " chant in repetitive chorus .  
They could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid . The stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay . But this decorative effect , thinks Cheng , was probably secondary to the functional purpose of compacting the clay .  
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest . In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .  
Western imperialism left a legacy of imbalance in the use of the world 's resources . Poorer nations , pressed by rapid population growth and the desire to develop , and lacking sufficient management or technical skills , usually rejected calls from the wealthy countries to put the environment first .  
For most of history , the limited powers of our unaided senses left humans blissfully unaware of the micro-organisms all around us . But the development of optical instruments gradually lifted the veil from that hidden world , so that human ideas about life had to be constantly revised .  
Elsewhere in the ROC the traditional Han Chinese culture was southern Fujianese . Meanwhile , eastern Fujian itself has experienced such rapid develpment that almost all of its traditional architecture has been destroyed . The traditional eastern Fujianese settlements on Matsu are just about the only ones left in pristine condition anywhere in the world .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
Because the paper is impermeable , after the overall composition has been sketched out the artist applies layer after layer of expensive pigments-ground crystal , blue chalcedony , emerald green-with the gold base left uncovered to provide the linear sketch elements of the painting .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
9-11 has left us at the brink of war , but the possibility of military conflict as a result of US retaliation is not the only worry . A fluke incident and a single leader 's misjudgment in many other flashpoints worldwide could push us beyond the point of no return . The historic enmity between Israel and Palestine comes to mind , as do the ethnic and religious killing in Eastern Europe . North and South Korea are another cause for concern .  
During the war against Japan , Taiwanese Opera was prohibited on the mainland due to the fact that the land of its birth , Taiwan , was under Japanese colonial rule . Sai Yue-chin borrowed money left and right in order to flee to a rural inland area , where she performed on stage by night . The shows lasted until dawn , and the tough schedule brought on a serious gastric ailment for the frail Sai .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
" Industrial firms in Taiwan have expanded capacity furiously over the past decade and produced in huge quantities . The result has been destructive price competition that has left producers badly weakened . " Central banks throughout the world have responded by lowering interest rates in an attempt to revive their economies . The US Federal Reserve Board has lowered the prime lending rate ten times this year , and Japan 's interest rates have been at zero for a long time , but rapidly declining investments have greatly reduced the effectiveness of such monetary measures .  
Many of the rocks from mudslides in Chungliao have also been left to lie . People there are used to disaster , and to mud . Smoothing scars When pictures are beamed into every living room showing vivid scenes of jetliners striking skyscrapers , with black smoke billowing and people running for their lives , or of deadly mudslides and floods , it is hard not to be disturbed by them .  
" Huashan lies at the juncture of the Philippine tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate . After serious earthquakes , the crust is loosened and altered , and the topography shows very obvious changes , " says Chiu Tsun-lung , director of the " Lake Bottom Culture Association , " and now a member of the 921 community reconstruction committee . He says that Huashan also has a rich cultural atmosphere . The historic artifacts left behind by pioneers combined with the natural environment provide valuable resources for " mountain education " in Taiwan .  
This happened during a leadership class when O-Young left the trail and fell behind the group in order to photograph some beautiful mountain scenery . Trying to catch up , he did what he was accustomed to do in Taiwan : he took a shortcut . When he came out ahead of the instructor , he was feeling mighty pleased with himself , only to be rebuked by the entire team .  
From the 1970s to the beginning of 1990s , entrance to these schools was fixed at a ratio of 30:70 . No matter how strong the desire of students to continue toward university , seven out of every ten were forced out of the university track and into the vocational track right after leaving junior high ( i.e . just before their tenth year in school ) . These have been the real victims left on the school advancement battlefield .  
With the current staffing structure in junior high schools , physics and chemistry teachers are not equipped to cross over and teach biology , and biology teachers can not teach information technology . Thus teaching in a single study field may be split between five different teachers , and pupils may be left to guess from the content of each unit which teacher will appear on any particular day . What kind of uncertainty will that introduce into the pupil-teacher relationship ?  
The devastating earthquake two years ago-the biggest in 100 years-caused 70 of the village 's 156 residences to collapse , not to mention the 30-plus houses that were left partially crippled by the disaster . While fortunately only one individual received minor injuries , none of the public buildings , including Tannan Elementary , the police station , and the village 's Catholic church , were left unscathed-in fact , most were totally destroyed . Moreover , access to the outside world was completely severed for a week .  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
About 25 or 30 kilometers west-northwest of the summit of Mt . Fuji , in central Japan 's Yamanashi Prefecture , lies the town of Nakatomi-cho , often called " the hometown of traditional Japanese paper . As in so many other small towns located far from Japan 's major urban centers , the people of Nakatomi-cho have found that remaining economically viable seems to have become something of an uphill proposition in the last few decades , as young job seekers have left for Tokyo and other big cities .  
Because there are so many wonderful uses for sensors , the National Science Council listed them as a scientific and technological focal point more than 10 years ago , and the ITRI started to research and develop them . Unfortunately , at that time most investors were focused on the stock and real estate markets , and the hot electronics sector swept away all investment capital . This left no money whatsoever for unfashionable fields such as sensors .  
By 1989 , when the Executive Yuan ordered a ban on further logging of natural forests , only isolated patches were left of the great swathe of 20 million gigantic yellow and red cypress trees that once stretched the length and breadth of Taiwan . The yellow cypresses of Mt . Chilan in Ilan County form one of the last remaining relatively untouched forests of giant trees in Taiwan .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
That very night he departed from the world without a warning or farewell . His passage was free and easy , but those whom he left behind were reluctant to let go . Liu 's biographer Yang Meng-yu once asked Liu whether he worried about not being able to wrap up loose ends should something befall him during one of his romps through some remote corner of the world .  
In addition , as computer multimedia technology continues to mature , embedded video recorders , 3D glasses , other installations that allow for vivid sensory experience and simulated physical contact will soon be becoming available . Though the rich will be able to fully enjoy the thrill of the virtual world , poor folk will only be left with a deepened sense of deprivation .  
Trend expert John Naisbitt , in his High Tech , High Touch : Technology and Our Search for Meaning , discusses the threat posed to American youth by violent virtual reality games ( especially lifelike combat games ) , stating that they render children unable to distinguish between real and virtual . This in turn has generated a slew of on-campus firearms attacks that have left American society reeling .  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .  
Eventually , Min Sheng Daily agreed to add another gig , and the 2500 tickets for that were cleaned out in a single morning . After the event , the emcee , Chen Kai-lun , said that this was the most moving event he had ever hosted . There was not an empty seat to be found , no one left halfway through , and everyone felt as if they were being carried back in time on a genteel current of luxurious music .  
Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
Lin was born in 1959 in Taitung County 's Kuanshan . After graduating from junior high school , Lin 's father hoped that he would study at a vocational school and develop an occupational skill . However , Lin 's heart was set on going to senior high school and then to university . The father and son clashed and the result was that Lin attended neither vocational school nor high school ; he left home and headed for Taipei instead .  
The war not only left Vietnam with countless deformed children , but also greatly hindered its economic development . Today its national income per capita is only US $ 600 , less than one-tenth of that in Taiwan , and the state is unable to provide sufficient medical resources and personnel to treat so many patients .  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] . The depictions of Aborigines in Qing dynasty documents as long-haired brutes little different from animals reflected the Chinese understanding of aborigines as barbaric and backward .  
Yu used to hold down multiple jobs that kept him racing every day between the hospital , television station , radio station , and newspaper . For years he woke up brutally early to do radio and TV shows , stumbling home dead beat well after sundown . He developed a gastrointestinal problem that often left him doubled over in pain without any advance warning .  
The first carriage struck the mountain , the second and third carriages were crushed and overturned , and the fourth carriage fell five meters into a ravine . The tragedy left 17 dead and over 170 injured .  
Under the bright sunlight , Tzu Chi volunteers stay busy , and as they work their dark blue shirts becoming soaked with sweat ; when the clothes dry , the salt marks left behind look like white lotus flowers that have just bloomed .  
While Lai was in Japan he pored over the ancient Records of Artisanry , pondering and experimenting continuously in an effort to resurrect the long lost technique . But for years he was frustrated . Then , serendipity struck in 1986 . While making a wood base , he mixed the thinner left over from the day before into his lacquer .  
Although agriculture in Taiwan is generally on the decline and rural areas have been losing their young people , many of Kungkuan 's native sons and daughters who had left to pursue their educations or careers have recently been returning . In the same fields that their fathers and grandfathers tilled , they are now constructing European-style farms , traditional Hakka homesteads , and bright , modern farming villas . Apart from attracting tourists , they are recreating Kungkuan for themselves .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
Seventy-two year old Ting Tsai-po , Taiwan 's sole remaining salt worker of national treasure status , spent his entire life earning a living on the salt fields . He is the only one left who understands the salt channel system and how to repair and maintain it .  
In early August , during Typhoon Morakot , I left Tainan Airport and sped along the freeway . A few days earlier , a viaduct was completed and opened to traffic , cutting down the travel time between the airport and the park . After just under a half-hour , I arrived at a point in between the three townships of Hsinshi , Shanhwa , and Anting . Then , all of a sudden the storm cleared , and a tremendous vista spread out before me .  
In 1982 Wu learned of a school run by the Catholic Maryknoll Sisters that had been left empty when student numbers had fallen and was even flooded by a major typhoon . Located in a low-lying area , when a nearby river burst its banks the school was filled with all manner of dirt and river sludge and with no money for repairs was effectively abandoned for several years .  
In addition , in 1999 , after the streamlining of the provincial government , city and county chronic disease control offices either were merged with other agencies or discontinued their tuberculosis operations . Medical care for TB gradually shifted from specialist hospitals to regular health care institutions . Some of the highly trained tuberculosis specialists retired , while others left their jobs , or were assigned to other positions . The old TB prevention infrastructure today no longer exists .  
Wu had made separate molds for the orchids ' centers and five petals , so he invited an expert in " running water " welding to put them together . After six hours , the petals were only halfway assembled . The expert said that he really thought they should use traditional welding flux , but Wu Ching was determined and refused .
