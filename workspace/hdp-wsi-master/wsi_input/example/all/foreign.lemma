[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .

It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .

Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .

Reportedly , although many proposals on adjusting China 's foreign policy have been sent to Zhongnanhai , as a leadership change at the upcoming 16th party congress is not far away , Jiang Zemin hopes to accomplish the transfer of power in a stable political environment , so the difficult policy issues will be left up to his successor .

In the wake of the gradual deepening of China 's market-oriented reform of the foreign currency interest rates , its foreign currency interest rates are no longer shut in their own closed environment and are instead linking tracks with the international financial community ; they are following international practices and rules and regulations to increasingly move up and down in sync with the international interest rates .

As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .

On the basis that liberated areas had already developed foreign trade , a series of major measures were taken to comprehensively set up a socialist system governing foreign trade and economic cooperation .

As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .

Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .

We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
We adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace .  We have carried out friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries and treated one another as equals on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in a ceaseless effort to advance the cause of human progress .

With the pace of opening to the outside world further accelerated , China 's economy will merge into the world economy in a still positive attitude , and the domestic market will be integrated with the international market with each passing day , which will contribute to better utilizing the domestic and foreign resources and provide economic growth with even greater room for maneuver .  
Some relevant experts believe that after these mineral-exploration rights newly drafted by the Chinese Government are expanded and opened up , a large amount of foreign capital , technologies , and talented people will be attracted to take part in the risk exploration and development of mineral resources in Central and West China , which will play an active propelling role to the further exploration of the rich mineral resources in the whole country .  
Experts say that faced with a new development trend in the world auto industry marked by concentration , development of high and technologies , globalization of management , and by sophisticated production methods , China 's auto industry must develop a modern enterprise system that is adapted to that of foreign developed countries .  Reform , restructuring , and technological innovation are the fundamental way out to raise enterprises ' competitiveness .  
Shi Guangsheng , Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , stressed on the same occasion that an unconditional PNTR status with no strings attached [ gan jing li luo de 0051 0403 0448 5507 4104 ] is the prerequisite and foundation for the implementation of the Sino-US WTO bilateral agreement ; the Chinese side appreciated the commitment and efforts made by the US Government .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .  From the period when he was known as " Liuzhou tyrant " to the period when he served as a leader of the regional party committee and government , Liu sought illegal interests and made things convenient for his wife and children by abusing power .  He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .  
According to their analysis , experts maintained : Factors , such as the accelerated economic recovery in the Asian region , steady domestic economic growth , and the acceleration of China 's entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] have played an important role in the recovery of foreign capital utilization .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
With the " backing " of the huge defense budget , the extremely expansive and aggressive US military and foreign policy has worsened the international atmosphere and disrupted international order , and goes against the tide of the times of world peace and development ; it is " bad tidings " as mankind enters the new century .  
In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
It is necessary to take advantage of the opportune moment of the WTO entry to leave no stone unturned to expand exports and heighten the level of using foreign capital , maintain the current momentum of growth in foreign trade , and exercise the role of export demand in promoting economic growth .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
Personalities in foreign countries universally think that the Chinese policy to refrain from Renminbi 's devaluation in recent years has played a positive role in stabilizing the financial markets in Asia . As the principal decisionmaking department responsible for the exchange rate policies , the SAFE had a very good grasp of the policies , and its role is elevated accordingly .  
Xu Fangming listed the following facts to prove that China has no problem in repaying her sovereign foreign debts : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , China 's economy has developed by leaps and bounds , which has resulted in sustained , healthy , and stable national economic growth .  
Without PNTR , China eventually will still join the WTO , but if following China 's WTO entry , such factors of disharmony still exist in Sino-US relations , China 's development after WTO entry will be subject to the negative impact of conservative forces coming from within the United States and from Congress , which is unfavorable to China in its bid to make better use of the opportunity of WTO entry to do such things as investing , developing foreign economic and trade connections , and system reform .  
If the leader of the Taiwan authorities engages in wishful thinking that he can use a vague , dilatory , and evasive style to relegate the problem to the future , and throw the problem to foreign powers and the international community , the result will be something that he can not bear to imagine .  
The developed coastal areas and suburban districts of large and medium cities should proceed from their local superiority and give priority to the development of agriculture with fine quality and high efficiency as well as agriculture that earns foreign exchange .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
Meanwhile , the CSHRS must continue to take an active part in international human rights activities ; conduct more dialogues , exchanges , and cooperation with foreign organizations and personages ; and make unremitting efforts to enhance understanding and cooperation between the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world in upholding human rights , expand consensus unceasingly , and jointly promote the international community 's universal respect of human rights and basic freedom .  
The separatist forces have disregarded the historical trend of China 's reunification , and pleaded with foreign forces in a vain attempt to bring about " Taiwan independence . "  This is completely a futile effort out of their wishful thinking .  
However , cross-strait reunification has been delayed for a long time and we still have failed to conclude the 50-year-old state of hostility .  But Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] , who has been discarded by all the Chinese people , interrupted and hampered cross-strait exchanges and consultations whenever he could , created new troubles by proposing the " two-state theory " to split China 's national sovereignty and territory , and futilely attempted to materialize foreign powers ' dreams of splitting China 's national sovereignty and territory with his " two-state theory . "  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
The first is to suddenly employ large-scale military operations , using the effectiveness of a wave [ attack ] to make their military operations , transportation , communications , electric power , mass media , and other crucial facilities lose their function and utility , causing Taiwan to be paralyzed .  Only by having the first wave reach this kind of level can the foreign anti-Chinese forces be made to give up their plan of interfering .

It is in the course of developing normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries and in its struggle aimed at safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that the Chinese Government has adhered to the One China principle and has won both understanding and support from a growing number of countries and international organizations .  
In addition , regarding the 85 duty paragraphs of agricultural products which the US side is concerned about , the two sides agreed that the actual customs tariff of 30.8 percent at the signing of the agreement will be reduced to 14.5 percent in five years , the total amount of import quotas for wheat , rice , and corn set at 13 million tonnes in 2000 will be raised to 23 million tonnes in 2004 , and the business volume of non-state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be increased too .  
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to establish friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world , including Yugoslavia , on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and to make joint efforts for the establishment of a new , peaceful , stable , just , and rational political order so that mankind will have a better tomorrow .  
Engineering or other projects for the development of the west which are listed as key national projects , and especially major infrastructure construction projects , environmental protection projects , projects for processing local superior natural resources or local specialty products , advanced science and technology projects , S &amp; T and educational development projects , and other projects requiring the import of foreign equipment will receive priority in inspections and priority in examinations for quarantine , in order to assure support to construction .

Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
Taiwan 's industrial and commercial circle , political sphere , scholars , and media were all disappointed , and even foreign businessmen also indicated their dissatisfaction .  Taiwan 's stock market continued to fall for straight five days .  The general index fell from 9,119 points on 19 May to 8430 points on 25 May , a fall of almost 700 points .  
Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .

This research fellow of the State Council 's Development Studies Center said that the main obstacle to foreign enterprises operating in China arises from problems in the domestic setup ; in 1997 the Chinese Government set " building a state with legal system " as the basic goal in the reform of China 's political setup , and we should now make practical efforts to achieve this .  
At this summit , both Kim Chong-il and Kim Yong Nam have emphatically stressed the importance of " independence and reunification " ; and have pointed out that since " foreign countries are not happy to see a united Korean Peninsula to become a strong country " and will surely place various kinds of obstacles to hinder reunification , the Korean nation must rely on its own strength , independently resolve the nation 's internal contradictions , and bring true the country 's grand cause of reunification .

Observers have noted that the eight fields he mentioned would be open to the outside world step by step .  One of the fields included financial services , a field that was strictly restricted to foreign investors in the past .  This indicated the firm stand of the Chinese Government in abiding by relevant international rules and in implementing its commitments .  
He said : The Chinese people cherish friendly feelings toward the Croatian people .  When your country declared independence in 1991 , China rapidly recognized it and established diplomatic relations with it in 1992 .  This was a decision made by the Chinese Government pursuant to its independent foreign policy of peace and the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
In China , the small and medium size enterprises are the important components of the country 's economic structure .  The proportion of small and medium-size enterprises accounts for over 99 percent of the industry as a whole .  With staff members accounting for around 80 percent of the total , their industrial output value accounts for over 60 percent and foreign trade and exports , 68.53 percent .  Almost all the light industry , textile , garments , toys , and metal export products are provided by the small and medium-size enterprises .  
Albright also said that the months ahead will be very " substantial and busy " days in Sino-US relations .  She said : The US Senate will vote in early July on according China the permanent normal trade relations status ; I myself will meet Chinese foreign minister again in late July during the ASEAN regional forum period ; President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin will hold a meeting in September while they attend the UN millenium meeting of heads of state .

In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
Zhu Rongji summed up the state of the Chinese economy as follows : Since the Asian financial crisis , while the Chinese economy has sustained a severe and complex test , it has still kept quite a fast growth momentum , particularly in 2000 , when it has made a crucial turnaround .

7 .  The cultural , trade and economic , public security , information industry , foreign trade and economic affairs departments , customs houses , and administrations for industry and commerce at various levels must unify their thinking , increase their awareness , and further define their own functions and responsibilities .  Under the leadership of the local party committee and government , they must assume their responsibilities , closely coordinate with each other , and earnestly carry out their own administrative work and strengthen their routine supervision and management .  
The department for foreign trade and economic affairs must earnestly carry out its works well in examining and approving applications from the processing industry to process electronic game equipment and its parts and accessories and overseeing the re-export of the processed equipment , parts , and accessories out of the country .  It must coordinate with the customs houses to crack down on illicit activities in smuggling electronic game equipment , parts and accessories .  
adhere to the principles of " making the past serve the present , " " making foreign things serve China , " and " weeding through the old to bring forth the new , " actively inherit and carry forward outstanding traditional cultures , study hard , absorb , and use as reference outstanding foreign cultures while resisting all corrupt and decadent ideas and cultures of the exploiting class and opposing the " Westernization " and " division " schemes of hostile forces at home and abroad .  
The increase in domestic and foreign demand stimulated comprehensive improvement in the production sector and enabled China 's entire economy to develop toward a good orientation .  The quality of economic performance improved steadily .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She pointed out that while opening up wider to the outside world , the western region should pay attention to opening up to other parts of the country , establishing various kinds and forms of economic cooperation with the developed areas in the interior , supplementing each other 's advantages , making great efforts to develop high-tech enterprises , and jointly developing domestic and foreign markets to attain common development .  
They show in the face of the intricate international situation , Chinese leaders still hold fast to their judgment that peace and development remain the theme of the present-day world .  They uphold an independent foreign policy of peace while firmly adhering to the central task of economic development , which has enabled China to make new achievements of world interest on the diplomatic front and has steadily raised its international status .  
The foreign ministers of the five countries express their deep worry over the increasingly rampant activities of the forces of national separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .

"  
Wang Qishan said that : For a year and a half now , the courts and the GITICS Clearing Team have been acting in line with the law , regulations , and international practice , adhering to and reflecting the principles of openness , fairness , and impartiality in each step and every link , which has increased transparency and raised the public trust .  Both domestic and foreign debts have all been serviced equally , with the creditors being satisfied , and the social results also being good .  
Grounded in a conscientious summary of the experience of the previous stage , the Guangdong Party Committee and Government are acting as always , by giving all out support to the intensified pursuit and recovery of foreign debts by the courts and the clearance team .  We are converting bankrupt assets into cash and liquidating debts faster , in an effort to raise the debt service rate , for a satisfactory conclusion of the clearance and hearing of the GITICS bankruptcy case .  
In the long run , the RMB will move from a larger fluctuation range to floating freely , and will become freely convertible in the end ; and this can be said a gradual process of relaxing foreign exchange controls .  If such a process can be materialized in an appropriate way , the RMB can be turned into an international currency at the cost of the minimum shock .  
The Xinhua website is composed of websites sponsored by Xinhua News Agency , eight Chinese and foreign language websites under Xinhua , websites operated by 12 magazines affiliated to Xinhua , and 35 local Xinhua divisions and branches .  Each day , the new website will transmits in real time news reports in simplified and traditional Chinese , English , French , Spanish , Russian , Arab , and Japanese with a total wordage of over one million .  The maximum daily visits to the old website exceeded 10 million .  
Moreover , the planes ' main components and parts , equipment , airborne weapons , and maintenance technology are highly dependent on foreign countries .  Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , supply for the planes will become difficult and the number of such planes owned by the Taiwan Air Force will decrease with each plane shut down .  
With regard to building a rapid reaction mechanism for the market , we should make efforts to counter speculation in the foreign exchange realm our starting point , because once we join the WTO , the foreign currency management departments will of course have to employ after-the-fact inspections to uncover illegal activity in the foreign exchange realm and crack down on it sharply , but the more important thing will be the direct and preemptive disruption of speculative offensive behavior targeting China 's financial markets .  
At the mid-year national televised and telephone conference on foreign economic relations and trade which was held today , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , pointed out that it is possible to reach $ 200 billion , the target of export amount for the year 2000 set forth in the Ninth Five-Year Plan . Now we will strive to achieve this target ahead of schedule .  
In the first half of this year , China 's GDP grew at the rate of 8.2 percent , the financial sector operated steadily , and enterprises continued to increase their economic results , which have created favorable conditions for achieving the targets of the entire year 's national economic and foreign trade development .  
Wu Yi pointed out at the same time that confronted with the accelerated development of various countries in the world and the situation of increasingly keen competition , central and local departments at all levels in charge of foreign economic relations and trade must maintain a sober mind , follow the situation closely , analyze the difficulties and uncertain factors that they may encounter in work calmly and objectively , adopt effective measures in good time , and make great efforts to maintain the development momentum of various foreign trade business operations .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
It is learned that , since the name lists of our agents in the overseas and security personnel inside the country as well as the setup of the network are known to P'an Hsi-hsien like the back of his hand , the P'an case has created great tension for governments of those foreign countries which agreed to have our agents stationed there , because they fear their international relations and state security might be endangered should the relevant information fall into the hands of the Chicom [ Chinese communist ] authorities .  
After Putin was elected as Russia 's top leader , his administrative principles and foreign policy have become calmer and more pragmatic , and he has paid more attention to domestic affairs and become more familiar with the European security issue .  Some media maintained that Putin was focusing on the foreign affairs related to the United States and Europe .  
However , Putin 's China visit itself and his recent series of speeches on the policy toward China have clearly proven that the current Russian Government has not diminished its attention to Asia , and that it has fully affirmed and highly valued the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation , regarded China as Russia 's most important cooperative partner , and considered Sino-Russian relations the area Russia should develop on a priority basis in implementing its foreign policy .  
Governor of People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] Dan Xianglong today [ 19 July ] said at a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for Chinese and foreign reporters that , during the first half of this year , the PBOC further developed the role of monetary policy , strengthened financial support to economic growth , unveiled a number of management methods and policies , maintained a steady increase of money supply , and significantly promoted a recovery of the national economic growth .  
In fact , the amount of contractual foreign investments used by Guangdong has been on the increase in the first half of this year , the economy has been developing along a stable and improving trend , and the province 's economic vigor has increased quite remarkably .  
Moreover , we have also standardized or systematized the measures adopted by the supervision and management organs in the past in managing the financial companies and have laid down requirements for supervising or managing the financial companies in a unified way in their business relating to both domestic and foreign capital , both domestic and foreign currencies , as well as their business stated on or not on tables .  
Additionally , the new " procedures " have standardized and systemized the measures the supervisory and management organs adopted to manage financial companies and have realized the unified supervision and management of the domestic and foreign capital , the domestic and foreign currencies , and the scheduled and unscheduled operations of financial companies .  
After hearing the reports , the State Council leading comrades pointed out : The development of high-energy physics and advanced accelerators is of great significance to raising the standard of science and technology in the country .

The number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises and the amounts of money involved in new agreements both increased by more than 20 percent , thus bringing about a gleam of hope to the people .  However , we can not be optimistic about the foreign capital inflow situation for this year because the actual input of foreign capital remains stagnant .  
The downward trend of foreign capital inflow was checked in the first half of this year thanks to the upward trend of the international economy and the economic recovery of Asia .  
We should also see that this upward trend was based on the continuous decrease in the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises in the past two years and the sharp decrease in the amount of money involved in the agreements signed last year .  So , we can not say with certainty that China will usher in another high tide of foreign capital inflow .  
China has ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of foreign capital inflow .  It is not realistic to expect China to witness a high , sustainable growth in foreign capital inflow as it did in the middle of the 1990 ' s .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
As of the end of this year , China has successively approved the establishment of an accumulated total of more than 350,000 foreign-funded enterprises , with the relevant contracts involving foreign investment amounting to more than $ 630 billion ; and the foreign capital actually utilized over these years has exceeded $ 320 billion .  
In the face of such a new situation , ever since last year , the DPRK has been taking active steps to readjust its foreign policies .  It has engaged itself in multilateral diplomatic activities ; and has made positive headway in such aspects as improving the North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula , strengthening its relations with neighboring countries , and seeking to promote its ties with both western countries and countries in other parts of the world .  
The expanded domestic and foreign demand has brought an overall production improvement , with industrial operating quality markedly improved .  It is understood that over one-half of the losing large and medium state-owned enterprises [ SOE ] and state-owned stock-control or holding enterprises have now overcome their difficulties .  
In the white paper on " One-China Principle and Taiwan Issue , " the Chinese Government announced clearly that if a major change of events occurred where Taiwan is alienated from China in whatever name , if foreign forces invade and occupy Taiwan , and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuses to solve the cross-strait reunification issue peacefully through talks , the Chinese Government will be forced to adopt all possible drastic measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity so as to accomplish China 's great cause of reunification .  
They said their current first visit to China as " Troika " foreign ministers fully demonstrates the great importance the Rio Group attaches to developing its relations with China .

Supreme People 's Court Vice President Zhu Mingshan said today at a briefing on reform of the court structure that in order to meet the new demands and challenges on judicial work resulting from economic globalization and China 's WTO accession , the Supreme People 's Court will carry out a major reform of the court establishment and set up the no . 4 civil cases court specifically to deal with maritime affairs and law and disputes involving foreign and Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan businessmen .  
2 .  The stock and foreign exchange markets remain bearish due to the tension in the Taiwan Strait , the stock market has fallen below 8,000 points and is still falling , and the economic fluctuation , while reflecting the popular feeling , is demoralizing the people ;  
In October the same year , the Bank of China promulgated the " Notice Concerning Risk Control by Commercial Banks While Handling International Settlement of Forward Letters of Credit . " It provides that " commercial banks , in handling their forward letters of credit business , must strictly follow state policies for foreign exchange control and the use of foreign capital , and they must have a genuine background of commodity trade . "  The notice also requires commercial banks to establish sound mechanisms for internal management and control .  
12 .  Article 23 shall be revised as : " Any exterior design for which a patent right may be granted shall not be identical with or similar to any exterior design that has , before the date of application , been publicly reported in a domestic or foreign publication or been publicly used in the country and shall not interfere with any legitimate rights obtained earlier by another person . "  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
After taking office , Putin laid down a national development strategy designed to " make the country strong and people rich " and tentatively worked out an intermediate - and long-term economic development plan .  However , Russia 's heavy foreign debts , the difficulty in attracting investment , and the lack of money have become the main obstacle to Russia 's reform and economic revitalization .  
To cut off Chechnyan rebellious armed forces ' foreign aid and route of retreat and to create conditions for a comprehensive and complete settlement of the Chechen issue , Putin has been working actively to obtain the understanding and support of the international community .  
Putin 's diplomatic maneuvering of the last several months shows that in his foreign policy , he has a long-term strategic goal as well as strong consideration of the reality .  His overall foreign policy goal is defined as " ensuring national security " and " developing a good external environment for economic growth " to revitalize Russia .

The active use of foreign investments has promoted sustained , healthy , and rapid development in China 's economy , and particularly promoted China 's economic restructuring and industrial optimization .  It also has provided valuable business opportunities and vast markets to the large number of international investors ; intensified the integration of China 's economy with the world economy ;  
and added an enchanting brilliance to the prosperity and development of the global economy .  China 's stable political situation , social security , and an economy that has always maintained a relatively high speed of development , are key to China 's achievements in attracting foreign business investments .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .  
The existing industrial foundations , technological capabilities , rich natural resources , and superiority in labor resources in the central and western regions will provide favorable conditions for foreign businesses to participate in the cooperative development of China 's central and western regions .

Meanwhile , it should also support scientific research organizations , institutions of higher learning , and enterprises in restructuring their internal distribution systems in an effort to create favorable working and living conditions for the scientists , technicians , senior operators , and managers who have made outstanding contributions in the course of technological innovation and industrialization .  Consequently , they can attract more outstanding Chinese and foreign professionals with attractive environments , systems , and mechanisms .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .  
Wu Bangguo stated that , in a year that is filled with hope at the crossroads of the old and new centuries , the third generation of collective leadership that is centered around comrade Jiang Zemin has held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping theory , conforming to the trends in world developments , pressing forward resolutely with reforms , and producing achievements in both internal and foreign affairs that have gained worldwide attention .  
It is necessary to step up efforts to make use of foreign capital and to actively introduce advanced technology , qualified personnel , and managerial expertise from abroad ; efforts should be made to accelerate the readjustment of the industrial structure , to upgrade the industry , to make technological innovations , to raise the quality and grade of products , and to make the products brand-name ones .  
In order to meet the requirements of China 's development of the western region , Wan Xueyuan , director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs , said here today that China 's hiring of foreign experts in the coming year will be focused on the development strategy of the western region .  We will draw the experience of foreign countries in regional development and implement the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , Wan Xueyuan said , we should enormously attract qualified personnel from the eastern region to participate in the economic construction and development of the western region , and also attract people from other countries , including Chinese students studying abroad and foreign experts .

If war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , and sea transport is blockaded , foreign trade as a support for economic development will suffer serious setbacks , many industrial production departments will halt production and close down , and the entire economy will be facing tremendous blows .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
It is expected : During the " Ninth Five-Year Plan " period , China will in total have attracted $ 230 billion of foreign capital , nearly 100 percent more than in the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " period .  For seven consecutive years since 1993 , China has been the champion among developing countries for attracting foreign capital .  
It was precisely at this extraordinary time and in a domestic and foreign environment of unprecedented complexity that , by relying on the concerted efforts of the entire people to overcome various difficulties , we still accomplished the " 9th Five-Year " plan successfully , ensuring the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the national economy and comprehensively accomplishing the second strategic step in the drive to modernization .

He deeply felt the sincere wishes of the governments of the four countries to develop ties with China .  
Since in history imperialism used Catholicism and Protestantism to serve its national political interests , certain foreign missionaries relied on the unequal treaties to commit all kinds of outrages and caused over 1,500 large and small missionary cases [ jiao an ] , for which many Chinese lost their lives , and a number of Chinese Catholics also became innocent victims ; these historical wounds are still there in the hearts of the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church .  
Though the total amount of foreign capital utilized increased , the actual amount of foreign capital utilized dropped continuously due to last year 's drop in the contracted amount .  However , the contracted amount of foreign capital still reached $ 33.2 billion during the first eight months , up by more than 30 percent compared with the same period of last year .  
In 1999 , our country utilized almost $ 40.4 billion of foreign capital in real terms , down by 12.8 percent from the previous year , despite maintaining a significant scale , which showed the first negative growth in the last few years , with the amount of contracted foreign capital also falling for the first time in the past many years .

Disregarding strong opposition from the Chinese Government and the Chinese Catholic Church , the Vatican today held a ceremony to " canonize " a number of foreign missionaries and their followers as " saints " who committed hideous crimes in China . This is a serious confrontational incident against the 1.2 billion Chinese people .  
The 120 people " canonized " by the Vatican this time included a host of foreign missionaries .  Most of them died during the period from the Opium Wars to the Yihetuan Movement .

Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .  
It is not likely that the additional foreign capital that has flowed into China will change the general pattern of the capital flow in the world , or affect the amount of foreign capital flowing into developing countries .  A large project given to China may give rise to the construction of supporting production networks in surrounding countries , thereby enabling these countries to obtain even more foreign capital .  This shows even more clearly the economic ties and complementary nature of China and other developing countries .

He maintained : The joint statement that the foreign ministers of the two countries are due to sign is a very important document , which will establish a sound legal framework and guiding principles for the development of relations between the two countries in the new situation , and which will give a strong impetus to bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
In addition , the vigor in the areas of attacking smuggling , trafficking of smuggled goods , foreign exchange fraud , illegal procurement of foreign exchange , the manufacture and sales of fraudulent goods , and other crimes has also clearly expanded , and the big legal cases of Liang Yaohua 's [ a high-level party official ] exceptionally large smuggling case , the Shantou City smuggling case , and others have been investigated and dealt with accordingly .

The election this year was held at a time when the US economy is prospering for the ninth successive year , the social environment is relatively stable , and the United States has maintained its strong international status .

However , Tien Hung-mao was unwilling to reconfirm Li Hsien-jen 's statements .  He stressed : Li Hsien-jen , as a convenor of the Foreign Affairs Committee , should be aware of the contents of such highly sensitive political statements .  Deputy Minister David Ta Wei Lee [ Li Ta-wei ] also pointed out on 18 December : Previously , because of their status in the opposition party , Bush 's personal aides who make decisions on foreign policies had opportunities to visit Taiwan and held talks with our government officials .

The police estimated that after the crackdowns in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first half of next year , they should be able to eliminate some of the larger local triads , fully curb the activities of foreign triads in the mainland , and bring about an obvious improvement in public order in the coastal areas .  
" There is no lack of senior government officials and expert scholars who are familiar with East Asian affairs , international foreign affairs , and military security in the core members of the new Bush cabinet .  The basic tone and route of the China policy from Washington tends to establish a pragmatism .  We have to deal with it in a calmer and more rational attitude of dealing with concrete matters relating to work . "  
However , Lin Zhongbing , who is familiar with the political situation of US , China , and Taiwan , thinks that , " I am afraid that if we have expectations that are too high , or we look forward to a dramatic change of our already decided policy of the realm of our foreign affairs international activities , it would be unrealistic .

American media started to call Clinton a " lame duck " before the curtain was raised on the election campaign in the first half of this year , meaning that as he was soon to leave office , domestic attention switched the new master of the White House who would replace him , while international opinion would gradually take an attitude of observation , so it would be hard to him to have much impact on domestic and foreign affairs in the future .

China will conduct international science and technology cooperation of a higher level on the basis of equality , mutual benefit , and shared achievements , enhance the country 's scientific and technological creation ability , develop advanced science and technology , and serve the industrialization of new technology .  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;  
The policies and measures involved in the circular included increasing construction fund , giving priority to launching construction projects , stepping up transfer of financial payment , strengthening support for financial loan , implementing a preferential taxation policy , implementing a preferential policy on land and mineral resources , further expanding the area of foreign investment , expanding the channel of foreign capital utilization , and increasing educational investment .  
This reporter learned from the ongoing National Work Conference on Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held here that on behalf of China , the consulting body will fulfill over 100 information-related obligations as required by the WTO , give authoritative answers to questions from WTO member states about China 's trade policy , and provide consulting services for enterprises and the parties concerned in relation to WTO rules and foreign trade and economic policies .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .  
The introduction of these policies and measures is conducive to increasing fund input for the western development , improving the environment for investment in the western region , opening the western region still wider to both foreign and domestic investors , and giving greater support to the development of science , technology , education , and the training of talented personnel in the western region .  It will certainly produce an important effect in pushing forward the implementation of the large-scale western development strategy in a positive and orderly way .  
Zeng : To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should be adapted to the trend of economic globalization and China 's upcoming accession to the WTO , seize the opportunity of opening up still wider to foreign and domestic investors , enlarge the spheres of investment by foreign businessmen , broaden the channel of using foreign capital , make positive use of foreign loans , vigorously develop foreign economic relations and trade , and expand economic and technological exchange and cooperation with various countries in the world including the neighboring countries .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : In the 21st century , China will continue to resolutely and unwaveringly uphold the reform and opening-up policy and pursue an independent foreign policy of peace .  China will actively develop friendly and cooperative ties with all other countries , based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and strive to establish an equitable and rational world order in the political and economic arenas .  
Although its foreign aid amount rose to $ 14 billion in 1999 , it accounted for only 0.15 percent of its total output value that year , which was $ 9 trillion .  Moreover , $ 3 billion of this money was specifically reserved for its ally Israel and $ 2.1 billion for Egypt , which signed a peace treaty with Israel . France can be regarded as relatively generous .  
It is readily apparent that the new " cross-strait " structure of " eternal peace " and " political union " that the Taiwanese leader calls for is a " security structure " with a guaranteed " independent standing . "  Under an international strategic position , foreign powers would use this structure to " contain ( China 's ) surroundings " and extend Taiwan a protective umbrella .  
Insofar as Shanghai 's industrial sector at large is concerned , lower tariffs are expected to help textile enterprises , under structural readjustment at the moment , further invite or draw upon advanced foreign technology or products ; to enhance capabilities of developing or introducing new products with hi-tech contents ; or to accelerate structural readjustment as a whole .  
In improving the order of market the economy and developing the functions of customs , we should mainly launch incessant struggles against smuggling , work in coordination with concerned departments to crack down on tax rebate fraud , illegal remittance and procurement of foreign exchange and other criminal activities .  We should standardize various operations related to imports and exports , and maintain normal order in imports and exports .  
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [ HKSAR ] has not intervened or prohibited them .  With things continually developing in depth , however , people have paid closer attention to them and even worried that Hong Kong may be used as the " Falungong 's " activities " center " and become the " base " for foreign anti-China forces ' vain attempt to subvert the Chinese Government .  
After the meeting closed , Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , who attended the meeting , granted an exclusive interview with this reporter at which he talked about his views on the meeting 's outcome , the current situation and prospects of Asia-Europe cooperation , the Asian and European economic situations , foreign exchange mechanism , the prospects of East Asia regional cooperation , and other issues .  
At the State Administration of Exchange Control 's annual meeting this week , Lu Nanping , deputy director , said , amid the steady improvement in the national economic environment last year , China 's foreign exchange balance was able to maintain a good developmental trend ; the state 's foreign exchange reserve increased , and the RMB exchange rate remained basically stable .  
The century of striving by the Chinese nation in making consistent efforts to become stronger , working hard for national prosperity , resisting foreign bullying , and upholding unification has written a moving and tragic but glorious chapter , and laid the foundation for China 's development ; it shines through the ages , and all Chinese should be proud of it .  
It is learned that in the great development of the west , the state will delegate more extensive authorization to manufacturing enterprises in the western region to engage themselves directly in foreign trade , and will adopt a series of favorable policies to encourage the exports of good-quality and marketable products and the undertaking of overseas construction contracts and labor cooperation projects .  
When talking about his government 's foreign policy in his administrative policy speech , Yoshiro Mori said : In the first half of the 21st century , Japan 's basic diplomatic strategy in the Asia-Pacific region will be based on its alliance with the United States and oriented to strengthening the friendly ties with the ROK , its neighbor , and maintaining a stable pattern in the Asia-Pacific region through building up mutually trusted and harmonious relations with China and Russia .  
Moreover , we should base ourselves on China 's realities and conscientiously sum up and utilize our own successful experience in training and managing our athletes on one hand and , on the other hand , persist in opening to the outside world , continue to draw on the good practices of foreign countries which are conducive to raising the level of our athletics , make full use of the modern science and technology to enhance the quality of training , and enable China 's athletics to attain a still greater development in the new century .  
By listing themselves overseas , China 's enterprises are not only able to raise funds for faster development , but also make use the listing to change the original unilateral capital structure of sole government ownership .  With the change of capital structure , it is able to develop enterprises under the mixed form of ownership with the participation of foreign investment , establish a corporate legal person management structure with diversified investments , and further build a modern enterprise system .  
This source also said that the Beijing authorities have had evidences showing that the foreign journalists detained on that day had known beforehand that " Falungong " practitioners would engage in fierce activities in Tiananmen Square . After verifying that these journalists really involved themselves in the drawing up of the plot for this incident , the Beijing authorities will not rule out taking legal actions against these journalists on charge of intentional murder because they " had instigated and assisted others to commit suicide . "  
These people are subject to the manipulation of foreign powers and the harmful leadership of a heretical teaching .  The ideology is extreme , the behavior is boundless , and it is very difficult to guarantee that a self-burning incident like the one in Tiananmen will not happen in Hong Kong or perhaps yet another burning tragedy in the country .  
They acted in cahoots with some organizations opposing the central government and harassing Hong Kong , worked in concert with the inland " Falungong " cult organization , and cooperated closely with foreign anti-China forces to do whatever they pleased by exploiting Hong Kong 's special political environment .  They directed the spearhead of their attack at the central government and the Special Administrative Region government , causing great worries and restlessness among the great majority of Hong Kong residents .  
Since the beginning of 2000 , the volume of contracted foreign investment has rapidly recovered and begun to climb up , driven by the effect of the pending WTO accession and a major turnaround in China 's domestic economy .  However , the volume of actual foreign investment continued to drop , due to the delayed effect from the drop of contracted foreign investment in the previous year .  By the end of November , the amount of foreign investment in real terms was 2.29 percent lower than the same period of the previous year .  
To do a good job of attracting foreign investment under the new circumstances , the crucial thing is to uphold the policy of actively and effectively attracting foreign capital and vigorous raise the quality and level of foreign investment while focusing closely on the needs of our national economic development and restructuring .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
Ma Yingjiu accepted intensive interviews from Taiwan , Hong Kong , China , and foreign media yesterday .  He pointed out that his trip was not for the reason of improving cross-strait relations .  His visit to Hong Kong was helpful for exchanges between the two cities , promoting the improvement of Taiwan-Hong Kong relations , and building a harmonious atmosphere .  Indirectly , it also improved cross-strait relations .  This benefits our central government as well .  
President Chen pointed out that as a state leader , he deeply understands the implications of cross-Strait relations on domestic politics , foreign relations , economy and trade , national defense and other sectors .  He described this as " a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole . "  He also recognized the popular wish for a " stable and peaceful situation in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Shi Fenghai pointed out : It is expected that foreign capital will be concentrated first in high-profit business fields and areas - - international and domestic long-distance calls , IP telephony , Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other important eastern areas will become the key business fields and areas which foreign capital will enter .  
Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .  
Answer : Generally speaking , they will have to prepare themselves in the following three ways : First , they should change their rules governing trading in the B shares and make public on an earlier date concrete measures for mainland investors with legitimate foreign exchange funds to open a B-share account and a capital account ;  
The gradual and conditional opening of the B share market in China will greatly promote the process of internationalization of the Chinese securities markets and make good preparations for the realization of an unified , and open international securities markets , where the free exchange of renminbi for foreign money can be realized while dealing with capital items in the future .  
( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
A person in charge of the CSRC said that the current policy readjustment was made mainly due to the consideration that marked changes have taken place in the macroeconomic situation regarding the capital movement of foreign exchange in China , and corresponding adjustments to the market orientation , rules , functions , and so on have been put forward in line with the requirements of the national economic development .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
As the principal responsible person of a local party committee , he abandoned the proper political responsibility of a leading cadre , discarded the principles of party spirit , became a crony of an illicit foreign businessman , went in for bartering power for money in a big way , led a number of cadres astray , damaged the party style and social atmosphere , ruined the party 's image , and damaged state interests , causing serious consequences to local economic and social development .  
In the past five years , the 11th Panchen Lama has been accorded great kindness by high priests of Tibetan Buddhism and the worship and support of the vast number of believers .  He has received numerous local and foreign living Buddhas and high priests , held many religious meetings for the monks , and touched the heads of followers to bless them .  
In the face of WTO challenges , such as increased imports and foreign advanced marketing methods , Wang Jinshan said , supply and marketing cooperatives departments and affiliated organizations nationwide should make use of their limited time to further intensify reform , quicken the pace of development , and meet challenges with a positive posture .  
It is common knowledge that the Tiananmen area is an important venue where the party and the state hold major state and diplomatic events and a high-profile mecca for Chinese and foreign tourists .  It is the political , cultural , and international exchange center of our country and represents and symbolizes the Chinese nation , so it occupies an extremely important position .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
At the turn of the century , China 's economy is facing a great deal of opportunities and challenges against the domestic and international background : After more than 20 years of reform and opening up , the domestic market has shaken off the longstanding condition of short supply , the structure of a market economy has been established in a preliminary form , and a fundamental change has occurred in foreign economic relations ;  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
We are also facing the arduous tasks of reforming the education and scientific research systems , the administrative system , the financial system , the investment system , the taxation system , the foreign trade system , the social security system , the income distribution system , the medical and public health system , and especially the leadership system , the economic system , and the management systems in all aspects .  In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
Delegate Jiang Demin believes that " We must improve the economic value for intellectuals .  Although domestic treatment still can not compare with that of foreign countries , we can adopt some special , favorable policies to permit talent returned from overseas to draw a certain percentage of sharing in the profits from their technologies , and permit them to hold multiple positions and salaries . "  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
All the increase and reduction have expressed a kind of spirit of " seeking progress while ensuring stability . "  The budget has not done anything harmful to current social stability , economic recovery , or long-term healthy economic development , but has promoted what is conducive to improving the business environment , attracting foreign investment , and encouraging the training of capable personnel .  In this way , the increase and reduction of taxes and charges have been used to readjust the government 's financial revenue and expenditure and to promote social and economic development .  
In answering a relevant question raised by a foreign journalist , Zhu Bangzao said that the US military spending this year is $ 14 billion more than last year and this increase is almost equivalent to China 's national defense spending last year .  Double standard should not be used on this issue .  
In conformity with the requirements for WTO accession , " local content , " " export performance " and other stipulations that are inconsistent with WTO rules will be removed from this basic law for foreign investment which paved the way for the rush of foreign investors into the country .  The present amendment is the biggest move made by China to date in its review and revision of foreign-related laws and regulations in anticipation of WTO accession .  
We should - - by means of making enterprises go listed inside and outside the territory , utilizing foreign capital , absorbing social entities , and attracting civilian capital - - bring in investment from all sides and form multiple investment entities , so as to bring about aggregate increase in the state-owned economy , yet with a decreased proportion of state-owned capital and greater control .  
The deputies from Shanghai maintained in their deliberation that the current amendment work fits in with the requirements of China 's further opening up and economic globalization , and has reflected the continual deepening of the work to open to the outside world and to attract foreign funds , the continual perfection of the system , and the continual enhancement of understanding .  
In the meantime , he suggested that while revising some laws , China should speed up the study and formulation of pertinent laws that are conducive to safeguarding the interests and economic security of the country and protecting national industries , including the laws on antidumping , antimonopoly , and so on with measures to guarantee their enforcement , improve and perfect the legal system of the socialist market economic structure , and create conditions for enterprises to make overseas investment and found undertakings in foreign countries .  
Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .  As far as hundreds of millions of peasants are concerned , it is rather difficult to increase their incomes by simply relying on growing crops .  Having insufficient stamina , township enterprises , which flourished some years ago , find it hard to become a major channel for increasing peasants ' incomes in a short period of time .  
The volume of trade between the two sides accounts for 40 percent of Hong Kong 's foreign trade volume .  In the period of the " Tenth Five-Year Plan , " the volume of import and export trade of the mainland will increased to $ 680 billion , and a large part of the cargoes will be transported via Hong Kong . This will directly benefit Hong Kong 's economic development , and will be favorable to giving play to Hong Kong 's advantages as an international financial , trade , and shipping center .  
cheating on taxes or foreign exchange , smuggling , or fraudulent bidding practices in the construction sector have run rampant ; cases of violating financial or economic disciplines have persisted despite repeated prohibitions ; and major , serious , or even fatal accidents relating to production safety have also time and again broken , and these have inflicted grave losses on the state interests or people 's life or property ;  
Zhu Bangzao pointed out that we have noticed that some media spread news about the incident in an irresponsible manner before it was thoroughly investigated , and some foreign media also spread untrue information about the incident .  They embellished the incident , distorted facts , and attacked China . Such acts have violated the professional ethnic of correspondents and are preposterous and wrong .  
With the legal system and rules as the basis , reform as the motive force , and development as the goal , in accordance with China 's undertakings given in foreign negotiations , we will take full advantage of the transitional period in China 's WTO accession to speed up the establishment of a new foreign economic and trade setup compatible with international norms and China 's national condition .  
We should develop fine national culture , absorb advanced cultural achievements of foreign countries , speed up the building of cultural facilities , comprehensively enliven literary and artistic creation , and strive to increase the competitive power of cultural undertakings and products of our country .  
From 1996 to 2000 , China took in direct foreign investment in the amount of $ 2134.8 billion ( amount actually received ) , an 87 percent increase in comparison to the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " , while the annual average of foreign capital taken in held steady at more than US $ 40 billion .  
We should hasten to suit these requirements through structural changes in various aspects , and move toward internationalization by merging with the international prevailing standards as soon as possible in terms of the improvement and perfection of administrative and management structure , foreign economic and trade structure , and service system and the concrete operation of agreement negotiations , project examination and approval , interest distributions , and contract fulfillment . 
When the first NPC was called , there were only four special committees .  And when the Ninth NPC was called , the number of special committees was already increased to nine unfolding works in the areas of education , science , culture and public health , law , internal and judicial affairs , nationalities , environmental and resources protection , finance and economy , overseas Chinese affairs , foreign affairs , agriculture and rural affairs in accordance with law and the wishes of the people .  
In a collective interview with Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday , Bo Xilai , a deputy to the Ninth National People 's Congress and Liaoning provincial governor , said it is necessary to build an innovative , industrious , and clean government , pay real attention to solid work , and invigorate Liaoning .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
It is necessary to further improve the investment environment , formulate policies that will encourage investment in geographic survey , prospecting and developing mineral resources in the western areas , guiding domestic and foreign investors to making investment in the western areas , and promoting the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of mining industries in the western areas .  
Attaching great importance to the building of the contingent of our country 's diplomats stationed in foreign countries , the Party Central Committee has analyzed the situation of the existing contingent in a thorough-going manner and in light of the situation of international competition at the start of the new century and the arduous tasks confronting the battlefront of foreign affairs of our country put forth explicit requirements for further strengthening the building of the contingent of diplomats stationed in foreign countries as well as its education and management works .  
It is necessary to act according to the guiding principle of widening the field of vision , extensively selecting talented people , promoting exchanges , optimizing structures , intensifying training , enhancing quality , strengthening management , perfecting supervision , and basing ourselves on reality , but having our eyes on the future to strive to build up a high-quality contingent of diplomats stationed in foreign countries which can meet the needs of the new century and new tasks .  
Article 11 .  Net profits distributed to foreign partners of Sino-foreign joint ventures after they have fulfilled their legal obligations and obligations stipulated in relevant agreements and contracts , and fund received by foreign partners after their joint ventures ' operational periods expire or upon termination of the joint ventures and other funds they receive may be remitted to overseas in the currency stipulated in governing contracts according to PRC foreign exchange control regulations .  
the WTO requires various member countries , whether large or small , to implement the principle of nondiscriminating trade treatment ; a legal system and good market order are a regular way to attract international investment , especially investment from transnational corporations , and the practice of relying on preferential policies and special regional treatment to attracting foreign investment will be no longer effective ;  
Having freed themselves from imperialist and colonialist domination and won national liberation and independence after centuries of foreign oppression and enslavement , developing countries find themselves now on the world stage with a completely new image and growing ranks .  Thanks to their unremitting efforts of several decades , the overall strength of developing countries has increased remarkably , their international status has risen and the prospects of their economic growth look promising .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
" After careful consideration of all relevant factors , we have concluded that the minimum allowable wage for foreign domestic helpers should remain at the present level of $ 3,860 a month during 1998 , " a government spokesman said .  
" The factors that we have considered include the wage movements of local workers in comparable sectors , the prevailing economic situation in Hong Kong , and the value of the remuneration package of the foreign domestic helpers in terms of their national currencies .  
" We possess strong economic fundamentals , with a high saving rate , large fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves and a remarkable productivity capacity .  
" Of course , our US $ 92.8 billion foreign reserves , the third largest in the world , and our healthy banking and financial systems as well as our strong economic fundamentals , have all played a vital role in enabling us to maintain the linked exchange rate , " he said .  
Mr Little said that apart from legal co-operation arrangements , the Basic Law also authorises the Hong Kong SAR to enter into binding international agreements with foreign States and international organisations in various fields including economic , trade , financial and monetary , shipping , communications , tourism , cultural and sport .  
" Given the sheer size of the public and private sector foreign currency debts of the affected economies , the role of the international lender of last resort can not be fulfilled by the IMF or any single central bank without the participation of the private sector , " said Mr Yam .  
We have a free and open economy ; excellent regulatory systems ; huge fiscal and foreign reserves ; tried , tested and successful fiscal policies ; level playing field for all who do business here ; a vigorous anti-corruption commission ; a versatile and flexible workforce ; and world class infrastructure and communication .  
Banks ' finances are generally healthy and well cushioned , the Government holds substantial fiscal and foreign exchange reserves and is not burdened by any public debt , the corporate sector is slimming and rationalising its operations for greater efficiency and competitiveness , the labour force is adapting promptly to more stringent employment conditions , inflation is moderating , and the economy as a whole is displaying the profound flexibility that is indeed required for it to weather the present difficulties . 
" To maintain our US / HK dollar link , we have an effective currency board system backed by the third largest foreign reserves in the world , a high savings rate , a strong fiscal position with no government foreign debt , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent , flexible , labour force and first-class infrastructure . "  
We possess a large cumulative fiscal surplus , substantial foreign exchange reserves , and remarkable productive capacity underpinned by a competent labour force and first-rate infrastructure .  
However , with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hong Kong people , expanding economy of the Mainland together with the traditional prudent financial management , sound banking system , huge foreign exchange reserve that support a stable exchange rate , we continue to look forward to our future with confidence .  
The triennial survey of the foreign exchange and derivatives markets in Hong Kong showed that the average net daily turnover of foreign exchange and OTC derivatives transactions in Hong Kong amounted to US $ 82.4 bn in April 1998 ( a decline of 12.8% from the US $ 94.4 bn in 1995 and equivalent to an annual compounded decline of 4.5% ) .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals were very strong , and together with its huge foreign currency reserves , a stable currency , and excellent financial and banking systems , the territory 's recovery from the downturn would be amongst the first in the region . 
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .  
The Mission observed that the attack on the Hong Kong dollar in August and the pressures in the foreign exchange and securities markets were more intense than earlier episodes , and they acknowledged that the government 's unprecedented operations in the stock and futures markets , aided by an improving external environment , had succeeded in calming market conditions .  
The Government announced today ( Tuesday ) that the minimum allowable wage ( MAW ) for employment contracts of foreign domestic helpers ( FDHs ) in Hong Kong to be signed on or after February 3 , 1999 will be set at $ 3,670 a month .  This is $ 190 or five per cent less than the existing minimum allowable wage of $ 3,860 a month .  
For example , Article 109 provides that the HKSAR government shall maintain the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre .  Article 110 provides that the HKSAR government shall , on its own , formulate monetary and financial policies .  Article 111 prescribes that the Hong Kong dollar , as the legal tender in the HKSAR , shall continue to circulate .  Article 112 states that no foreign exchange control policies shall be applied in the HKSAR and that the Hong Kong dollar shall be freely convertible .  
When raising funds in Hong Kong , mainland entities are treated as other international and local market participants .  Mainland companies listed in Hong Kong are required to abide by security laws of Hong Kong and are regulated by the relevant regulatory authorities in Hong Kong . Disputes relating to financial transactions are handled in accordance with international practice .  Where China 's Arbitration Law and other relevant laws and regulations are applicable according to the terms of a contract , the provisions relating to arbitration involving foreign parties are applied .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .  
Two years ago , gloomy scenarios were being painted - not about an Asian financial crisis - but about the impending demise of Hong Kong 's monetary autonomy under Chinese rule : about the breaking of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S . dollar , the absorption of Hong Kong 's substantial foreign reserves by the Mainland , and so on .  
For example , foreign banks generally kept much smaller clearing balances because their lack of extensive retail networks made their liquidity less vulnerable to unpredictable swings , and because their dependence on interbank funding implied a higher opportunity cost in holding surplus liquidity than was faced by banks with a sizeable retail deposit base .  
Members also noted potential practical disadvantages and risks involved in a two-way undertaking : among these were the greater opportunities that might be provided for speculative attacks on the currency and the possibility that too narrow a bid-offer spread might displace a substantial part of foreign exchange business involving the Hong Kong dollar .  
During the investigation of a false contract case , it was discovered that an employment agent had arranged bogus employers to some foreign domestic helpers .  The defendant was suspected to be one of the bogus employers and was located for further investigation .  
If a foreign domestic helper chooses to make an entry visa application on the existing standard employment contract which permits driving duties incidental to and arising from domestic duties , the foreign domestic helper and his / her employer are reminded that it normally takes six weeks for the employment contract to be completed by the foreign domestic helper overseas , subsequent attestation by the local Consulates-General and to reach the Immigration Department . 
" Since it was previewed by the media on December 30 , the 280-metre dragon has proven to be extremely popular with local as well as visiting photographers .  It has also been the subject of numerous photo features among both the local and foreign media .  We also feel it is only fitting that the public should be given more opportunities to have their pictures taken with this most auspicious creature as we ushere in the Year of the Dragon and face the new challenges of the New Millennium , " the spokesman added .  
Immigration Officer , Mr Choi To , was commended for his outstanding leadership , awareness , interrogation techniques and relentless effort displayed in the course of investigation leading to the crackdown of a syndicate which arranged false employment contracts for foreign domestic helpers .  The crackdown also led to the imprisonment of ten involved immigration law offenders .  
I am confident that with an active financial market , a thriving tourist industry , enhanced foreign trade , the gathering momentum of technological developments as well as the momentous development of China 's forthcoming accession to the World Trade Organisation , we can be cautiously optimistic about the medium and long-term economic prospects of Hong Kong .

The salary of a locally born maid is about NT $ 20,000 , while the average for a foreign national is only about NT $ 15,000 , " points out an executive-level professional woman employed in a foreign corporation , who has hired both local and foreign-born help , " and besides , these days only middle aged grannies are willing to work as domestics in Taiwan , and they are very selective themselves , and have a lot of demands like vacation or raises . "  
In the 1960s the government struggled to obtain foreign exchange . Under a policy of forcefully pursuing industrial development , record numbers of trees were cut . In 1960 the Yuli Forest District Office was established , and the forest compartments upstream continued to send down such top-grade conifers as red spruce and cypress and such broad-leaved trees as the Nanmu and Formosan Michelia .  
In the era when " cutting trees for foreign exchange " was the principal aim of the Republic of China 's forest policy , the Yuli District Forest Office preserved a stand of 60 stout camphor trees by the middle stretches of the Chingshui River . As the only remaining virgin tract of stout camphors , which are broad-leafed trees native to Taiwan , the stand has today become an essential resource in an effort to return Chingshui River to its original ecology .  
There is tremendous pressure that accumulates from one year of studies being judged all at once , " says Chen Chuan-sheng , a third year doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering who is also an assistant teacher and responsible for helping Belgian students with their theses . It 's not only foreign students who , because of the language problem , are scared of the oral exams . The Belgians are terrorized by this decisive test too . "  
To each his strengths : Before economic reforms were implemented on the mainland , emphasis was placed on " standing on one 's own feet . " Hence , scientists were cut off from information about foreign technology and were forced to grope around in the dark . Yet in this way we gained some technological development experience , especially in a few specialized areas .  
Q : It is hard to escape the conclusion that in the past the government 's attitude toward the protection of foreign intellectual property rights has been " whether or not this is beneficial for us or harmful for us . " But this time Premier Hau Peitsun clearly stated that infringement of intellectual property rights is a kind of theft - - the perspective is already shifting from " gain or loss " to " right and wrong . "  
The best is yet to come ! Successful research on a stereo piano that has received the affirmation of a foreign piano manufacturer sounds exciting . But for Yang Tai-ho , who designed the stereo piano ten years ago and acquired a patent for it five years ago , it 's just one of 200 patents .  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Besides a strong legislature , with the development of democratic politics , various interest groups are both " numerous and vocal " with their opinions . For example , there were endless disputes over land acquisition and the proposed routes of transportation projects , which all affected the pace of the projects . This caused the foreign firms who were anxious to get their orders settled to have to wait off to the side chomping at the bit .  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
But when you look a little closer , the slightly bent back , the thinning hair , and the fingers , misshapen and arthritic from overwork , all unintentionally reveal the marks left on him by long and arduous effort and by the passage of time . God 's will : Thirty-two years . The time this foreign doctor has spent in Taiwan just happens to be same as that spent in his native land . "  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners . Tuo tea , a variety of Pu'er whose cakes are shaped like bowls , won gold medals two years running in contests held in Spain and Germany .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
With the recent rapid economic growth in Taiwan , political liberalization , and a successful switch to a more practical approach to foreign policy , the ROC 's international status has risen , and some of the reasons used in the past for obtaining foreign passports no longer exist .  
My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association . He thinks this must be an opinion held by some ROC citizens as a result of their own shortcomings - - their lack of poise or inability to communicate with foreign customs officers .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
Better than some , worse than others : From a document on which most foreign governments were loath to put their stamps ( issuing visas to ROC citizens on separate sheets of paper ) , to today 's highly esteemed darling of black marketeers and international thieves , the ROC passport has come a long way fast .  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
His chance finally came in June of that year when an injured foreign player for the Giants was put on the disabled list . This freed up a spot on the major league roster , and Lu filled it . " I did n't think I 'd play for a while after coming up , " Lu recalls , " and was caught by surprise when manager Wang Chen-chih put me in the starting lineup . "  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
He believes that one of the main reasons why Taiwan fell into the hands of foreign rulers for half a century of its modern history was that the island 's rich mineral deposits had aroused the greed of other nations .  
He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women . " This brought a sudden quiet , but many younger Hakka women silently approved of the professor 's comments .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
When they play matchmaker for unsuspecting foreign firms , they often introduce them to inefficient enterprises . In the end not only were mainland industries not saved from their doldrums , even the foreign businesses involved in cooperative investment were dragged down into the vortex , suffering greatly . Time to sink or swim " Now the way of thinking has changed , " Zhang Zhiqun explains .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest . Yet local private enterprises , which , like quails , are small in stature but large in number , have not been given the attention they deserve . They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
He was unexpectedly called back to China to attend to his mother 's burial , and found himself ground to a halt in Jimei for two years , not a particularly easy base for launching foreign ventures . Then surprisingly his father 's enterprise went bankrupt , squandered into a penniless state by his father 's second wife . Tan had no choice but to start from scratch , running a rice store and a pineapple factory .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
In the films , Bruce Lee played such roles as a student in a martial arts training school in one of the foreign concessions in the early years of the Republic of China , or a lonely Chinese expatriate going to Southeast Asia or the West to try and make a living . Faced with inevitable bullying and insults from Westerners and Japanese , he would endure their repeated taunts , suppressing his anger until he could yield no further and all his pent-up ire would burst out .  
In light of the current situation , the country will need professionals skilled in R &amp; D , foreign languages and simultaneous interpretation ; people who are possessed of an international perspective and are also familiar with the characteristics of international markets ; as well as practical personnel who have a good grasp of such aspects as finance , transportation , and communication in the operation of international business .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
In 1932 China 's Minister of Industry Kung Ta , a 72nd generation descendant of Confucius , presented them as a gift to the school of journalism . And since the lions crossed the wide ocean and settled down in this foreign land , new arrivals who set their eyes on them usually gain the warm feeling of bumping into old friends in a strange place .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
Although the intended targets of sanctions were countries that over-exploited resources held in international waters , the amendment included a provision to the effect that whenever the secretary of commerce or secretary of the interior learns of trade or other forms of exchange , by foreign nationals , that directly or indirectly harms international conservation programs for endangered or threatened species , they should submit certification of this fact to the president .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
One of his reasons for writing was to correct some misconceptions about Ming furniture , because " strictly speaking they [ the early foreign collectors ] were biased , for they neglected the fact that there is also a side to Ming furniture of fine carving and intricate decoration , which of course is quite different from the elaborate ornamentation of Qing dynasty palace-style furniture . "  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media . Based on prior experience ( 120 foreign reporters for the elections two years ago and 160 foreign reporters for the elections last year ) , Chen 's office estimated that about 250 personnel would arrive from abroad to cover the presidential race .  
Afterwards , they began to perform xiang sheng in Taiwanese . The first time , the story was about a foreign preacher inviting over a Taiwanese interpreter to help him deliver a big sermon . The humor of language misunderstanding was thus unveiled . For example , " Today I 've come to preach [ bodao ] in this honorable [ gui ] place " was interpreted as , " Today I come to this ghostly [ also pronounced gui ] place to spread rice shoots [ also pronounced bodao ] . "  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
In the late 1940s , the then bustling and cosmopolitan Shanghai rejoiced at having survived World War II relatively unscathed . But when the red tide of communism flooded through China , it marked the end for the city : foreign and Chinese entrepreneurs alike were swept out through its gates and their assets seized by the state .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
Even after you have graduated from university or graduate school , there are still all kinds of career-training buxibans that will help you cross over to a new profession , prepping you for the national civil service exam , TOEFL , overseas university entrance exams , qualifying licensing examinations , and even specialized tests for journalism or the foreign service .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
With the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the 1640s China once again fell under the rule of a foreign people . At this time the accomplished plum painter Shi Tao , whose prospects of a brilliant civil service career were dashed by the Qing conquest , wrote this poem to the plum flower : " The green mountains and bright moon are the same as they always were and will be .  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
" I 'll probably select paintings relatively Western in composition and in use of color , " says Yen Shen-jer , somewhat reluctantly . He notes that the classic Chinese ink painting artistic idiom , with its vivid moods , uninhibited yet subtle inks and impressionistic approach to nature , is not something that Westerners can simply understand at a glance . Therefore , in order to open doors for a foreign audience , it is necessary to make things accessible .  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
Southeast Asia and the mainland entice firms with their low production costs and their market potential . In addition , about 70% of the economic strength of the region is concentrated in the hands of Chinese business people who , in turn , are closely tied to Taiwanese business people . This drew many Taiwanese to the region more than 10 years ago , making them some of Southeast Asia 's earliest foreign investors .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
Recently Cardinal Shan has been promoting the establishment of a Catholic benevolent fund , and the strengthening of service to aboriginal people , foreign workers , the poor and ill , and those in prison . Moreover , the Taiwan Catholic Church is planning a major conference on " New Good News for the New Century , " to be held in 2000 , in the hope of helping Taiwan society as it adjusts to rapid change .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Lee Su Yue , herself having lived in a foreign land , has always been greatly touched by the story of the lonely and brokenhearted Wang Zhaojun , who was married out to a barbarian chieftain of the western hinterlands and buried in an alien country .  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
For example , Chang Ta-chun rejects the idea that My Kid Sister and Wild Child are representative of his oeuvre . These were selected for translation mainly because the themes were more comprehensible to a foreign audience . " My other works , " he explains , " are about events or are set against backdrops peculiar to China or Taiwan , and would n't be easy to translate , much less be accessible to most American readers . "  
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January . Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .  
When Sun wore a long jacket while shooting a music video , people could tell how excited she was at wearing a winter coat for the first time . At that moment , Taiwan did n't seem to be that far from Singapore , despite the latter 's endless summer weather . We all could sense a young woman 's joy at being accepted in foreign land that seemed at once familiar and exotic .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
The appeal of a divine being that loves all mankind did n't find a ready audience in Chinese who still had their original brush with the West-looking down the barrel of a gun-fresh in their memories ; people were suspicous of the relationship between Christian doctrine and economic interests ; and they got life-saving medicine side-by-side with life-destroying opium . People were not well educated and standards of living were low , so there was fear and prejudice against foreign culture .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
( Chang Chin-ju / tr . by Robert Taylor ) The APEC economic leaders ' meeting was concluded on 21 October . Regrettably , because Taiwan and this year 's host , mainland China , were unable to agree on Taiwan 's choice of representative , and because at a ministerial press conference prior to the leaders ' meeting PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan prevented ROC economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi from speaking , the ROC government decided to withdraw from the summit .  
Peter Kurz , CEO of the investment consulting firm Insight Pacific , observes that although Taiwan 's non-performing loan ratio is increasing , the amount for dishonored checks and bills has not correspondingly risen . " This indicates , " he explains " that the rise in the non-performance ratio is a result of the government 's increasingly strict oversight of the financial sector , and the increasing transparency of bank operations , which in fact are positive things from the point of view of foreign investors . "  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
The reason Anatomy of a Public Servant has been well received is that the author is perceptive and attentive to the smallest details , has clearly read widely , and is well acquainted with sayings , literary sketches , and anecdotes of renowned Chinese and foreign personalities . He handles his materials skillfully and provides his readers with highly informative footnotes written with a light touch .  
But social work postgraduate student Chen Chin-jung , who is writing her master 's dissertation about foreign brides , maintains that its more an exchange than a purchase . In her view both the Taiwanese bridegrooms and their foreign brides are seeking in the other an opportunity to fulfill a need of their own . The men want the opportunity to marry and start a family , while the women are seizing a chance to improve their standard of living and to better themselves . This makes each of them the best choice in the other 's eyes .  
Moreover , the residents of Tannan village have always supported themselves through farming and manual labor , but the nation 's current economic lull coupled with the presence of foreign labor has caused unemployment rates to increase steadily . The consequences of Typhoon Toraji last year , erosion , and the loss of arable land , have deepened the region 's economic turmoil , further impairing the prospects of reconstruction . At present , only five or six houses are under construction .  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
It was quite a story at the time . This 16-year-old Brazilian youth had already , at the age of 14 , won first prize on a Brazilian television quiz show , startling everybody with his rich knowledge of China . As a result , the ROC ambassador to Brazil , T.T . Li , noticed him , and eventually he was invited to visit the ROC by then-minister of education Chang Chi-yun and vice foreign minister Shen Chuang-huan . This event planted the seeds of a lifelong love for Chinese culture and for Taiwan .  
In contrast to its fellow " Little Dragons , " Taiwan 's economic policy has been waffling since 1997 . With so much still up in the air , foreign investors have been unwilling to put their money into Taiwan and local businesspeople have begun losing patience with the government 's dithering . Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of Taiwan 's economic outlook is that government and industry are headed in opposite directions and the distance between them is growing .  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
The amendments also relax the rules for granting permanent residency to the foreign spouses and children of Taiwan-resident ROC citizens . The basic requirement of five years ' continuous residency is unchanged , but the alternative requirement of being resident in Taiwan for 183 days in eight of the last 15 years is reduced to 183 days in five of the last ten years .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
Under the WTO regime , Japan again lost in arbitration over complaints brought by foreign countries . WTO rulings are more enforceable , so within 15 months of the ruling Japan raised taxes on sake and somewhat lowered tariffs on imports of hard liquor . Nonetheless , by hemming and hawing , Japan put off raising taxes on sake for more than a decade .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy . In fact , this issue has caused a number of foreign manufacturers to close their operations in Taiwan and to relocate to mainland China .  
Wufeng is the leading producer of these in Taiwan , with more than 40 growers cultivating a large range of varieties including the enoki ( or enokitake ) , of which Wufeng is one of the world 's leading sources . The ROC government has been encouraging the growing of edible mushrooms since as far back as the immediate post-WWII period . Wufeng has played a leading role in the development of mushrooms as an economic crop in Taiwan , and has earned a considerable amount of foreign exchange in the process .  
She confidently points out that her own English pronunciation is accurate , and she is capable of leading classroom activities , knows how to prepare a curriculum , and understands the background of local students . On the other hand , " foreign teachers are n't necessarily superior instructors because they do n't have experience teaching Taiwanese students , and they are n't as sensitive to the kinds of linguistic difficulties that Taiwanese students encounter , " Lu says .  
In addition to private entrepreneurs abandoning their hide-bound attitudes and moving forward hand in hand to develop the market , the Executive Yuan 's plan to double the number of foreign tourists was already on track last year with an estimated investment over the next six years of almost NT $ 80 billion and a yearly target for visitors to Taiwan in 2003 and beyond of three million , up from 2.6 million of previous years .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
" There are some battered foreign brides who loathe Taiwanese and think all Taiwanese are evil , and even distrust the social workers themselves , " says Vietnamese-born Sister Mei of the Good Shepherd Sisters . Current law stipulates that even foreign brides who have legal residence must return home if they get divorced , without the possibility of taking their children with them . This last point is very difficult to bear and they frequently feel the social workers are unwilling to help them .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
In her first and second years in university she tried to transfer to the department of foreign languages . In her senior year she began taking courses at a supplementary school to prepare for the exam to enter graduate school to study foreign relations . Although she was thwarted in each of these three attempts to advance toward her dream , she is still working hard now to save money to go abroad to approach it from a fresh angle .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
He says that at present , unclear policies and sporadic services result in serious problems such foreign wives failing to adjust well to their surroundings , domestic violence , children doing poorly in school , and bogus marriages that are actually a cover for prostitution . According to Lin , the government urgently needs to address the growing social problems and costs arising from transnational marriages .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
Hungary is a small nation that al-ways held itself aloof from the rest of the world , but was also plagued by countless calamities , and was time and again " liberated " by foreign nations . After the great catastrophe of the Tatar ( Mongol ) invasion , Hungary enjoyed several centuries of peace and growth . In the 16th century , the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary , and occupied it for 150 years . The Turks left a historical legacy of Turkish baths and Byzantine architecture , which remain to this day . . . .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .  
Victor Chang sums it up this way : " In the past , Taiwan 's real estate market was ailing , so , just as an ill person takes medicine , a restorative tonic was applied , consisting of preferential home loans , halved land value increment tax , and foreign investment . Close examination should reveal whether the market has improved as a result of the treatment . "  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe . Unfortunately , due to the fact that at the time accessing relevant information was problematic , he did not scrutinize foreign patents and applied only for a domestic patent , with the result that this patent was later challenged and overturned by Nike .

ukrainian foreign minister anatoly alenko in his written speech at the meeting said ukraine posed no nuclear threat to europe for the buttons of the nuclear weapons were controlled by russia ukraine was only waiting for a " safe environment "  
last saturday , boueiz announced that foreign ministers of arab countries participating in the bilateral peace talks will meet here on the first two days of april to assess the outcome of the previous talks and coordinate positions on the mideast peace process before the next round of talks  
The economic crises in the developing world have been greatly aggravated : unemployment and economic stagnation have been compounded by persisting problems in international trade , by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials .  
Most of them are facing the challenges of globalization with economies made uniquely vulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness , their precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable international economic environment .  
The international community 's commitment to sustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced by encouraging increased direct foreign investment , as well as an increased international transfer of financial resources to the region .  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
The Committee further reaffirmed that the activities of foreign economic , financial and other interests operating at present in the colonial Territories constituted a major obstacle to political independence and racial equality .  
However , the continent must be the beneficiary of , inter alia , a major reduction in its debt burden , the elimination of obstacles to its exports , vigorous foreign investments and increasing international assistance better adapted to national policies .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
A number of delegations addressed the issue of the continued growth of foreign direct investment in the world economy in the context of expected recovery in world economic performance and growth and continuing structural changes in the world economy .  
To the extent that foreign direct investment frameworks became similar , other factors assumed great significance ; these included appropriate legal framework good governance , and a stable political and sound macroeconomic environment .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
In developing the mineral sector and increasing its attractiveness to foreign investors , information regarding all laws , regulations , mineral potential , support services , the ability of the skilled workforce , and key government contacts is essential .  
Political , regulatory , investment , fiscal , environmental and monetary issues have emerged as significant in encouraging direct foreign investment in mineral exploration .  
Moreover , as a composite of banking institutions central , republican and provincial it was responsible for carrying out common currency issue , credit and foreign exchange policy , and it had close institutional relations with Parliament .  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
A number of seminars and discussion forums intended for large audiences were organized , aiming to enhance popular understanding of foreign direct investment , its developmental potential , and the relevant policy issues .  
Creating the legal , economic , and social conditions conducive to domestic investment has also proved to be effective in attracting foreign investment .  
The meeting urged subregional and regional banking / financial institutions to channel the greater part of their resources towards the private sector , creating indigenous capital markets , rather than depend on the existing ones controlled by foreign interests .  
Having considered the item entitled " Activities of foreign economic and other interests which are impeding the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in Territories under colonial domination and efforts to eliminate colonialism , apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa " ,  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The basic coordinate of Slovakia 's foreign policy is its integration into the geopolitical and economic sphere with which we not only have numerous historical ties , but also and , I think , more importantly with which we share the same hierarchy of modern civilized values .  
At the same time , we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy , free from foreign interference , must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development .  
Along with reform in all aspects of social life , Viet Nam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broad openness , the thrust of which is to diversify and multilateralize its external relations in order to create a stable environment and external conditions conducive to the task of building and defending the country , and to enhance Viet Nam 's position on the international scene .  
The achievements of its foreign policy provide a new impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process of regional and global integration , and to participate more effectively in global forums and institutions , with a view to tackling the pressing problems facing all mankind , and to contributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of the international community to achieve peace , national independence , friendship , cooperation among States and development .  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
However , despite these endeavours and despite my Government 's resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for our people on a firm foundation , foreign interests , for their own unavowed purposes , want to see the democratic process in my country shaped as the saying is in the image and likeness of those alien interests .  
In 1992 the Cuban Parliament approved a constitutional amendment which modified existing laws in respect of the Cuban State 's acknowledgement of property rights , the rights of joint ventures , and economic associations with foreign capital investments .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
The difficulties besetting African countries are still present : the crushing burden of external debt , the steady deterioration of the terms of trade , the scant inflow of resources and direct foreign investment and the continued degradation of the environment because of the growing , interrelated pressures of the population and poverty .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
In the case of foreign military installations , we did hear some comments to the effect that the military installations were an important factor in local employment and the local economic situation , and that because of the decision to close or downsize some of them there were adverse consequences that some of the Territories were unable to face without adequate cooperation from the administering Powers . 
One of those beautiful pages was written when , on the heels of an intensive campaign of work done by all sectors throughout our society , with the support of the international community and led mainly by this Committee , the then United States President , Jimmy Carter , granted an unconditional pardon to our national heroes who were then still jailed in the United States for their action against foreign dominion .  
As members know , the working papers prepared by the Secretariat inform us that the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are developing successfully and thus moving towards self-determination only where there has been the active involvement of foreign economic entities through substantial foreign investment .  
We see nothing controversial about requesting the administering Powers not to violate the Charter by exploiting the natural resources of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories or in any way subordinating their rights and interests to foreign economic and financial interests .  Is it really wrong to urge these Powers to ensure that acceptable working conditions prevail in these Territories ?  
An end to military rivalry , foreign occupation and feelings of racial superiority would be conducive to a world free of poverty and injustice , in which relationships would become more democratic , humane and stable .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , summary and arbitrary executions , disappearances , arbitrary detentions , all forms of racism , racial discrimination and apartheid , foreign occupation and alien domination , xenophobia , poverty , hunger and other denials of economic , social and cultural rights , religious intolerance , terrorism , discrimination against women and lack of the rule of law .  
The conflict broke out because , contrary to the provisions on the consensus of the three constituent peoples of the Constitution of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina , and with the support of foreign entities , attempts were made to impose the concept of unitary constitutional order under which the Serb people would become a national minority and be forced to live under Muslim domination . 
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
The Presidents have confirmed the policy of close interaction between Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation in the field of foreign policy , bearing in mind the harmonization of positions on principal international and regional problems of mutual interest and the coordination of action in the United Nations , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international organizations .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
This genocide , which was perpetrated with the support of foreign pro-imperialist forces , was an exceptionally brutal part of a deliberate plan of aggression pursued by the Armenian aggressors against the independent Azerbaijani State ; it was an unprecedented act of vandalism and has been recorded in the history of the twentieth century as a crime against all humanity .  
Reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence , territorial integrity , national unity and for liberation from colonial and foreign domination , and for the establishment of a society in which people , irrespective of race , colour or creed , will fully enjoy economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights on a basis of equality and participate freely in the determination of their destiny ,  
Stressing that , as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , [ 2 ] / family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration , and that financial remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind ,  
Also expresses grave concern about the outrages committed by the outlawed Khmer Rouge , including the massacre of approximately fifty villagers in Battambang Province in October 1994 , the numerous recent incidents of kidnapping of villagers , the taking and killing of foreign hostages and other deplorable incidents detailed in the report of the Special Representative ;  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Established in 1988 , the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) promotes foreign direct investment for economic and social development in borrowing member countries by guaranteeing investments against political risks , helping countries to create an attractive investment climate and providing promotional and advisory services .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , are a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Industrialization , which was essential for diversifying the production base and generating employment opportunities , especially for a rapidly growing urban population , required adopting measures to create an environment conducive to private investment , both domestic and foreign ;  
It was considered that good governance , including accountability and transparency , a sound and stable macroeconomic policy framework , consistent and effective policies for reform and structural adjustment , taking into account the social dimension , creation of favourable conditions for market-oriented development and foreign direct investment were equally critical to success ;  
Governments designed and directed credit programmes , controlled interest rates , limited the access of its citizens to foreign currencies , restricted the access of foreigners and maintained fixed exchange rates .  
The structural reforms undertaken in the banking sector centred on privatizing State-owned banks , reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and foreign private banks , liberalizing the types of activities that banks could undertake and , concomitantly , improving the prudential regulation of financial institutions .  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
Seven non-recurrent publications . ( i ) Guide on the role of banks in financing east-west trade ; ( ii ) guide for foreign investors on property laws in countries in transition ; ( iii ) survey on recent trends in foreign direct investment in central and eastern Europe ( 2 ) ; ( iv ) guide to management training in countries in transition ; ( v ) promoting the expansion of trade of countries in transition ; and ( vi ) expanding trade and investment cooperation among countries in transition . 
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
Seminars and workshops on the functions and impact of international , regional and bilateral arrangements ; country experience studies ; harmonization of foreign direct investment reporting systems ; incorporation of sustainable development management practices into national policies ; and enhancement of national strategies for sustainable development as they relate to transnational corporations .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
A prior requirement , however , would be the removal by individual countries of the range of impediments that currently limit intraregional capital flows , including foreign-exchange controls , legislation and regulations , that discriminate against foreign investors , restrictions on transfers and other direct and indirect measures designed to influence capital flows .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
It urges genuine cooperation among all States in the framework of international legitimacy so that the necessary measures may be taken to prevent and combat terrorism and eliminate its causes , and it calls for the formulation of internationally acceptable criteria to differentiate clearly between terrorism , which must be condemned and opposed , and national struggle against foreign occupation , which must be protected and supported .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .  
Capital has become more mobile than ever across the world , owing to a combination of policies that encourage foreign investment in many developing economies with the rapid advance in computer-based telecommunication technology ; and the growth in the size of institutional investors ( mutual funds , pension funds , and so on ) .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
If differences among countries ' living standards are the focus of the comparison , then a purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate is regarded as the most appropriate method , as it values the commodities and services sold in each country at a set of common international prices , rather than at local prices multiplied by the value of the national currency determined in the foreign exchange market .  
Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced , wars of aggression , armed conflicts , colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation , civil wars , terrorism and [ extremist violence ] continue to plague many parts of the world .  
They range from alleged threats to the national security of the sender State and the alleged violation of agreed international norms and instruments by the target State , to expressions of dislike for specific domestic or foreign policies of the target State or more generally for the political and socio-economic system of the target State .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
Alongside this discrimination in hiring , in some countries there are legislative and regulatory provisions prohibiting foreigners from engaging in certain occupations or limiting their number , reflecting in some cases the fear of foreign influence in areas supposed to be sensitive but more often a desire to protect the economic activity of nationals against foreign competition , or , in other words , protectionist concerns .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
It should give participants access to a comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law enforcement , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills .  
They receive the label " untrustworthy " , which effectively bars them from engaging in professional or technical work and blocks their access to administrative posts or positions of responsibility or employment in a foreign firm , even though their qualifications and skills may make them ideal candidates for the job .  
Cuba is not immune to the ideological effect of institutions such as self-employment , the agricultural and livestock market and , on another scale , foreign enterprises , with the concomitant national and foreign businessmen connected with the mixed import and export economy .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
The tangible benefits of this work were : increased quality production of salt ; enhanced income generation for rural women ; training and better information through the provision of simple technology ; and the use of solar evaporation methods leading to less deforestation and saving of foreign exchange when salt did not need to be imported .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
The estimated measurable loss on the basis of the unrealized social product , as well as of the unrealized net inflow of invisible transactions with foreign countries , and on the basis of the additional costs of the increased number of unemployed persons and refugees is US $ 147.3-billion for the entire 1991-2011 period - US $ 45.1-billion for the period 1991-1994 and US $ 102.2-billion for the period 1995-2011 . 
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
In the case of the United States government employee assigned or posted to a foreign area , the base pay is augmented by living quarters allowance , post allowance , post differential , danger pay , and other allowances , as applicable .  
By the middle of 1990 , the First Group , with continued foreign assistance , had developed designs and had fabricated and tested a small series of prototype centrifuge machines incorporating carbon fibre rotors and magnetic bearings , the final version of which had a demonstrated capacity of the order of 2 kg separative work units ( SWU ) per year .  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
that , as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , [ 25 ] / held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration , and that remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind ,  
of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;

To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
The State was typical of the nineteenth century : a judge and gendarme liberal State assuming the essential duties of national defence , internal security , foreign relations , basic financial activity and justice .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
On the other hand , the Government was faced with crippling obstacles , in the form of a treasury that had been emptied and swept clean by the ousted regime ; the threat from regrouped elements of the defeated army of the former regime ; a completely decimated public service ; and interference by hostile foreign Governments associated with the defeated former regime .  
Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
It is astonishing to note that the Government and people of Lebanon , who are fighting to liberate their territory from prolonged foreign occupation an inherent and inalienable right recognized by international law and enshrined in the United Nations Charter are called upon to give up their right to self-defence and hence submit to aggression , occupation , and non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
We are still concerned about the ongoing , complex and uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from the Transdniester region .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints faced by various developed countries , clarification of foreign aid objectives , revised conditions governing the granting of assistance , and the heightened competition among various regions for aid packages constitute a serious challenge for developing countries such as mine .  
A world free of colonialism , foreign occupation and aggression , and protected from the threat of racial hegemony , expansionism or colonization is the necessary precursor of a world free of poverty , injustice and oppression , in which relations are more democratic , humane , secure and stable for the well-being of one and all .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
It faces daunting problems , including civil strife , a large foreign debt , increasing populations dependent on decreasing amounts of usable land , and an inadequate flow of investment .  
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
The objectives of the Community , as defined in the Treaty of Chaguaramas inter alia , economic cooperation through the Caribbean Common Market ; coordinated foreign policies ; and creating joint services in such essential sectors as health , education , culture , communications and industrial relations have been methodically pursued through the establishment of appropriate Community structures by its member States . 
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
At their annual meetings in 1996 , foreign ministers both of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 called for the immediate elimination of all forms of coercive economic measures with negative , extraterritorial impact on the development of developing countries and which undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law and the free flow of trade and investment .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
As a representative of Poland , a country that has suffered so much war , foreign occupation and partition in its history of more than 1,000 years , I feel entitled to convey a simple message : peace is priceless , be it international , with other countries , or internal , among social partners . 
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Whatever their geographical scope , however , issues such as depletion of natural resources , declining food production , and declining availability and quality of water were linked with issues such as income generation , literacy , health care , unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the developed world , privatization and the effects of structural adjustment programmes , international trade patterns , and the foreign debt burden .  
In his latest report , the Secretary-General informed the Security Council , inter alia , that , subsequent to the visits by a number of foreign dignitaries and the adoption of Council resolution 1045 ( 1996 ) , there had been positive developments during February 1996 , including a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations , a further reduction in hostile propaganda , the release of additional prisoners , the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions and the continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
The aim is clear : it is to punish Cuba for seeking tenaciously to determine freely , sovereignly and independently its own political , economic and social organization ; for securing for its people a future of justice , free from foreign interference and petty interests such as those which , for more than 60 years , controlled the country under the protection of United States .  
These were cases in which an official received a gift from a representative of a foreign Government on the occasion of an official visit to the country concerned , if he or she received a gift from a community organization on a social occasion where the gift represented the work or an achievement of that organization ; or if he or she received a gift from other officers in the service on the occasion of his or her marriage , retirement , transfer or other celebratory occasion , if the present was approved by the Commissioner .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
Rather than the initial very simple structure of a pure equity investment by an individual foreign investor where risk was self insured , a number of joint venture investments have concluded and have been structured to include a mix of equity and non-recourse project debt , with insurance provided by either private or agency insurers .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Those amendments also introduced a requirement for banks and special financial institutions to report to the competent authorities all transfers abroad of Turkish lira and foreign currency exceeding US $ 50,000 or its equivalent , except in the case of exports , imports and invisible transactions .  
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
The policies announced by the Government included a halt to the printing of money , a reduction in the excessive amounts of money in circulation , increases in the charges on government-provided goods and services , the sale of some government assets , and a relaxation of the restrictions on foreign exchange trading by allowing official exchange houses to trade at rates comparable with those available on the parallel market , as well as by allowing Iraqis living abroad to transfer funds to their relatives in Iraq .  
To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
He also stressed that the establishment of an independent economy and sustainable economic development would necessarily require a diversified production base , free trade relations with Israel and the transformation from dependency on exporting the labour force to production and exports to foreign markets .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .  
Other countries like Benin , Ethiopia and Senegal , which experienced a severe decline in foreign direct investment during the previous decade , have managed to arrest and even reverse this trend as a result of reforms and with the advent of an encouraging economic outlook .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;

Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
They are based on the concept of direct ( impact on the balance of payments ) , indirect and additional losses and include the methods of evaluating losses declared by Bulgarian economic entities , of analysis and simulation of foreign trade with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the country 's balance of payments ( trade in goods and services ) as well as the method of expert analysis by line ministries .  
The experience he has acquired over eight years prompts the Special Rapporteur to assert that situations involving , for example , armed conflict , terrorism , or violence linked to extremist intolerance foster a growing reliance on the use of mercenaries , which for our purposes means seeking out foreign experts who are paid for services of destructive violence and deadly effectiveness .  
Any State that expropriates , nationalizes or takes measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization of property owned by foreign nationals must respect the following rules : such action must be for a public purpose , non-discriminatory , and accompanied by prompt , adequate and effective compensation , granting to the expropriated party effective administrative or judicial review of the measure and quantum of compensation .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
Contributing to this improvement were the slight deceleration of inflation ( as of July 1996 , 17.6 per cent on an annual basis ) ; increase in available foreign exchange owing to a growing number of visitors , both Haitians living abroad and foreigners ; and strengthening of the gourde resulting from the inflow of foreign currency by bilateral or multilateral donors to finance public investments .  
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
At the governmental level , the exercise of power in what were certainly crucial moments for the future of the country was gathered in the hands of the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defence and the National Security Council , while the other ministers in the Government were barely kept informed of Burundi 's request for foreign security assistance made at the 25 June Arusha Summit and supported by the Yaound Summit a dozen or so days later . 
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated the continued validity of the fundamental right of all peoples to self-determination , the exercise of which , in the case of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation , is essential to ensure the eradication of all those situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State in which proceeding the asset and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court or other competent authority , for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation [ provided that the debts were not incurred predominantly for household or other personal rather than commercial purposes ] ;  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
While agreeing with the principle that a foreign representative should be given the right to commence actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to creditors ( sometimes referred to as Paulian actions ) , the Working Group considered that it would be preferable to delete the reference to them in subparagraph ( b ) ( v ) .  
Employers found guilty of abusing domestic workers were liable to heavy sentences , including jail terms and corporal punishment , and were permanently barred from employing foreign domestic workers in the future .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
Mr . BAALI ( Algeria ) said that the origin of the dramatic events currently taking place in the world lay , even more than in colonialism and the disintegration of communism , in the resurgence of violence provoked by the exacerbation of nationalistic , ethnic , religious and tribal sentiments and fed by foreign intervention . 
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
In her country 's view , the right to self-determination meant the right of peoples to free themselves from colonialist oppression or foreign occupation , in accordance with the position stated by the Organization of African Unity that the colonial borders of African States should be left unaltered to avoid the risks of disintegration of the States concerned , the encouragement of insurrection and the disruption of international peace and security . 
What is particularly lacking in terms of raising domestic competition and increasing the competitiveness of economies in transition is a sufficient number of privately owned medium-sized enterprises capable of growing and competing not only in domestic markets but also in foreign markets .  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Under that decree , a committee chaired by the prefect , and composed of men of religion and eminent Greek Muslim citizens , is responsible for proposing to the Minister of Education and Worship a list of qualified persons ( who must , in particular , be holders of a university degree from a school of advanced Islamic studies , whether Greek or foreign , or persons who have performed functions as an imam for at least 10 years and who have distinguished themselves by their morality and theological competence ) .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Training camps for foreign Muslim extremists , originally intended for the organization of violent actions outside the Sudan , were now being used , owing to the weakening of the State and to international pressure , for domestic repression alien to local Islamic traditions .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
He wondered why the United States Government used double standards , accusing some countries of human rights violations , while turning a blind eye to those committed by some of its allies and ignoring the thousands of political detainees and shielding the killing of unarmed women and children and the occupation of foreign territory as it made use of its veto .  
Thus the decisive impact of transport efficiency on countries ' competitiveness and their ability to attract foreign direct investment is obvious : since the annual cost of international maritime transport was estimated at US $ 250-billion in 1994 ( half of which being incurred in ports ) , a 5 per cent reduction in port and transport costs could save traders some US $ 12.5-billion per annum .  
The limited organizational capacity of many local transport providers - particularly undersized freight forwarders , who with proper assistance might develop into efficient multimodal transport operators - is leaving many countries too dependent on foreign transport providers . 
With regard to racial discrimination , his delegation naturally condemned racial violence , xenophobia and racism , but could not accept a failure to take account of the flagrant violations of the rights of peoples represented by colonialism , foreign occupation , genocide , ethnic cleansing , and the hatred voiced of Arabs , Africans , Asians and the peoples of Latin America , all issues which were not broached in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance . 
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
In the following days , shots were fired at the main police station of the capital , the Parliament and the National Television building and , on 20 August , two MDN leaders were assassinated .  The leaders of one opposition party alleged that the Government was involved , while the press quoted foreign officials who implicated the Presidential Security Unit .  
The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
His delegation supported in part the approach followed by the Commission in its previous sessions , namely , to retain only those crimes whose gravity could not easily be contested , as well as crimes of a clearly political nature which posed a threat to international peace and security and therefore to exclude crimes , such as piracy , trafficking in women and children , racial discrimination , recruitment of mercenaries and foreign intervention .  
The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan , which has become a basic strategic principle of its foreign policy , is the most acceptable approach for Turkmenistan in pursuing its national interests and is in keeping with the country 's historical , geopolitical and ethno-cultural realities .  
It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
According to article 31 , such law includes Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , in which the Security Council determined , acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations , as a result of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
In the context of the discussion of article 14 , a proposal was made to include a new paragraph in article 14 providing that recognition of a foreign proceeding should be granted only to such limited effects as were consistent with the purposes of ensuring coordination of proceedings under the provisions ( yet to be formulated ) on coordination between a pending main proceeding in the enacting State and a subsequent application for recognition of a foreign main or non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
It was proposed that , within the context of article 15 ( 1 ) , the powers of the foreign representative or other person designated by the court should be limited to measures destined to preserve three categories of assets : perishable assets , assets susceptible of devaluation and assets otherwise in jeopardy , such as where there was an imminent danger of their being concealed or dissipated .  
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .  
In its foreign relations , Viet Nam will constantly pursue an open foreign policy of independence , diversification and the promotion of multilateral relations along the line of gradual regional and international integration , thus making worthy contributions to the cause of peace , national independence , democracy and social progress .  
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
These are the facts about the bellicose , obstinate , rejectionist and intransigent attitude of the Taliban , which is aided and assisted by the presence of agents of the cross-border military intelligence services and attested to by the physical presence of foreign military and paramilitary prisoners in Afghanistan .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
It has the intention of continuing the dialogue initiated there on a number of bilateral issues , including trade , which is in perfect agreement with our foreign policy agenda , which will seek , after overcoming our internal armed confrontation , to pursue a better understanding and strengthening of our international relations , thus contributing to a better understanding among peoples , including a brighter future for China and Guatemala . I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council . 
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
However , the view was also expressed that , for those legal systems where the words " to intervene " were not well understood , those words might be given a different interpretation , and in particular that they might carry the meaning that the foreign representative might substitute for the debtor in judicial actions .  
A view was expressed that , as an alternative to the enumeration of the grounds on which recognition might be refused , the Model Provisions could contain a definition of the effects limited to coordination and cooperation , to be granted to the recognized foreign proceeding when a local proceeding is already pending in the enacting State .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
Observing scientifically the changes in the international situation , Mr . Deng Xiaoping led us in the reshaping of an international strategy adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace , safeguarding world peace , promoting world development and opposing hegemonism and power politics , thus opening up a new situation in China 's relations with foreign countries in a new era , and making historic contributions to developing and strengthening China 's friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
It was stated that , in assessing the trustworthiness of a foreign certificate , the recipient of a digitally signed message accompanied by the certificate should consider a number of questions , such as the following : whether the certification authority issuing the certificate was authorized to act abroad ; whether the digital signature of the certification authority was authentic ; whether legal recourse was available against the certification authority ; whether the digital signature had been recognized to produce legal effects ; and whether the digital signature could be enforced against its author .  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
However , the concern was voiced that , when read in conjunction with draft article B , which required such prior approval for certification authorities established in the enacting State , paragraph ( 1 ) might be read as allowing the recognition of certificates issued by foreign certification authorities which had not been authorized to operate under domestic rules , while denying legal effectiveness to certificates issued by domestic certification authorities that had not received the required authorization in the enacting State .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .

Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development , and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .

The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
As for trade statistics , the mission focused attention on : ( i ) ascertaining the technical capabilities and work plan of the PCBS with regard to the compilation , processing , analysis , and dissemination of Palestinian foreign trade statistics ; ( ii ) identifying the nature and extent of needs of the PCBS for technical assistance in the area of international trade statistics ; and , ( iii ) developing relevant proposals for manpower training .  
These should provide in particular protection of contractual agreements and an even playing field between domestic and foreign investors ( therefore preventing discrimination against foreign investors ) , and policy formulation should be consistent and well planned so that partial reversals or inconsistent legislation are not implemented later .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .

One State19 reported that legislative amendments had been made to allow for proper control over foreign entertainers , while another20 noted that women migrant workers in the private sector were provided with the same rights as male migrant workers , as well as additional benefits , such as maternity leave and child protection .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
The discussions will be videotaped and the taped footage will be utilized to produce a one-hour course on international law which will be distributed , subject to financial constraints , to schools , universities , research institutions , parliamentarians and foreign ministries to promote both knowledge and understanding of international law and international relations .

With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development . performance and the unexploited opportunities available . 
On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .  The Chinese Government adheres to Mr . Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on diplomatic endeavours and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
While the formulation of common standards for prudential oversight and management of risk situations and efforts to involve developing countries and countries with transition economies were welcome , States remained responsible for the establishment of a stable and predictable national environment for foreign investment .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign portfolio equity investment flows .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies , including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development .  
The speaker listed several issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( iv ) trade in services .  
The speaker listed a number of issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) debt burden ; ( iv ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( v ) trade in services .  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .  
In 1994 , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , the Special Committee had recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
In 1994 , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , the Special Committee had recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
The outcome of our recently held parliamentary elections has confirmed that this basic orientation of our foreign policy will remain unchanged and is supported by the overwhelming majority of the Polish people . 
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Lastly , with regard to the question of foreign debt , there is now broad agreement that without favourable treatment for the stock of African debt , particularly in the most heavily indebted countries , no economic recovery programme can produce the desired long-term positive effects .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
On 21 September 1996 , the Vice-President of SLORC , Gen . Maung Aye , is reported to have declared that the military could remain in power longer if elements receiving foreign support caused disorder and on 25 September 1996 , the NLM indicated that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would soon be charged with political crimes as she was conspiring with former colonial powers and aiding exiled dissident groups in a plot to overthrow the Government .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
Heavier penalties may be applied under other statutes for acquiring a passport or another travel document in an unlawful manner by providing false information or intentionally concealing facts or contributing to incorrect information on official documents ; acquiring more than one passport or travel document for an unlawful purpose ; altering or removing parts of official travel documents for an unlawful purpose ; entering or exiting the country without reporting to passport control authorities ; or taking part in the concealment of a foreign national .  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of the present Declaration ;  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .  
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
In its resolution 1992 / 50 on the fraudulent or unlawful enrichment of top State officials , the Commission on Human Rights pointed clearly to the responsibility of the North in connection with the commission of that crime in the countries of the South and thus raised the question , still unclear in international law , of the restitution to despoiled peoples , for reinvestment in local economic , social and cultural development , of the funds which their leaders have extorted from them , usually with the complicity of foreign banks .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Warren Marik has acknowledged that considerable sums of money , at least $ 100-million , were swallowed up by these efforts , just as he has acknowledged the role played by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee in mounting a secret action against the legitimate authorities of Iraq and preparing a programme of aggression against Iraq to topple the regime in power , despite the duplicitous statements by senior United States Administration officials to the effect that they would not use such heinous procedures against foreign Heads of State .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
They shall promote the harmonization of their countries ' national legislation on combating organized transnational crime and terrorism , including illegal trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors , explosives and other hazardous materials , hijacking of motor transport , counterfeiting , money-laundering , crime in the area of foreign economic and banking transactions and taxation , and illegal migration and illegal crossing of borders .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
She was disappointed and alarmed at the continuing real decline in official development assistance over the past four years and the overwhelming concentration of foreign direct investment in only a handful of countries .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign-portfolio-equity investment flows .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
Specific procedural and legal problems include identification of , and communication with , the proper domestic authorities whose consent is required before boarding a foreign ship , the inability to exercise jurisdiction over domestic vessels or nationals outside territorial waters , and the inability to exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
He urged the international community to increase direct foreign investment , especially in Africa , as it was insufficient despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by the developing countries in order to create a favourable economic environment . 
His Government attached great significance to regional economic development and had declared Rajin-Sonbong a free trade zone with a view to creating a favourable environment for foreign investment , supported by relevant legislation .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
One was to reject everything that was foreign , on the reasoning that each countrys situation was unique and that external influences tended to be irrelevant at best or to undermine local uniqueness and cultural identity at worst .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
Globally , ODA has fallen to just 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996 the lowest level since foreign aid was institutionalized with the Marshall Plan about 50 years ago .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The high level of unhedged private external debt made the option of devaluing the baht a painful choice that was avoided until foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted in defending the exchange rate .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , it was essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
With a view to fostering participation of foreign companies and maximizing competition , the contracting authority may wish to cause the invitations to the preselection proceedings to be published also in a language customarily used in international trade , in a newspaper of wide international circulation or in a relevant trade publication or technical or professional journal of wide international circulation .  
International investment agreements ( IIAs ) have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment with a view to attracting foreign direct investment which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved .  
Most IIAs _ and particularly BITs _ have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment , with a view towards promoting and protecting foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved . 
In cases where the definition of investment is circumscribed to foreign direct investment only , this has been defined by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as international investment that reflects the objective of a resident entity in one economy obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
From Argentina to Ghana , State intervention in the economy has been drastically curtailed , protectionist barriers to Northern imports have been eliminated wholesale , restrictions on foreign investment have been lifted and , through export-first policies , internal economies have been more tightly integrated into the capitalist world market dominated by transnational corporations .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
Force was especially demonstrated through demands that an " international military presence " , meaning foreign troops , be accepted even before a political settlement was reached , although the scope and character of international presence had been defined in the agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
To counter the perceived threat and build a " clean social system " , 2 the regime launched a uniquely thorough revolution whereby all pre-existing economic , social and cultural institutions were abolished , all foreign influences were expunged and the entire population was transformed into a collective workforce , required to work at breakneck speed to build up the country 's economic strength .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
In its resolution 1193 ( 1998 ) of 28 August 1998 , the Security Council identified a further relevant factor when it noted the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in Afghanistan , including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict , such interference continued unabated .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .  
The latter has , moreover , called for the convening of an international conference to define terrorism , to elaborate internationally acceptable criteria for differentiating between terrorism and national struggle for liberation from foreign occupation and to study the underlying causes of acts of violence that stem from the violation of basic human rights , misery , frustration , a sense of grievance and despair .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Decides to consider at its fifty _ sixth session the question of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self _ determination under the agenda item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation . 
The secretariat also provides or requests high quality and timely information to and from ministries of foreign affairs , permanent missions to the United Nations , organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , and other international organizations , on a wide range of legal and technical issues related to the functions and decisions of the Commission and other United Nations legislative bodies on drug control .  
Provision and receipt of higher quality and more timely information to / from ministries of foreign affairs , permanent missions to the United Nations , organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and other international organizations on a wide range of legal and technical issues related to the functions and decisions of the Commission and other United Nations legislative bodies on drug control ;  
While a critical analysis of the contribution of the 20 / 20 initiative to the promotion of basic social services was urged , interested parties also underscored that the initiative leads to the combination of efforts of both donors and recipients of aid in a most visible way , matching domestic funds with an equal amount of foreign financial resources .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
It is imperative that the Security Council take urgent measures to condemn most strongly and to halt the NATO aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , an independent , sovereign country and a founding Member State of the United Nations and to request the withdrawal of foreign forces built up by NATO at the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , threatening thereby to escalate the aggression .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
Along with the consolidation of the democratic process , the country is yielding satisfactory and encouraging rates of economic growth , as reflected in the growth of the GDP , control of inflation , stability of the national currency , increase in foreign investment and gradual improvement in the living conditions of the people .  
Other sources of technology transfer such as licensing , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) leading to joint ventures , original equipment manufacturing ( OEM ) and other subcontracting arrangements serve a dual purpose , providing rapid access to technology as well as access to global markets .  
This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
For the information of the Sub-Commission , the secretariat has also prepared ( annex II ) a list of country situations currently being considered by the Commission under the agenda items entitled Organization of the work of the session , The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights . the occupied Arab territories ,  
This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
Rodolfo Stavenhagen states that the entire population of the Americas decreased by 95 per cent in the century and a half following the first encounter .  10 / The intent to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity and bring them under the sovereignty of foreign monarchs created widespread havoc , despite some early attempts at friendly treatment .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations has removed some important obstacles to transit trade , also enabling private sector transport operators in many landlocked and transit developing countries to retain some hard currency for purchase of spare parts and equipment .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .  
Although it has been argued that there are no universally accepted international law principles regulating the position of employees of foreign States , relevant case law has often considered a contract of employment as merely a special type of commercial / private law contract .

The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
The Council reiterates the importance of a stable and predictable political and economic environment for local and foreign investment and other international financial flows , which remain essential for Africa 's economic and social development .  
The European Union commends the efforts of OAU and all those who have supported it in its search for a peaceful solution to the conflict , which has caused enormous human and physical losses in Ethiopia and Eritrea , jeopardizes political and economic stability in the two countries and in the region , and undermines their capacity to attract foreign support needed for their development .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Complementary policies are needed in a number of areas , for example in respect of supporting proper access to investment financing and venture capital ; facilitating access to new technologies and to match-making with foreign partners ; active labour market policies , including retraining for new technologies and activities ; unemployment insurance ; and the provision of basic infrastructure , industrial utilities and complementary services .  
UNCTAD 's future work should aim at improving developing countries understanding of the impact of foreign direct investment , through transnational corporations , on international trade , technology flows , enterprise development and their development prospects generally .  
Special attention needs to be given to improving the understanding of the interdependence of foreign direct investment , domestic investment , technological change and technology flows , the policies and practices of multinational firms and the evolution of corporate governance .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
A large number of non-governmental organizations - international , foreign and domestic - work in Uganda in areas related to the right to education ( such as social development , literacy , special education , gender , human rights ) but few explicitly address that right , thus exacerbating the paucity of conceptual and analytical work necessary for its promotion and protection .  
The first session , devoted to globalization competition and development , reviewed three issues of major importance for developing countries and economies in transition , namely : ( i ) foreign direct ( FDI ) , mergers and alliances ; ( ii ) deregulation , demonopolization and privatization ; and ( iii ) intellectual property rights , competition and transfer of technology .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .

The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
Full realization of the rights of all peoples , including those living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , to self-determination enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the international covenants on human rights , as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) of 14 December 1960 ;  
Costa Rica , Croatia , Singapore and Togo noted that the same standard with regard to remuneration , conditions of work and terms of employment applied to foreign and national workers , with women migrant workers having the same rights with regard to job security , extended vacation , night and overtime work as national women workers . 15 Costa Rica provided comprehensive information regarding migration into its territory , including penalties for illegal migration . 
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Singapore reported on educational materials which informed foreign workers that they were protected under national laws to the same extent as local workers , where they could seek assistance , and that abusive employers would be punished and barred from employing foreign workers in the future . 
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Our country is pursuing in practice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view to establishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral relations with all the countries of the world and to strengthening international security and stability .

A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
Emphasis must be placed on the Organizations crucial role in addressing the underlying causes of international political crises , including the right to self-determination for peoples under foreign occupation and alien domination , and in the economic and social fields .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
The risks involved for lenders included ( a ) the difficulty in forecasting traffic and determining what amount of tolls users would be prepared to pay ; ( b ) the fact that users usually paid in domestic currency , so that foreign investors faced a currency mismatch between their investment and their cash-flow return ; and ( c ) the risk that municipalities would change the tolls to please their constituency , in particular before elections .  
However , key parts of the deterioration ( such as the accumulation in the spring of 1997 by the central bank of Thailand of a large part of the forward exchange liabilities that depleted its net foreign exchange reserves ) may take place during short periods , so that improved disclosure would not necessarily protect the debtor from sudden reactions by creditors and investors which are highly concentrated in time .  
In that regard , foreign direct investment , technical assistance for national capacity-building and export outlets were but a few of the indispensable conditions for the participation of the South in world trade .  Vigorous and sustainable economic growth , which could greatly foster employment and poverty eradication efforts , was vital .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
General Assembly resolution 53 / 175 stressed the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment ( preambular para . 12 ) and the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth ( para .  9 ) .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
This fellowship programme aims to give participants , in particular mid-level diplomats and national civil servants dealing with international issues , access to comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills , and possibly other related subjects .  
While considerable progress had been made towards the development of an open , non-discriminatory , secure , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system , much remained to be done ; his country , which was heavily dependent on foreign trade , had suffered greatly from the remaining inequities in the current system .  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the policies of reform being implemented by African countries , their economic situation remains critical and African recovery and development continue to be severely hindered by , inter alia , the persistence of lower commodity prices and the heavy debt burden and are also substantially affected by the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment , as well as the ongoing conflicts in some regions of the continent ,  
Their activities were legitimate , competitive and regulated ; they were not dissimilar from those of developed countries that encouraged foreign direct investment .

Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .  
Given those circumstances , the ministers for foreign affairs of the Group of 77 had emphasized at the meeting held in New York on 24 September 1999 that , while globalization was often unpredictable and uneven , it could , if properly managed and based on strengthened cooperation , open the way for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels . 
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;

The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
The Government of our Republic has consistently maintained a policy of providing jobs , free medical treatment and free education to all people , even amid serious temporary economic difficulties created by economic blockades of foreign forces and natural disasters which have recurred over a number of consecutive years .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
Reflecting the fundamental new direction that international relations have recently taken , the Courts subject matter has also dramatically expanded to include a wide variety of issues : maritime boundaries , territorial sovereignty , the use of force , non-interference in the internal affairs of States , diplomatic relations , hostage-taking , the right to asylum , nationality , expropriation of foreign property and rights of passage .  
They include numerous illegal measures that interfere with the legitimate economic and commercial activities of foreign companies based outside United States jurisdiction , as well as complete prohibitions not only against the Republic of Cuba , but against all Cuban nationals , without exception , residing in Cuban territory , who are prevented from engaging in any transactions , while all of their property , deposits , savings , inheritances and pensions in the United States have been confiscated . 
The blockade has created countless obstacles to Cubas economic development ; it has made it impossible for Cuba to acquire products , equipment , goods , services and technology ; it has deprived it of funding and credits ; it has inflicted severe damage on its foreign trade by depressing the prices of what we sell and raising the costs of imports and transportation ; it has affected every sector of the national economy , with severe consequences for the living conditions of our people .  
The Argentine Republic has promulgated an act establishing that foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impending the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within Argentine territory .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
Because of the continued organized plunder of Iraqs archaeological artifacts , foreign museums and galleries are packed with these antiques , as are the special collections retained by art traffickers and professional collectors .  
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
The Working Group noted with concern violations of the civil and economic rights of migrant women workers , including foreign contract workers , who were subjected to ill-treatment , limited personal freedom and inadequate or no payment for their work , without the possibility of recourse to the legal system of the receiving country for justice .

In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
We have established diplomatic relations and are developing beneficial cooperation with all of them , in accordance with the provisions of resolution 50-80 B . In accordance with our foreign policy of open borders and equality and taking advantage of our geostrategic position as a central State in the Balkans we are becoming an important place for the development of international cooperation in all of south-eastern Europe . 
Moreover , in the case of securitization of mortgage loans , an assignment against the consumer-debtor may materially increase the burden of risk imposed on the consumer-debtor ( if , e.g . , the mortgage loan is assigned by the friendly local savings and loans bank to a foreign lender , who may be more aggressive in the collection of the outstanding amounts of the loan or in handling any variable interest rate ) .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
In its resolution 1998-24 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint for a three-year period a special rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to the Commission on an annual basis , beginning at its fifty-fifth session , an analytical report on the implementation of the resolution .  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
Along this line of thinking , the Minister of Social Security , in a very fruitful and frank exchange of views with the Representative , spoke of the high intellectual potential of the displaced and the considerable amount of current foreign investment in the country , suggesting that these two elements combined could be capitalized upon through skills-training and job creation in the field of the latest technology .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
Besides being sometimes needed to satisfy national constitutional and other requirements , the enactment of express legislative authorization may be an important measure to foster the confidence of potential investors , national or foreign , in a national policy to promote private sector investment in infrastructure .  
Although it seems obvious , we must remember that this draft resolution calls for negotiating the complete , comprehensive prohibition of anti-personnel landmines , and that independent of the irresponsible or indiscriminate use of landmines on many occasions , it is no secret to anyone that even now , many countries use landmines to defend themselves against foreign aggression .  
This can be achieved through direct government policies , joint ventures with local private initiatives , and foreign investment from regional and international public and private banks .  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
And for an archipelagic State like Seychelles , the aerial surveillance of its huge exclusive economic zone against foreign illegal fishing is much enhanced by good intra-island telecommunication services .  
China Road and Bridge stated that under the relevant laws of China , a Chinese national is not entitled to work abroad unless it is with a company or an organization authorized by the Chinese Government to engage in a foreign economic cooperation business .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
In order to do so , airlines have to be attractive enough to be accepted as members of alliances , as partners in code-sharing and other cooperative arrangements , as enterprises that may be successfully privatized through national or foreign capital , or as companies capable of absorbing market solutions such as franchising or other arrangements with world-class airlines .  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
In addition to lacking sufficient local market knowledge , foreign firms may also be liable in their own country if they are prohibited from offering bribes by their national foreign bribery legislation or if their Governments have ratified international agreements such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions .  
The types of acts publishable under the Convention will include corrupt activities involving an international civil servant , a foreign public official , a judge or other official of an international court . 23 The importance of addressing organized crimes perpetration of and involvement in corruption is undisputed . 
The Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable by effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable with those applicable to bribery of domestic officials .  
It must not be forgotten that the European Union already has a single currency , is developing common foreign and defence policies , and even recently appointed a high official to coordinate that undertaking .  
To make matters worse , they find it difficult without the requisite technology and human resource base to attract foreign direct investment , which is increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging economies .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
We consider it of prime importance that the renewed Council be a representative and balanced organ through the inclusion of new members , from industrially developed countries and influential developing States alike , pursuing independent foreign policies .  
This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development , and it recognizes the importance of private capital , particularly foreign direct investment , in development financing .  
In the context of judicial cooperation , they covered issues such as controlled delivery , undercover operations , maritime cooperation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , use of foreign evidence , asset forfeiture and witness protection .  
The recent slowdown in economic activity , the sharp worsening of foreign reserves and severe contraction of public expenditure on basic services , are inflicting further hardship on the poor .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
Undertaking studies on the level of national savings , the development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
In the context of judicial cooperation , they covered issues such as controlled delivery , undercover operations , maritime cooperation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , use of foreign evidence , asset forfeiture and witness protection .  
The ongoing war has contributed to continuing human rights violations , sustained interference by foreign Powers and farreaching environmental damage , not to mention the staggering social cost of the long civil war .  
Decides to appoint an independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , for a period of three years ;

Decides to appoint an independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , for a period of three years ;  
Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
Furthermore , the threat may not be determined on the basis of ulterior political motives there must be genuine international concern behind the sanctions , not the foreign or domestic policy considerations of a single State or group of States .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Polands solid growth , macroeconomic stability , sound monetary policy , established banking system , modernized industry and reformed pension system had attracted foreign investors and helped it to withstand the global economic turbulence of recent years . 
In the light of the intensifying fighting and the worsening humanitarian situation , I decided to convene a meeting of the six plus two group on 15 September at the level of foreign ministers .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
The Malaysian Government , the private sector and academia had joined hands to respond to the increasing shortage of skilled human resources in Penang relative to the inflows of foreign and local investment in the late 1980s .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
For countries mainly indebted to private foreign creditors , a primary goal of solutions to debt-servicing crises is sustainable borrowing from international financial markets under normal terms of access .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right .  
After the disengagement phase has been successfully completed , there will be numerous complex tasks ahead in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in terms of moving forward the disarmament and demobilization of the armed groups and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The Commission appointed Mr . Fantu Cheru as independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .  
In its economic policy , neutral Turkmenistan has proclaimed and is consistently putting into practice the open doors principle , aimed at mutually advantageous cooperation with all States , and is establishing equal conditions for the effective functioning of foreign companies in its territory , irrespective of their national origin and form of ownership .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
UNIDO also had a local role to play in helping to establish a reliable and transparent legal and economic environment conducive to direct foreign investment .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right ,  
In 1975 , after enduring periods of foreign domination , colonization and neo-colonialism , his countrys multi-ethnic people had chosen a political system suited to their historical , economic , social and cultural particularities .  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
Representatives of national space agencies , foreign and defence ministries , academies of science , leading outer-space-related scientific and research centres , commercial and industrial companies , international and non-governmental outer space organizations , universities , scientific and education centres , insurance companies and banks engaged in outer-space-related activities , and also cosmonauts and astronauts have been invited to attend the forum .  
Both the new State and entity Governments have ambitious plans to further the reforms cutting tax rates and widening the tax base , improving collection of customs and excise payments and pushing forward with privatization to attract both domestic and foreign investors and to balance official budgets .  
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Stress the negative economic consequences of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , conscious that the economic difficulties of Africa can not be explained exclusively by foreign factors and historical events and aware that it is nevertheless a reality that those factors and events have had profound crippling effects on the economic development of Africa and that justice now requires that substantial national and international efforts be made to repair the damage ;  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,

Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .

There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .

Anti-trust-law which was aimed at preserving workable markets ( i.e . markets that were subject to workable competition obliging enterprises to meet the prices of rivals ) could aid in this process through the creation of the right conditions for the transferor and the recipient that established a balance between the interests of all parties ( in subcontracting , foreign direct investment , research and development cooperation and licensing ) , although this balance must be adjusted to the specific circumstances prevailing in individual cases .

The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .

In its foreign policy , the Democratic Republic of the Congo understands that the use of force can not settle the problems confronting the world today and that in the struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a universal conscience and a universal union that can eliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very survival of the human race .  It is for this reason that my country has signed and ratified several global conventions dealing with the question of international terrorism .  
For the global fight against poverty to be sustained following those attacks , it was crucial to : boost and better target foreign aid ; complement strong reform efforts ; reduce trade barriers ; ensure that the WTO Ministerial Conference was motivated by the desire to use trade as a tool for poverty reduction and development ; and build social consensus for ongoing reforms . 
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
To that end , he advocated examination of the root causes , as well as the symptoms , of the planets economic and social ills , which included under-development , poverty , illiteracy , unemployment , prolonged foreign occupations , debilitating conditionalities and inequitable trading patterns , all of which called for resolute national and international actions .  
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .

In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .

For that purpose , alliances have to be promoted between domestic and foreign enterprises of all sizes for the supply of services nationally and internationally ; a network of national and international companies supplying core and related energy services should be established ; and the energy strategy must be supported by Venezuelas active participation in the multilateral trade negotiation forums .

Those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition .  This has raised Shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high-tech industries .

In the view of a foreign trade expert , Cheng Shichang , Zhejiang 's economic structure and export pattern are quite representative in eastern China . Following China 's accession to the WTO and the gradual abolition of passive quotas , its advantages will surely be further demonstrated .  
The accession to the WTO means that China 's enterprises will be engaged in equal competition with foreign enterprises from the same starting line in the world economic arena .  Whether or not the enterprises can attain even greater development in the huge economic arena in the world and be in an invincible position in the bitter international competition essentially hinges upon their comprehensive quality and competitive power .  
To enterprises , it is far from enough if they merely have the general knowledge of the WTO 's basic rules .  Hence , it is necessary to adopt multiple forms to train , as quickly as possible , a large number of special personnel who are familiar with the WTO rules , proficient in foreign languages , and capable of participating in the settlement of trade disputes .

[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .

It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
The strategic adjustment of the economic structure will give rise to huge investment and consumption demand .

Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Recently , the state has promulgated the " Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Granting Preferential Treatment to Foreign-Invested Enterprises Set Up in the Central and Western Regions by Reducing Enterprise Income Tax Rate to 15 Percent in Three Years , " by which the foreign-invested enterprises encouraged by the state to set up in the central and western regions may reduce their enterprise income tax to 15 percent within three years after the current term of the tax preferential policy expires .  This will energetically boost foreign investment in the central and western regions .

Perhaps , Li Hongzhi and his people think that inciting some addicts into causing troubles can win merits from the foreign boss and allow " Falungong " to linger out a feeble existence .  However , the self-immolation incident at Tiananmen Square exactly further exposed Li Hongzhi 's scheme .  The horrifying looking burnt addicts , as images of teachers by negative example , tell people that " Falungong " is a cult and tolerance toward the cult means cruelty to the innocent lives .  
Asahara styled himself " emperor of the holy law , " and under him were 21 " departments " such as the east and west disciples department , espionage department , defense department , and foreign affairs department .  He also starting drafting a so-called " first draft of the basic law for the land of truth , " and set himself up as the supreme ruler of the " land of truth . "  
They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .  
These provisions on the basis of reviewing our militarys experiences in information security and confidentiality in the new situation and learning positive practices from foreign countries and foreign military forces not only provide explicit requirements on some crucial issues , but also systematically specify the basic principle , duty and authorization , preventative measures and administrative procedures regarding information security and confidentiality .

In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
Since Iraq recovered its domestic and some of its international air routes , more than 40 foreign planes have flown to Baghdad carrying ranking government officials and humanitarian materials , including even some US political figures , and the " no-fly zone " set up by the United States and Britain in fact exists only in name ; the United States has felt all the more that it " has no face at all " and seeks to demonstrate its powerful military strength and Gulf presence by bombing Iraq .  
It has thoroughly given up the practice of either leaning toward the West or confronting the West , but has adopted an omnidirectional foreign strategy of conducting dialogue , laying equal stress on relations with the East and the West , developing relations with big powers , and strengthening bilateral or multilateral relations with other countries , aimed at protecting its national interests , particularly economic interests .

The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
The draft outline of the 10th Five-year Plan now being examined and discussed by the " two sessions " mentions : China will gradually implement national treatment for foreign investment enterprises , and draw up a unified , standard , and transparent policy on permitting market entry ; and restrictions on the equity ratio in enterprises will be removed , except for important sectors and enterprises related to national security and national economic lifelines , in which the state must hold the controlling equity .  
In connection with Powell 's recent stream of indiscretions on various sensitive policies , which have even sparked off some diplomatic disputes , some media have pointed out that Powell 's frequent " indiscretions " on certain key issues , as the man in charge of foreign policy in the world 's sole " superpower , " may be deliberate , and that his aim in using " indiscretions " to explore reactions from various sides is very evident .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
The latest statistics show that China continues to be in front rank of the world in the amount of foreign capital used but , in light of the national condition that we have a vast territory but a dense population and there is a wide economic gap between regions , the use of foreign capital still needs to be expanded and its quality improved .  
The majority of military scientific research workers should adapt themselves to the general development trend of the global military revolution , consistently carry forward our military 's excellent valuable resources , enthusiastically learn advanced experiences from foreign military forces and make greater contributions to bringing further prosperity and development to our military science and to boosting national defense and military modernization construction .

Our nation has established agricultural technology exchanges and economic cooperative relations with over 140 countries .  At the end of 1997 , a total of 7,300 agricultural items had included foreign investment with agreed upon amounts reaching about $ 14-billion .  This allowed us to introduce a considerable amount of advanced scientific and technological results and over 100,000 varieties of resources .  
After liberalized reforms , the systemic reform of the rural economy was a step ahead of that for city economies , but , due to a lack of changes in the agricultural management system by the government , the agricultural product markets and the agricultural key element markets have been split up among various departments such as farming , forestry , economic trade , foreign trade and labor .  In some areas , such administrative departments as animal husbandry , fisheries , and water resources also participate in the market divisions .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
Since Bush assumed office , it seems that the hardliners have gotten the upper hand as far as foreign policy is concerned .  They appear to be more and more presumptuous , not only to China , but other countries have also taken note of it .  Even European countries with friendly ties with the US are very displeased with the US for " repudiating " what many countries had agreed upon , and refusing to sign the Kyoto Accord which sets a limit to the emission of substances that are harmful to the ozone layer .

Although the two speeches made by President Bush were rather rude andperemptory , comments from foreign mass media also noticed that US Secretary ofDefense Rumsfeld , a " hawkish figure , " did not make any open speech on the eventand was criticized by other hawkish figures in the United States . This mayindicate a possibility that after the occurrence of the incident , the hawkishdecision-makers in the United States were not appointed to play a major role inthe handling of the crisis .  
Through agreat historical change , China thoroughly terminated its miserable history ofbeing victimized by foreign aggression and becoming weak and poor , and beganthe new process of making the people rich and making the nation strong .

They have resolutely urged the US Government toapologize to the Chinese people and to fully shoulder the responsibility .  
From his election campaign , Bush was bent on pursuing a foreign policy different from that of the Clinton administration , and behaved in a hawkish style on many events to win support from the American public .  This time , shortly after the occurrence of the plane collision incident , he immediately selected the option of making a tough-worded statement on an open occasion , rather than dialing a phone call to Beijing .  
As for the process of handling the incident , Jin Chanrong said , there existed some problems in the foreign policy-making body of the Bush administration .  Although there are some veteran officials with rich experience inside the government , it was hard to find someone who may have a final say and can convince others , or it is possible that the veterans with experience may be short of the ability to handle new problems .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
The Pentagon is still sticking to its hardline stance , and has even again sent reconnaisance planes to carry out provocative activities ; apart from showing that the United States is unable to advance any further arguments to justify itself , it shows all the more the current US administration 's blind spots and total ignorance in foreign policy - - at least we have already seen that the diplomats involved in this affair are all military men who lack normal knowledge of foreign affairs , and even lack essential knowledge of Chinese humanity and history .  
Numerous facts have proven that US economic development is increasingly dependent on foreign countries and that the more peaceful and prosperous the world is and the more opened and developed the world is , the more it is beneficial to the United States .

On the basis of such an agreement , the accepting state and the foreign country must also reach a special agreement on relevant community before the foreign military forces are eligible for sovereign immunity in the accepting state .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .

Speaking of China 's foreign policies , President Jiang stressed : Maintaining independence and keeping the initiative are the most salient characteristics of China 's diplomacy .

Having studied some burning issues in the current international and regional situation , the foreign ministers confirm in the joint communiqu ? that they have the same position and pledge to jointly commit to the further reinforcement and continuous improvement of the cooperation among the " Shanghai Five " in international affairs .

In recent years , the nation has launched ad hoc campaigns to crack down on smuggling , tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , production and sale of counterfeit and shoddy goods , and other illegal criminal activities .

tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .

For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .

"  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .

In the wake of the gradual deepening of China 's market-oriented reform of the foreign currency interest rates , its foreign currency interest rates are no longer shut in their own closed environment and are instead linking tracks with the international financial community ; they are following international practices and rules and regulations to increasingly move up and down in sync with the international interest rates .  The characteristics of internationalization and conformity are becoming more clear with each passing day .  
China and APEC members have maintained very close economic and trade relations for a long time , with the absolute value of trade growing year after year .

The Communist Party of India bluntly denounced the current government as a " proxy " of the United States in India , as it violated India 's " consistent foreign policy " .  The National Congress Party also said that the government 's reaction was " reckless " and " immature " .

On the basis that liberated areas had already developed foreign trade , a series of major measures were taken to comprehensively set up a socialist system governing foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .  As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .

Under the guidance of these scientific theories and under the correct leadership of the three generations of leadership groups respectively with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin as the core , our Party has put an end to times when our country was as loose and split as a plate of sand , poor , weak and carved up at the whim of foreign countries .

We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .

We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
We adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace .  We have carried out friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries and treated one another as equals on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in a ceaseless effort to advance the cause of human progress .

The cumulative total of actual utilization of direct investment by foreign companies now exceeds $ 360-billion , and China has ranked first in the world in bringing in foreign investment for eight successive years .

Zhang Qiyue said , as everyone knows , China practices a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , and its military expenditure has always been at a low level among major world powers .

Since , however , Britain has consistently been a loyal follower of US foreign policy , and has consistently acted as an irreplaceable bridge between the United States and Europe , given the marked decline in its national strength , if Britain wants to maintain its great power status and continue to have major influence in the international arena , it will do everything possible to avoid damaging its traditional special relationship with the United States on account of the differences between them .

Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .

Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
It goes without saying that our foreign policy should be a steady one , and we should conceal our true features and gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck .  However , Japanese authorities have behaved with unbearable insolence for a long time ; their unfriendly attitude towards China has been clearly showed by a series of incidents , such as the Diaoyutai incident , the incident of altering textbooks , the incident of paying homage to Yasukuni Shrine , and the incident of imposing punitive tariffs on imported Chinese farm products .

As China has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of Renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .

After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform .

Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
China 's positive use of foreign capital has played an enormous role in promoting the national economic growth , precipitating the development of import and export trade , and increasing the number of people having found jobs .

However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
Under the pretext of the so-called " China threat theory , " some foreign forces have also seized opportunities to intervene in the Taiwan question , an act of interference in China 's internal affairs , through diverse means such as , in the military sphere , continuing arms sales to Taiwan and building " theater missile defense , " in an attempt to secure their strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region through the continued playing of the " Taiwan card , " thereby presenting a threat to our national security .

The third prerequisite - - " if Taiwan refuses , indefinitely , the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiations " - - is added to the current white paper .  In view of the changing situation , the first two prerequisites in the current white paper become more accurate by changing " if Taiwan declares independence " into " if any major incident of separating Taiwan from China takes place " and changing " if there is any interference from outside forces " into " if Taiwan is occupied by foreign forces . "  
In front of the Zhongxing Communications stall , the general secretary had his attention attracted by a conference television system developed and produced by the company .

Thanks to the originally sound economic foundation , better transport facilities , and more qualified personnel , it was more convenient for the eastern region to attract foreign capital and increase economic contacts with the countries and regions outside the country .  Obviously , focusing the development on the eastern region could reap greater and faster economic results , which was already proved by facts , as tremendous achievements in the economic development had been attained in the eastern region .  
Fourth , after years of development , the western region has initially possessed the soft environment for attracting foreign investment , and more and more overseas enterprises , having realized the enormous potential for the western development , have come one after another to make investment in the western region .  
Now , it is basically provided with the capacities of conducting sea-air maneuver and conducting operations in coordination with all other armed forces .  It has played a positive role in resisting the invasion of foreign enemies , defending the security of the sea and the air , safeguarding China 's marine rights and interests , and supporting the economic construction of the state .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
The foreign environmental protection enterprises ' natural link with the market economy enables them to gain advanced experiences in operational mechanism , market concepts , innovation awareness , personnel and distribution system , and others which are suited to the market economy .  These are useful experiences that the domestic environmental protection enterprises can use for reference in their development , reform , and transformation of operational mechanism at a faster pace so as to suit the major development trend of the environmental protection markets all over the world .  
Lai Qinwei , director of the Hainan Provincial Foreign Economic and Trade Department , said : Hainan will have a brilliant future in its foreign economic and trade work as long as it follows the road chartered by General Secretary Jiang Zemin . Hainan should base itself on the advantages of local resources and geographical position .  
We are making further efforts to strengthen foreign trade , taking even more flexible measures by reference to preferential policies in free trade zones , and lifting the control over and invigorating in an organized manner the markets of traditional trade with adjacent countries to intensify efforts in opening along the border .  
Meanwhile , China has increased its foreign exchange reserves , successfully maintained the value of the Renminbi , and tightened its control over the capital market and the foreign exchange market .  As a result , China has attained desired results in resisting the adverse impacts of the Asian financial turmoil , and also in its bid to join the WTO this year .  
In fact , it has become a common practice that domestic websites are listed abroad , and once their listing is proven successful , the percentage of their shares held by foreign businesses will be readjusted further .  
However , the absolute quantity of civilian products produced by armament industry enterprises declined rapidly , mainly because of insufficient investment , debt payment failures , competition of foreign goods , unsuccessful privatization , and technological and operational difficulties in changing products .  
Since his assuming the post of the chairman of the government in September last year and becoming the acting president at the end of December , Putin has repeatedly expressed that he will persist in developing and deepening the Sino-Russia strategic partnership of cooperation [ zhong e zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi 0022 0192 2096 3970 0588 0155 0129 0133 7070 0190 ] and will consider Sino-Russian relations as the cornerstone of Russian foreign affairs .  
With the pace of opening to the outside world further accelerated , China 's economy will merge into the world economy in a still positive attitude , and the domestic market will be integrated with the international market with each passing day , which will contribute to better utilizing the domestic and foreign resources and provide economic growth with even greater room for maneuver .  
Some relevant experts believe that after these mineral-exploration rights newly drafted by the Chinese Government are expanded and opened up , a large amount of foreign capital , technologies , and talented people will be attracted to take part in the risk exploration and development of mineral resources in Central and West China , which will play an active propelling role to the further exploration of the rich mineral resources in the whole country .  
Experts say that faced with a new development trend in the world auto industry marked by concentration , development of high and technologies , globalization of management , and by sophisticated production methods , China 's auto industry must develop a modern enterprise system that is adapted to that of foreign developed countries .  Reform , restructuring , and technological innovation are the fundamental way out to raise enterprises ' competitiveness .  
Shi Guangsheng , Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , stressed on the same occasion that an unconditional PNTR status with no strings attached [ gan jing li luo de 0051 0403 0448 5507 4104 ] is the prerequisite and foundation for the implementation of the Sino-US WTO bilateral agreement ; the Chinese side appreciated the commitment and efforts made by the US Government .  
The source said that Liu Zhibing is now suspected of grafting public funds and accepting bribes totaling more than 1 million yuan .  From the period when he was known as " Liuzhou tyrant " to the period when he served as a leader of the regional party committee and government , Liu sought illegal interests and made things convenient for his wife and children by abusing power .  He also received a large amount of bribes in cash and goods from the businessmen ( including foreign businessmen ) involved in several major projects under his control .  
According to their analysis , experts maintained : Factors , such as the accelerated economic recovery in the Asian region , steady domestic economic growth , and the acceleration of China 's entry into the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] have played an important role in the recovery of foreign capital utilization .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
As China has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of Renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .  
China 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that China is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
Therefore , China 's relevant departments have stipulated that in order to protect national interest and economic security , China 's companies are forbidden to buy products with encryption software designed by foreign countries and no domestic organization or individual shall sell foreign commercial encryption products .  
China 's entry into WTO will certainly promote China 's link with the world economy and strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in making investment in China . It will create a more stable outside environment for China 's economic development and help China realize the strategic goal of a sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
With regard to Taiwan 's form of government , the Taiwan authorities are seeking to transform Taiwan into an " independent political entity " through a " constitutional reform . "  In foreign relations , the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to carry out the activities of creating " two Chinas . " In military affairs , the Taiwan authorities have bought large quantities of advanced weapons from foreign countries and attempted to establish a military alliance of a disguised form with the United States and Japan .  
Although the introduction of foreign capital to expedite the SOE structural reform through merger and acquisition is feasible , yet the authoritative personage thinks that the central government may not necessarily adopt this method but will be inclined to choose other progressive reform plans for fear that it may cause more SOE workers to lose their jobs and thus affect social stability .  
China 's positive use of foreign capital has played an enormous role in promoting the national economic growth , precipitating the development of import and export trade , and increasing the number of people having found jobs .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
However , if there is any major incident of making Taiwan break away from China in any name , if there occurs foreign occupation of Taiwan , or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of unification of the two sides of the strait through negotiation , the Chinese government will be forced to take all possible decisive measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to complete the great cause of unification of China .  
Under the pretext of the so-called " China threat theory , " some foreign forces have also seized opportunities to intervene in the Taiwan question , an act of interference in China 's internal affairs , through diverse means such as , in the military sphere , continuing arms sales to Taiwan and building " theater missile defense , " in an attempt to secure their strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region through the continued playing of the " Taiwan card , " thereby presenting a threat to our national security .

With the " backing " of the huge defense budget , the extremely expansive and aggressive US military and foreign policy has worsened the international atmosphere and disrupted international order , and goes against the tide of the times of world peace and development ; it is " bad tidings " as mankind enters the new century .  
In terms of technological structure , the low technological level is a grave defect of the non-public economy .  In the sections where the technological level plays a decisive role , such as the manufacturing section and the new economic section , the non-public enterprises are usually at an unfavorable position while competing with foreign enterprises .  
Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
It is necessary to take advantage of the opportune moment of the WTO entry to leave no stone unturned to expand exports and heighten the level of using foreign capital , maintain the current momentum of growth in foreign trade , and exercise the role of export demand in promoting economic growth .  
In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
Personalities in foreign countries universally think that the Chinese policy to refrain from Renminbi 's devaluation in recent years has played a positive role in stabilizing the financial markets in Asia . As the principal decisionmaking department responsible for the exchange rate policies , the SAFE had a very good grasp of the policies , and its role is elevated accordingly .  
Xu Fangming listed the following facts to prove that China has no problem in repaying her sovereign foreign debts : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , China 's economy has developed by leaps and bounds , which has resulted in sustained , healthy , and stable national economic growth .  
Without PNTR , China eventually will still join the WTO , but if following China 's WTO entry , such factors of disharmony still exist in Sino-US relations , China 's development after WTO entry will be subject to the negative impact of conservative forces coming from within the United States and from Congress , which is unfavorable to China in its bid to make better use of the opportunity of WTO entry to do such things as investing , developing foreign economic and trade connections , and system reform .  
If the leader of the Taiwan authorities engages in wishful thinking that he can use a vague , dilatory , and evasive style to relegate the problem to the future , and throw the problem to foreign powers and the international community , the result will be something that he can not bear to imagine .  
The developed coastal areas and suburban districts of large and medium cities should proceed from their local superiority and give priority to the development of agriculture with fine quality and high efficiency as well as agriculture that earns foreign exchange .  
To sum up , we may see that only the saving of military and diplomatic expenses and the lowering of the costs by the " three direct links " will bring huge benefits ; as for the tapping of potential from cross-strait cooperation , the invisible assets in the political , foreign relations , cultural , and educational fields will be immeasurable .  
Meanwhile , the CSHRS must continue to take an active part in international human rights activities ; conduct more dialogues , exchanges , and cooperation with foreign organizations and personages ; and make unremitting efforts to enhance understanding and cooperation between the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world in upholding human rights , expand consensus unceasingly , and jointly promote the international community 's universal respect of human rights and basic freedom .  
The separatist forces have disregarded the historical trend of China 's reunification , and pleaded with foreign forces in a vain attempt to bring about " Taiwan independence . "  This is completely a futile effort out of their wishful thinking .  
However , cross-strait reunification has been delayed for a long time and we still have failed to conclude the 50-year-old state of hostility .  But Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] , who has been discarded by all the Chinese people , interrupted and hampered cross-strait exchanges and consultations whenever he could , created new troubles by proposing the " two-state theory " to split China 's national sovereignty and territory , and futilely attempted to materialize foreign powers ' dreams of splitting China 's national sovereignty and territory with his " two-state theory . "  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
The first is to suddenly employ large-scale military operations , using the effectiveness of a wave [ attack ] to make their military operations , transportation , communications , electric power , mass media , and other crucial facilities lose their function and utility , causing Taiwan to be paralyzed .  Only by having the first wave reach this kind of level can the foreign anti-Chinese forces be made to give up their plan of interfering .

It is in the course of developing normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries and in its struggle aimed at safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that the Chinese Government has adhered to the One China principle and has won both understanding and support from a growing number of countries and international organizations .  
In addition , regarding the 85 duty paragraphs of agricultural products which the US side is concerned about , the two sides agreed that the actual customs tariff of 30.8 percent at the signing of the agreement will be reduced to 14.5 percent in five years , the total amount of import quotas for wheat , rice , and corn set at 13 million tonnes in 2000 will be raised to 23 million tonnes in 2004 , and the business volume of non-state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be increased too .  
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to establish friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world , including Yugoslavia , on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and to make joint efforts for the establishment of a new , peaceful , stable , just , and rational political order so that mankind will have a better tomorrow .

Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .

Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .

This research fellow of the State Council 's Development Studies Center said that the main obstacle to foreign enterprises operating in China arises from problems in the domestic setup ; in 1997 the Chinese Government set " building a state with legal system " as the basic goal in the reform of China 's political setup , and we should now make practical efforts to achieve this .  
At this summit , both Kim Chong-il and Kim Yong Nam have emphatically stressed the importance of " independence and reunification " ; and have pointed out that since " foreign countries are not happy to see a united Korean Peninsula to become a strong country " and will surely place various kinds of obstacles to hinder reunification , the Korean nation must rely on its own strength , independently resolve the nation 's internal contradictions , and bring true the country 's grand cause of reunification .

adhere to the principles of " making the past serve the present , " " making foreign things serve China , " and " weeding through the old to bring forth the new , " actively inherit and carry forward outstanding traditional cultures , study hard , absorb , and use as reference outstanding foreign cultures while resisting all corrupt and decadent ideas and cultures of the exploiting class and opposing the " Westernization " and " division " schemes of hostile forces at home and abroad .  
The increase in domestic and foreign demand stimulated comprehensive improvement in the production sector and enabled China 's entire economy to develop toward a good orientation .  The quality of economic performance improved steadily .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She pointed out that while opening up wider to the outside world , the western region should pay attention to opening up to other parts of the country , establishing various kinds and forms of economic cooperation with the developed areas in the interior , supplementing each other 's advantages , making great efforts to develop high-tech enterprises , and jointly developing domestic and foreign markets to attain common development .  
They show in the face of the intricate international situation , Chinese leaders still hold fast to their judgment that peace and development remain the theme of the present-day world .  They uphold an independent foreign policy of peace while firmly adhering to the central task of economic development , which has enabled China to make new achievements of world interest on the diplomatic front and has steadily raised its international status .  
The foreign ministers of the five countries express their deep worry over the increasingly rampant activities of the forces of national separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism .

"  
Wang Qishan said that : For a year and a half now , the courts and the GITICS Clearing Team have been acting in line with the law , regulations , and international practice , adhering to and reflecting the principles of openness , fairness , and impartiality in each step and every link , which has increased transparency and raised the public trust .  Both domestic and foreign debts have all been serviced equally , with the creditors being satisfied , and the social results also being good .  
Grounded in a conscientious summary of the experience of the previous stage , the Guangdong Party Committee and Government are acting as always , by giving all out support to the intensified pursuit and recovery of foreign debts by the courts and the clearance team .  We are converting bankrupt assets into cash and liquidating debts faster , in an effort to raise the debt service rate , for a satisfactory conclusion of the clearance and hearing of the GITICS bankruptcy case .  
In the long run , the RMB will move from a larger fluctuation range to floating freely , and will become freely convertible in the end ; and this can be said a gradual process of relaxing foreign exchange controls .

The Xinhua website is composed of websites sponsored by Xinhua News Agency , eight Chinese and foreign language websites under Xinhua , websites operated by 12 magazines affiliated to Xinhua , and 35 local Xinhua divisions and branches .

Moreover , the planes ' main components and parts , equipment , airborne weapons , and maintenance technology are highly dependent on foreign countries .  Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , supply for the planes will become difficult and the number of such planes owned by the Taiwan Air Force will decrease with each plane shut down .  
With regard to building a rapid reaction mechanism for the market , we should make efforts to counter speculation in the foreign exchange realm our starting point , because once we join the WTO , the foreign currency management departments will of course have to employ after-the-fact inspections to uncover illegal activity in the foreign exchange realm and crack down on it sharply , but the more important thing will be the direct and preemptive disruption of speculative offensive behavior targeting China 's financial markets .

Now we will strive to achieve this target ahead of schedule .  
In the first half of this year , China 's GDP grew at the rate of 8.2 percent , the financial sector operated steadily , and enterprises continued to increase their economic results , which have created favorable conditions for achieving the targets of the entire year 's national economic and foreign trade development .  
Wu Yi pointed out at the same time that confronted with the accelerated development of various countries in the world and the situation of increasingly keen competition , central and local departments at all levels in charge of foreign economic relations and trade must maintain a sober mind , follow the situation closely , analyze the difficulties and uncertain factors that they may encounter in work calmly and objectively , adopt effective measures in good time , and make great efforts to maintain the development momentum of various foreign trade business operations .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
It is learned that , since the name lists of our agents in the overseas and security personnel inside the country as well as the setup of the network are known to P'an Hsi-hsien like the back of his hand , the P'an case has created great tension for governments of those foreign countries which agreed to have our agents stationed there , because they fear their international relations and state security might be endangered should the relevant information fall into the hands of the Chicom [ Chinese communist ] authorities .  
After Putin was elected as Russia 's top leader , his administrative principles and foreign policy have become calmer and more pragmatic , and he has paid more attention to domestic affairs and become more familiar with the European security issue .  Some media maintained that Putin was focusing on the foreign affairs related to the United States and Europe .  
However , Putin 's China visit itself and his recent series of speeches on the policy toward China have clearly proven that the current Russian Government has not diminished its attention to Asia , and that it has fully affirmed and highly valued the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation , regarded China as Russia 's most important cooperative partner , and considered Sino-Russian relations the area Russia should develop on a priority basis in implementing its foreign policy .  
Governor of People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] Dan Xianglong today [ 19 July ] said at a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for Chinese and foreign reporters that , during the first half of this year , the PBOC further developed the role of monetary policy , strengthened financial support to economic growth , unveiled a number of management methods and policies , maintained a steady increase of money supply , and significantly promoted a recovery of the national economic growth .  
In fact , the amount of contractual foreign investments used by Guangdong has been on the increase in the first half of this year , the economy has been developing along a stable and improving trend , and the province 's economic vigor has increased quite remarkably .  
Moreover , we have also standardized or systematized the measures adopted by the supervision and management organs in the past in managing the financial companies and have laid down requirements for supervising or managing the financial companies in a unified way in their business relating to both domestic and foreign capital , both domestic and foreign currencies , as well as their business stated on or not on tables .

The number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises and the amounts of money involved in new agreements both increased by more than 20 percent , thus bringing about a gleam of hope to the people .  However , we can not be optimistic about the foreign capital inflow situation for this year because the actual input of foreign capital remains stagnant .  
The downward trend of foreign capital inflow was checked in the first half of this year thanks to the upward trend of the international economy and the economic recovery of Asia .  
We should also see that this upward trend was based on the continuous decrease in the number of newly approved foreign-funded enterprises in the past two years and the sharp decrease in the amount of money involved in the agreements signed last year .  So , we can not say with certainty that China will usher in another high tide of foreign capital inflow .  
China has ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of foreign capital inflow .  It is not realistic to expect China to witness a high , sustainable growth in foreign capital inflow as it did in the middle of the 1990 ' s .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .

As of the end of this year , China has successively approved the establishment of an accumulated total of more than 350,000 foreign-funded enterprises , with the relevant contracts involving foreign investment amounting to more than $ 630 billion ; and the foreign capital actually utilized over these years has exceeded $ 320 billion .  
In the face of such a new situation , ever since last year , the DPRK has been taking active steps to readjust its foreign policies .  It has engaged itself in multilateral diplomatic activities ; and has made positive headway in such aspects as improving the North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula , strengthening its relations with neighboring countries , and seeking to promote its ties with both western countries and countries in other parts of the world .  
The expanded domestic and foreign demand has brought an overall production improvement , with industrial operating quality markedly improved .  It is understood that over one-half of the losing large and medium state-owned enterprises [ SOE ] and state-owned stock-control or holding enterprises have now overcome their difficulties .  
In the white paper on " One-China Principle and Taiwan Issue , " the Chinese Government announced clearly that if a major change of events occurred where Taiwan is alienated from China in whatever name , if foreign forces invade and occupy Taiwan , and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuses to solve the cross-strait reunification issue peacefully through talks , the Chinese Government will be forced to adopt all possible drastic measures , including the use of force , to safeguard China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity so as to accomplish China 's great cause of reunification .  
They said their current first visit to China as " Troika " foreign ministers fully demonstrates the great importance the Rio Group attaches to developing its relations with China .

After taking office , Putin laid down a national development strategy designed to " make the country strong and people rich " and tentatively worked out an intermediate - and long-term economic development plan .  However , Russia 's heavy foreign debts , the difficulty in attracting investment , and the lack of money have become the main obstacle to Russia 's reform and economic revitalization .  
To cut off Chechnyan rebellious armed forces ' foreign aid and route of retreat and to create conditions for a comprehensive and complete settlement of the Chechen issue , Putin has been working actively to obtain the understanding and support of the international community .  
Putin 's diplomatic maneuvering of the last several months shows that in his foreign policy , he has a long-term strategic goal as well as strong consideration of the reality .  His overall foreign policy goal is defined as " ensuring national security " and " developing a good external environment for economic growth " to revitalize Russia .  
In the long-voyage practical training , the academy has set up a variety of tactical backgrounds and training items to fight strong enemies by exploiting the opportunity that foreign warships , aircraft , and submarines have frequently tailed and followed us to conduct reconnaissance .

The active use of foreign investments has promoted sustained , healthy , and rapid development in China 's economy , and particularly promoted China 's economic restructuring and industrial optimization .  It also has provided valuable business opportunities and vast markets to the large number of international investors ; intensified the integration of China 's economy with the world economy ;  
and added an enchanting brilliance to the prosperity and development of the global economy .  China 's stable political situation , social security , and an economy that has always maintained a relatively high speed of development , are key to China 's achievements in attracting foreign business investments .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .

Meanwhile , it should also support scientific research organizations , institutions of higher learning , and enterprises in restructuring their internal distribution systems in an effort to create favorable working and living conditions for the scientists , technicians , senior operators , and managers who have made outstanding contributions in the course of technological innovation and industrialization .  Consequently , they can attract more outstanding Chinese and foreign professionals with attractive environments , systems , and mechanisms .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .

It is necessary to step up efforts to make use of foreign capital and to actively introduce advanced technology , qualified personnel , and managerial expertise from abroad ; efforts should be made to accelerate the readjustment of the industrial structure , to upgrade the industry , to make technological innovations , to raise the quality and grade of products , and to make the products brand-name ones .  
In order to meet the requirements of China 's development of the western region , Wan Xueyuan , director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs , said here today that China 's hiring of foreign experts in the coming year will be focused on the development strategy of the western region .  We will draw the experience of foreign countries in regional development and implement the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , Wan Xueyuan said , we should enormously attract qualified personnel from the eastern region to participate in the economic construction and development of the western region , and also attract people from other countries , including Chinese students studying abroad and foreign experts .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , the Chinese Government will hire foreign experts focused on the pillar and special industries in the western region .  Both the central and local governments will offer support and preferences in the form of increased expenditure and subsidies .

If war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , and sea transport is blockaded , foreign trade as a support for economic development will suffer serious setbacks , many industrial production departments will halt production and close down , and the entire economy will be facing tremendous blows .  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
It is expected : During the " Ninth Five-Year Plan " period , China will in total have attracted $ 230 billion of foreign capital , nearly 100 percent more than in the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " period .  For seven consecutive years since 1993 , China has been the champion among developing countries for attracting foreign capital .  
It was precisely at this extraordinary time and in a domestic and foreign environment of unprecedented complexity that , by relying on the concerted efforts of the entire people to overcome various difficulties , we still accomplished the " 9th Five-Year " plan successfully , ensuring the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the national economy and comprehensively accomplishing the second strategic step in the drive to modernization .

Since in history imperialism used Catholicism and Protestantism to serve its national political interests , certain foreign missionaries relied on the unequal treaties to commit all kinds of outrages and caused over 1,500 large and small missionary cases [ jiao an ] , for which many Chinese lost their lives , and a number of Chinese Catholics also became innocent victims ; these historical wounds are still there in the hearts of the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church .  
Though the total amount of foreign capital utilized increased , the actual amount of foreign capital utilized dropped continuously due to last year 's drop in the contracted amount .  However , the contracted amount of foreign capital still reached $ 33.2 billion during the first eight months , up by more than 30 percent compared with the same period of last year .

and the East Asian countries have practiced a series of more favorable and open policies to attract foreign capital in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the Asian financial crisis .

The two parties agree to maintain consultations and exchanges between their foreign ministries ; to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern in a timely manner ; and to maintain regular contact and communication by taking advantage of various bilateral occasions , so as to vigorously push forward the development of relations between the two countries .  
At the 12th APEC Ministerial Conference being held here on 12 November , Tang Jiaxuan , minister of foreign affairs , and Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , respectively made a speech on the issues that cover , among other things , the economic and technological cooperation , the new economy , the development of human resources , the intensification of multilateral trade structure , and the trade and investment liberalization - - the principal subjects for discussion at the current conference .  
According to a financial official , the total quantity control of the no haste , be patient policy absolutely will have no precise restriction on figures , but will take foreign investment demand , the amount of domestic funds , and the rate of economic growth as indexes .  
pay close attention to the tests facing party building under complicated domestic and foreign situations , carry out in-depth study of outstanding problems existing within the party , and earnestly solve them according to the important ideas of the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , representing the direction of the advanced culture in China , and representing the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " ;  
Jiang Zemin said : Since the formation of the new Cambodian government , the two major ruling parties have , proceeding from the fundamental national and ethnic interests , cooperated unifiedly and worked hard to consolidate national reconciliation , developed the economy , actively developed foreign relations , and made tremendous achievements in domestic and foreign affairs work .  
In a scramble for news and in their usual flamboyant style , they actually published untrue reports saying " Bush Wins . " Not only did they cause the foreign media to commit the same mistake , they also made many countries ' governments issue congratulatory messages by mistake , leading to major diplomatic blunders .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The agreement on China 's accession to the WTO signed between China and the United States has broken the monopoly of China 's state-owned foreign trade enterprises over the import and export of agricultural products , and special stipulations have been made regarding the shares of imported agricultural products between the state-owned foreign trade enterprises and private enterprises .  It means that private enterprises must be granted more rights on foreign trade operations .  
The meeting maintained that , like cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange fraud , the crackdown on export rebate fraud is an important political assignment as well as an urgent economic struggle ; and that this struggle is greatly significant for tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , increasing revenues , and promoting a healthy economic development , as well as for managing the country according to the law and for consolidating and regulating the markets ' economic order and stamping out corruption in society .  
In recent years , the United States has become more and more aware of the challenge brought by the sudden rise of China and regarded this as " one of the greatest challenges in making foreign policies for the 21st century . "  Any view that ignores or neglects China 's role is shortsighted and harmful .  In particular , after the Asian financial crisis , the United States has noted that China 's big power image is moving in a " positive direction , " and that China is a responsible power that can be cooperated with .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
Shi Guangsheng said that although the bilateral trade value still accounts for a small proportion in the current foreign trade volumes of the two countries , China and Bahrain have great potential for further developing trade , contractual projects , cooperative labor services , and investment .  Thus , the two sides should make concerted efforts to promote various forms of mutual beneficial cooperation between enterprises of the two countries and to promote a greater development of bilateral economic and trade relations in the new century .  
The meeting was chaired by Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan , who is also chairman of the preparatory committee .  Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation and vice chairman of the preparatory committee , Chen Liangyu , executive vice mayor of Shanghai , and other leading comrades from relevant central and State Council departments and the municipal government of Shanghai attended the meeting .  
Just as Chinese assistant foreign minister Wang Yi put it , this meeting was very pragmatic and friendly and attained consummate success .  It is set to have a positive impact on the cooperation in East Asia under the framework of 10 + 3 and 10 + 1 .  
According to Dumas , the turning point for the Taiwan policy of the Paris authorities was when he was in power and vigorously promoted bilateral economic and trade relations between the two sides .  At that time , the establishment of " cultural centers " were approved and the diplomatic immunities of the Taipei Representative Office in France were upgraded similar to the special treatments enjoyed by " Quebec " of Canada . These pioneering measures which " stress " maintaining good relations with Taiwan were followed by all succeeding foreign ministers .  
Supported by foreign anti-China forces , Taiwan separatist forces put up a desperate struggle , and Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] proposed the " two-state theory , " which wrecked the political basis for the steady development of cross-strait relations and seriously threatened the prospects for peaceful reunification .  
While mapping out our scheme for investments in foreign countries in accordance with the " 10th Five-Year Plan , " we should do well the work of launching investment projects in the relevant trades and services in African countries .  We should support powerful and prestigious Chinese enterprises to make investments in African countries in the forms of processing abroad and foreign trade , set up cooperative projects compatible with the situation in Africa and help African countries develop their economy .  
Furthermore , they should closely serve the objectives and tasks of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " ; make relevant predictions and formulate countermeasures to deal with problems that might appear in the course of development ; strictly prevent and crack down on serious economic criminal activities including smuggling , fraudulence in foreign exchange transactions , obstruction of the order of financial management , financial fraudulence , and manufacturing and sales of fake and substandard commodities ;  
Its directly absorbed foreign capital has been increasing year after year , and by the end of this year , it may have absorbed a cumulative amount of $ 92.5 billion .  More than 250 of the world 's largest 500 enterprises have invested and established themselves in Shanghai , and they all rank among the nation 's top companies .  
Three days after the tragedy , Beijing has learned from domestic and foreign media that Dongguan people had strong dissatisfaction at the casualty tolls - - eight persons dead and 32 injured - - published by local government .  The Beijing high echelon has also learned from a reliable source that the death toll was more than eight and , therefore , believed that Dongguan is concealing the truth .  
Long Yongtu said : The increasing flow of foreign capital into China is neither based on the condition of decreasing the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries , nor will it have a significant impact on the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries .  Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .  
It is not likely that the additional foreign capital that has flowed into China will change the general pattern of the capital flow in the world , or affect the amount of foreign capital flowing into developing countries .  A large project given to China may give rise to the construction of supporting production networks in surrounding countries , thereby enabling these countries to obtain even more foreign capital .  This shows even more clearly the economic ties and complementary nature of China and other developing countries .  
In addition , a report published by a foreign firm Solomen Meibang [ name as transliterated ] , Taiwan 's banks currently have potential bad debts totaling NT $ 1.7 trillion to NT $ 2 trillion .  More enterprises are expected to default on their loans in the next six months , which would lead to bankruptcy of some peripheral financial institutions .  
It was learned that the hardware platforms of this kind generally used in China and foreign countries at present are priced at more than 500,000 yuan at least , while the hardware platform of this China-pioneered system is less than 20,000 yuan in price .  Specialists maintain that the successful development of this system has provided our military with a standardized , generalized , high-functional , and fairly cheap platform to develop the video system of battlefields , with China possessing the independent intellectual property .  
He maintained : The joint statement that the foreign ministers of the two countries are due to sign is a very important document , which will establish a sound legal framework and guiding principles for the development of relations between the two countries in the new situation , and which will give a strong impetus to bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
In addition , the vigor in the areas of attacking smuggling , trafficking of smuggled goods , foreign exchange fraud , illegal procurement of foreign exchange , the manufacture and sales of fraudulent goods , and other crimes has also clearly expanded , and the big legal cases of Liang Yaohua 's [ a high-level party official ] exceptionally large smuggling case , the Shantou City smuggling case , and others have been investigated and dealt with accordingly .  
Tang Jiaxuan said that at the invitation of the foreign ministers of Yugoslavia , Albania , Hungary , and Poland , he paid formal visits to the aforementioned four countries from 2-10 December . During his visits he held talks with the foreign ministers of the four countries , and met with the respective presidents , prime ministers , and parliamentary leaders of the four countries .  
Although participation in the process of European integration is the focus of their respective foreign policies , the four countries have also set a high value on China 's international status ; and they have shown admiration for the tremendous achievements that China has attained in its economic construction , and are willing to engage in cooperation of mutual benefit with China in all fields .  
Various experimental districts have summarized a lot of experience through practice.Deciding the boundaries of communities in a scientific and rational way is the prerequisite for building a modern and civil city .  Drawing on foreign experience and taking into account their local actual conditions , Tianjing , Shenyang , Benqi , Nanjing , Qingtao , Wuhan , Xian , Harbin and other cities decided the boundaries of a community in line with the geographical formation .  
The local departments in charge of economic and trade matters must tightly seize this advantageous time of economic growth and the opportunity of the country 's impending WTO accession to vigorously forge ahead , actively make breakthroughs , and work hard to open up new prospects in domestic and foreign trade .  
The election this year was held at a time when the US economy is prospering for the ninth successive year , the social environment is relatively stable , and the United States has maintained its strong international status .  According to convention , this domestic and foreign situation should benefit the ruling Democratic Party instead of the opposition Republican Party .  
The DPP 's numerous domestic policy changes , which are rife with contradictions , have accelerated foreign migration of industries and capital and caused severe depression in the stock market , depreciation of the Taiwan dollar , and considerable shrinkage of people 's assets .  
This grand occasion attracted the intense focus of the Chinese and foreign media - - more than a major sporting event would .  The official press proudly announced : " In this new millennium , Chinese private enterprises are finally seeing the light of day . "  
( 2 ) Governments at various levels will not be allowed to take part in joint ventures for mining operation , will not be allowed to set unreasonable economic demand on foreign businessmen , and will not be allowed to make wanton inspection , apportionment or increase fees in excess of those authorized by the law and regulations .  
However , Tien Hung-mao was unwilling to reconfirm Li Hsien-jen 's statements .  He stressed : Li Hsien-jen , as a convenor of the Foreign Affairs Committee , should be aware of the contents of such highly sensitive political statements .  Deputy Minister David Ta Wei Lee [ Li Ta-wei ] also pointed out on 18 December : Previously , because of their status in the opposition party , Bush 's personal aides who make decisions on foreign policies had opportunities to visit Taiwan and held talks with our government officials .  
It has been pointed out that based on evidence it had gathered over the years , the Investigation Bureau has found out that the customary tactics employed by the mainland are to put Chinese investment into foreign companies based in our country , have a hand in Taiwan 's stock market , and spread rumors in the market in an attempt to cause severe damage to our stock market and our economy .  
In addition , after China enters the WTO , Guangzhou City will make six major adjustments in its policies such as introduction of foreign capital .  The six adjustments include : Import tariffs will be lowered by a large margin .  The average tariffs will be gradually lowered to a level equivalent to that of developing countries within two years after China 's WTO accession ;  
In view of the grave situation where local and foreign triads are running rampant throughout the mainland and even infiltrating Chinese communist party and government organs , Beijing started a massive campaign to strike hard at triads across the land in September this year .  Initial results have been achieved .  After two months , 5,000 triad members involved in organized crime have been arrested .  
The police estimated that after the crackdowns in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first half of next year , they should be able to eliminate some of the larger local triads , fully curb the activities of foreign triads in the mainland , and bring about an obvious improvement in public order in the coastal areas .  
" There is no lack of senior government officials and expert scholars who are familiar with East Asian affairs , international foreign affairs , and military security in the core members of the new Bush cabinet .  The basic tone and route of the China policy from Washington tends to establish a pragmatism .  We have to deal with it in a calmer and more rational attitude of dealing with concrete matters relating to work . "  
However , Lin Zhongbing , who is familiar with the political situation of US , China , and Taiwan , thinks that , " I am afraid that if we have expectations that are too high , or we look forward to a dramatic change of our already decided policy of the realm of our foreign affairs international activities , it would be unrealistic . "  
American media started to call Clinton a " lame duck " before the curtain was raised on the election campaign in the first half of this year , meaning that as he was soon to leave office , domestic attention switched the new master of the White House who would replace him , while international opinion would gradually take an attitude of observation , so it would be hard to him to have much impact on domestic and foreign affairs in the future .  
Wu Yi said , under the " Ninth Five-year Plan , " China successfully overcame a series of foreign economic and trade problems , especially those created by the Asian financial crises ; the many undertakings continued to expand to become an important driving force behind the nation 's economic development , playing an important role in promoting macroeconomic stability and increasing the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
At the National Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Work Conference held in Beijing today , Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said that the anticipated objective of China 's total import and export amount for 2005 will be $ 650 billion , and that the scale of foreign direct investment absorbed in the next five years will remain at an average of $ 40 billion a year .  
Moreover , we should improve a financial structure for supporting foreign trade and economic cooperation focusing on export credits and export insurance , promote the organic combination of export credit insurance and export financing business , and establish a foreign-related economic and legal system , which is relatively perfect and conforms to WTO rules and China 's national condition ;  
The meeting called on public security organs at all levels to act in line with the central authorities ' plans , actively participate in the joint operations to deal strict blows to criminal activities of manufacturing and selling fake and inferior commodities , and the special struggle to deal strict blows to the fraud of export tax rebates , evasion and cheating in foreign exchange payments , and other criminal activities .  
Against this backdrop , China 's foreign affairs work in the fields of science and technology will be carried out closely around the science and technology development strategy , and will aim at cutting-edge science and technology in the international arena .  China will conduct international science and technology cooperation of a higher level on the basis of equality , mutual benefit , and shared achievements , enhance the country 's scientific and technological creation ability , develop advanced science and technology , and serve the industrialization of new technology .  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;  
The policies and measures involved in the circular included increasing construction fund , giving priority to launching construction projects , stepping up transfer of financial payment , strengthening support for financial loan , implementing a preferential taxation policy , implementing a preferential policy on land and mineral resources , further expanding the area of foreign investment , expanding the channel of foreign capital utilization , and increasing educational investment .  
This reporter learned from the ongoing National Work Conference on Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation held here that on behalf of China , the consulting body will fulfill over 100 information-related obligations as required by the WTO , give authoritative answers to questions from WTO member states about China 's trade policy , and provide consulting services for enterprises and the parties concerned in relation to WTO rules and foreign trade and economic policies .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .  
The introduction of these policies and measures is conducive to increasing fund input for the western development , improving the environment for investment in the western region , opening the western region still wider to both foreign and domestic investors , and giving greater support to the development of science , technology , education , and the training of talented personnel in the western region .  It will certainly produce an important effect in pushing forward the implementation of the large-scale western development strategy in a positive and orderly way .  
Zeng : To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should be adapted to the trend of economic globalization and China 's upcoming accession to the WTO , seize the opportunity of opening up still wider to foreign and domestic investors , enlarge the spheres of investment by foreign businessmen , broaden the channel of using foreign capital , make positive use of foreign loans , vigorously develop foreign economic relations and trade , and expand economic and technological exchange and cooperation with various countries in the world including the neighboring countries .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : In the 21st century , China will continue to resolutely and unwaveringly uphold the reform and opening-up policy and pursue an independent foreign policy of peace .  China will actively develop friendly and cooperative ties with all other countries , based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence , and strive to establish an equitable and rational world order in the political and economic arenas .  
Although its foreign aid amount rose to $ 14 billion in 1999 , it accounted for only 0.15 percent of its total output value that year , which was $ 9 trillion .  Moreover , $ 3 billion of this money was specifically reserved for its ally Israel and $ 2.1 billion for Egypt , which signed a peace treaty with Israel . France can be regarded as relatively generous .  
It is readily apparent that the new " cross-strait " structure of " eternal peace " and " political union " that the Taiwanese leader calls for is a " security structure " with a guaranteed " independent standing . "  Under an international strategic position , foreign powers would use this structure to " contain ( China 's ) surroundings " and extend Taiwan a protective umbrella .  
Insofar as Shanghai 's industrial sector at large is concerned , lower tariffs are expected to help textile enterprises , under structural readjustment at the moment , further invite or draw upon advanced foreign technology or products ; to enhance capabilities of developing or introducing new products with hi-tech contents ; or to accelerate structural readjustment as a whole .  
In improving the order of market the economy and developing the functions of customs , we should mainly launch incessant struggles against smuggling , work in coordination with concerned departments to crack down on tax rebate fraud , illegal remittance and procurement of foreign exchange and other criminal activities .  We should standardize various operations related to imports and exports , and maintain normal order in imports and exports .  
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [ HKSAR ] has not intervened or prohibited them .  With things continually developing in depth , however , people have paid closer attention to them and even worried that Hong Kong may be used as the " Falungong 's " activities " center " and become the " base " for foreign anti-China forces ' vain attempt to subvert the Chinese Government .  
After the meeting closed , Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , who attended the meeting , granted an exclusive interview with this reporter at which he talked about his views on the meeting 's outcome , the current situation and prospects of Asia-Europe cooperation , the Asian and European economic situations , foreign exchange mechanism , the prospects of East Asia regional cooperation , and other issues .  
At the State Administration of Exchange Control 's annual meeting this week , Lu Nanping , deputy director , said , amid the steady improvement in the national economic environment last year , China 's foreign exchange balance was able to maintain a good developmental trend ; the state 's foreign exchange reserve increased , and the RMB exchange rate remained basically stable .  
The century of striving by the Chinese nation in making consistent efforts to become stronger , working hard for national prosperity , resisting foreign bullying , and upholding unification has written a moving and tragic but glorious chapter , and laid the foundation for China 's development ; it shines through the ages , and all Chinese should be proud of it .  
It is learned that in the great development of the west , the state will delegate more extensive authorization to manufacturing enterprises in the western region to engage themselves directly in foreign trade , and will adopt a series of favorable policies to encourage the exports of good-quality and marketable products and the undertaking of overseas construction contracts and labor cooperation projects .  
When talking about his government 's foreign policy in his administrative policy speech , Yoshiro Mori said : In the first half of the 21st century , Japan 's basic diplomatic strategy in the Asia-Pacific region will be based on its alliance with the United States and oriented to strengthening the friendly ties with the ROK , its neighbor , and maintaining a stable pattern in the Asia-Pacific region through building up mutually trusted and harmonious relations with China and Russia .  
Moreover , we should base ourselves on China 's realities and conscientiously sum up and utilize our own successful experience in training and managing our athletes on one hand and , on the other hand , persist in opening to the outside world , continue to draw on the good practices of foreign countries which are conducive to raising the level of our athletics , make full use of the modern science and technology to enhance the quality of training , and enable China 's athletics to attain a still greater development in the new century .  
By listing themselves overseas , China 's enterprises are not only able to raise funds for faster development , but also make use the listing to change the original unilateral capital structure of sole government ownership .  With the change of capital structure , it is able to develop enterprises under the mixed form of ownership with the participation of foreign investment , establish a corporate legal person management structure with diversified investments , and further build a modern enterprise system .  
This source also said that the Beijing authorities have had evidences showing that the foreign journalists detained on that day had known beforehand that " Falungong " practitioners would engage in fierce activities in Tiananmen Square . After verifying that these journalists really involved themselves in the drawing up of the plot for this incident , the Beijing authorities will not rule out taking legal actions against these journalists on charge of intentional murder because they " had instigated and assisted others to commit suicide . "  
These people are subject to the manipulation of foreign powers and the harmful leadership of a heretical teaching .  The ideology is extreme , the behavior is boundless , and it is very difficult to guarantee that a self-burning incident like the one in Tiananmen will not happen in Hong Kong or perhaps yet another burning tragedy in the country .  
They acted in cahoots with some organizations opposing the central government and harassing Hong Kong , worked in concert with the inland " Falungong " cult organization , and cooperated closely with foreign anti-China forces to do whatever they pleased by exploiting Hong Kong 's special political environment .  They directed the spearhead of their attack at the central government and the Special Administrative Region government , causing great worries and restlessness among the great majority of Hong Kong residents .  
Since the beginning of 2000 , the volume of contracted foreign investment has rapidly recovered and begun to climb up , driven by the effect of the pending WTO accession and a major turnaround in China 's domestic economy .  However , the volume of actual foreign investment continued to drop , due to the delayed effect from the drop of contracted foreign investment in the previous year .  By the end of November , the amount of foreign investment in real terms was 2.29 percent lower than the same period of the previous year .  
To do a good job of attracting foreign investment under the new circumstances , the crucial thing is to uphold the policy of actively and effectively attracting foreign capital and vigorous raise the quality and level of foreign investment while focusing closely on the needs of our national economic development and restructuring .  
Because China 's relevant legal code is still not quite sound and comprehensive , its market mechanism not quite mature , and its capital market not fully open , some 70 percent of direct foreign investment in China are through joint venture and cooperation , with only a portion invested in wholly-owned companies .  Foreign investment through takeover and merger is still limited .  This will limit the massive flow of foreign capital .  
Ma Yingjiu accepted intensive interviews from Taiwan , Hong Kong , China , and foreign media yesterday .  He pointed out that his trip was not for the reason of improving cross-strait relations .  His visit to Hong Kong was helpful for exchanges between the two cities , promoting the improvement of Taiwan-Hong Kong relations , and building a harmonious atmosphere .  Indirectly , it also improved cross-strait relations .  This benefits our central government as well .  
President Chen pointed out that as a state leader , he deeply understands the implications of cross-Strait relations on domestic politics , foreign relations , economy and trade , national defense and other sectors .  He described this as " a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole . "  He also recognized the popular wish for a " stable and peaceful situation in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Shi Fenghai pointed out : It is expected that foreign capital will be concentrated first in high-profit business fields and areas - - international and domestic long-distance calls , IP telephony , Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , and other important eastern areas will become the key business fields and areas which foreign capital will enter .  
Being a developing country , China can not afford to send an excessive amount of capital abroad at this stage .  Having considered changes in our macroeconomic situation , we decided to raise a new topic , namely , allowing mainland residents to invest in the B-share market with legitimate earnings in foreign exchange .  
Answer : Generally speaking , they will have to prepare themselves in the following three ways : First , they should change their rules governing trading in the B shares and make public on an earlier date concrete measures for mainland investors with legitimate foreign exchange funds to open a B-share account and a capital account ;  
The gradual and conditional opening of the B share market in China will greatly promote the process of internationalization of the Chinese securities markets and make good preparations for the realization of an unified , and open international securities markets , where the free exchange of renminbi for foreign money can be realized while dealing with capital items in the future .  
( 3 ) Compared with his economic achievements , Clinton was weak and inept in diplomatic strategy .  Since it is very difficult for Bush to demonstrate his economic aptitude within a short period of time , he has to use underhand method to score some points first in foreign affairs .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .  
Presently , excessive export of capital is still unsuited for China , being a developing country .  Allowing domestic residents to invest in B shares with their legally owned foreign currencies , therefore , is a new subject stemming from the changes in the macroeconomic situation .  
A person in charge of the CSRC said that the current policy readjustment was made mainly due to the consideration that marked changes have taken place in the macroeconomic situation regarding the capital movement of foreign exchange in China , and corresponding adjustments to the market orientation , rules , functions , and so on have been put forward in line with the requirements of the national economic development .  
Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
Those attending today 's forum unanimously held : Putting forward this important thinking is of profound theoretical and practical significance , and it is a scientific thesis reached on the basis of summing up foreign and domestic experiences in governing countries as well as an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory of states ; it is also an important overall strategy for running the country put forward at a time when our country is entering a new stage of economic and social development .  
As the principal responsible person of a local party committee , he abandoned the proper political responsibility of a leading cadre , discarded the principles of party spirit , became a crony of an illicit foreign businessman , went in for bartering power for money in a big way , led a number of cadres astray , damaged the party style and social atmosphere , ruined the party 's image , and damaged state interests , causing serious consequences to local economic and social development .  
In the past five years , the 11th Panchen Lama has been accorded great kindness by high priests of Tibetan Buddhism and the worship and support of the vast number of believers .  He has received numerous local and foreign living Buddhas and high priests , held many religious meetings for the monks , and touched the heads of followers to bless them .  
In the face of WTO challenges , such as increased imports and foreign advanced marketing methods , Wang Jinshan said , supply and marketing cooperatives departments and affiliated organizations nationwide should make use of their limited time to further intensify reform , quicken the pace of development , and meet challenges with a positive posture .  
It is common knowledge that the Tiananmen area is an important venue where the party and the state hold major state and diplomatic events and a high-profile mecca for Chinese and foreign tourists .  It is the political , cultural , and international exchange center of our country and represents and symbolizes the Chinese nation , so it occupies an extremely important position .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
At the turn of the century , China 's economy is facing a great deal of opportunities and challenges against the domestic and international background : After more than 20 years of reform and opening up , the domestic market has shaken off the longstanding condition of short supply , the structure of a market economy has been established in a preliminary form , and a fundamental change has occurred in foreign economic relations ;  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
We are also facing the arduous tasks of reforming the education and scientific research systems , the administrative system , the financial system , the investment system , the taxation system , the foreign trade system , the social security system , the income distribution system , the medical and public health system , and especially the leadership system , the economic system , and the management systems in all aspects .  In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
Delegate Jiang Demin believes that " We must improve the economic value for intellectuals .  Although domestic treatment still can not compare with that of foreign countries , we can adopt some special , favorable policies to permit talent returned from overseas to draw a certain percentage of sharing in the profits from their technologies , and permit them to hold multiple positions and salaries . "  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
All the increase and reduction have expressed a kind of spirit of " seeking progress while ensuring stability . "  The budget has not done anything harmful to current social stability , economic recovery , or long-term healthy economic development , but has promoted what is conducive to improving the business environment , attracting foreign investment , and encouraging the training of capable personnel .  In this way , the increase and reduction of taxes and charges have been used to readjust the government 's financial revenue and expenditure and to promote social and economic development .  
In answering a relevant question raised by a foreign journalist , Zhu Bangzao said that the US military spending this year is $ 14 billion more than last year and this increase is almost equivalent to China 's national defense spending last year .  Double standard should not be used on this issue .  
In conformity with the requirements for WTO accession , " local content , " " export performance " and other stipulations that are inconsistent with WTO rules will be removed from this basic law for foreign investment which paved the way for the rush of foreign investors into the country .

Competition in the aspect of agricultural development comes more often from the foreign market than from the domestic market .

Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
It is necessary to further improve the investment environment , formulate policies that will encourage investment in geographic survey , prospecting and developing mineral resources in the western areas , guiding domestic and foreign investors to making investment in the western areas , and promoting the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of mining industries in the western areas .

But over these eighty years , sweeping changes have taken place in our country , which we are all proud to see .  China has evolved from a country plagued by foreign invasion and domestic upheavals to a stable and peaceful nation exercising the rule of law , from a backward and isolated country to a nation that has opened up and become stronger through the promotion of science and technology , and from a poverty-stricken country to a nation with a rising standard of living .

Its recent history of ample foreign exchange reserves has given it an excellent credit rating and has attracted substantial investment from multinational firms , not to mention raising the country 's international standing .  
This year , too , we are lowering personal and corporate income taxes , reducing tariffs , further relaxing restrictions on foreign investment , and increasing public investment , while the 14 major development projects will be moving from the planning stage into that of actual construction .  
Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates . In addition , should a foreign customer fail to make good on his payments , the bank will reimburse the Chinese firm and take legal action overseas to recover the debt .  
The Bureau of Entry and Exit has announced that " young overseas students " wishing to return home may apply to the various Ministry of Foreign Affairs foreign representatives for special passports . The measure is designed to smooth procedures for young overseas students wishing to return home . Should there be no problem regarding military service , they may leave the country again through normal procedures .  
Looking at this list it is obvious that the foreign tourists ' knowledge of scenic spots relies on outdated information , and that recently developed scenic areas , such as the northern and eastern coasts and Orchid Island have not been sufficiently promoted abroad . This , in the end , is a great loss for the tourists themselves . "  
A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
Our economic growth rate has averaged 8.5 percent over the past ten years , an accomplishment which is the focus of world attention . Like a growing adolescent , full of boundless potential , we 're of great interest to overseas investors , " says Shen Po-ling , explaining why ROC stocks are desired so much by foreign investors .  
If local people are responsible for some mistake , a foreign administrator had best not make an issue of it in public , or the perceived assault is liable to boomerang as one is labelled a " racist . "  
In the late 1970 ' s the local film scene acquired a new look . The Motion Picture Development Foundation film library , founded in 1978 with the support of the Government Information Office , began to systematically introduce famous European films and top-notch local works to its members . And starting in 1980 , an international film festival has been held every year in conjunction with the Golden Horse Awards to show foreign art films ( together with some high-standard commercial films ) nominated for the awards .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
The scene was northern China , the language spontaneous and sometimes colloquial , and the mood ranging from nostalgia to humor . This was followed by impressionistic pieces on foreign lands , such as Paris and London , which coincided with the period of exoticism in the late fifties but are unmistakably individual because of their dramatic rather than merely lyrical treatment .  
The call for monetary internationalization has been loud and clear recently . It has also become the vogue of our times . After World War , as international investment and international trade expanded , the international money market also experienced rapid development . Banks from various economically advanced nations established branches in foreign countries one after another , thus becoming a part of the close-knit international money market network .  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
In the area of economic liberalization and internationalization , we have opened our market wide to foreign products by slashing import tariffs , breaking down other barriers to imports , and streamlining customs procedures . We have implemented a floating exchange rate , relaxed controls on foreign exchange , and are encouraging foreign investment .  
But this April a case was discovered in which the individual , a homosexual , had never been abroad and had no foreign sexual partners . This case shattered the myth that one was safe by avoiding foreigners and generated a certain panic " in the circle . "  
" The Chinese critical tradition is a weighty burden that often proves stifling . " He believes that this is another difficulty for many foreign sinologists : " It 's very hard to escape from the burden , to redefine the literary standing of a minor poet , reverse the opinions of the past , or find new meaning in a work . "  
A total of 653 international direct-dial public telephones will be installed at a wide variety of locations , including airports , harbors , train stations , tourist hotels , airline companies , tourist spots , large hospitals , major streets in commercial districts , universities , highway rest stops , industrial science parks , foreign affairs and trade centers , international activity centers , and the directorate 's main business offices .  
Despite its foreign origins in both physical reality and artistic representation , the pomegranate has been able to express even more of its charm in China . Well suiting the Chinese national spirit , it has long been broadly popular among the people , as well as marking a pleasant footnote in the history of cultural and artistic interchange between East and West . (  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
The formation of regional economic organizations that is now in the ascendant will certainly create trade barriers , deepening the intensity of competition . - - The effect of newly industrialized countries entering the international trade battlefield with their rich forces in the future can not be overlooked . - - The foreign debt of the Third World continues to grow , forming another variable that is deeply troubling to all countries of the world .  
Per Capita Income by the Year 2000By the year 2000 , the per capita gross national product in the Republic of China on Taiwan will exceed US $ 20,000 , a level comparable to per capita income in the highly industrialized countries of the West , and one which ranks her among the top twenty countries of the world . Estimates are that by that time the ROC 's foreign trade turnover will reach US $ 350 billion , which will make the ROC the tenth biggest trading country in the entire world .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Mrs . Wang was worried about what gift to send to her friends who had emigrated abroad . Little did she suspect that she would reap an unexpected harvest in accompanying a foreign friend to the museum . While her friend was buying a souvenir of the visit , Mrs . Wang casually looked around , and discovered some cushions printed with the Chinese characters for wealth , good fortune , longevity , and happiness in marriage set high up on the counter .  
During his military career , Hau cultivated a broad understanding of international politics , foreign affairs , science and technology , and social and mainland affairs , but observed a strict separation between the military and politics .  
In order to ensure normal economic growth and release inflationary pressure , the Central Bank decided to adopt a policy of financial stringency as from March of this year and the money supply growth rate has steadily fallen from its original 30% ; another factor which caused there to be less cash in circulation in Taiwan was purchases of foreign currency by many people who anticipated that the NT dollar would depreciate .  
The agricultural mission not only helps Malawi develop agriculture but also serves our foreign service community there by providing them with fresh produce and playing the role of general jacks-of-all-trades and Mr . Fix-it 's . If the car breaks down , if it has a flat tire , if the screen door 's stuck , if you need some styrofoam or nylon cord for packing , if you 're short a blanket and pillow for a guest . . . just track down a team member and you 're sure to come away satisfied .  
Premier Hau Pei-tsun has stated that the government wants to ensure a healthy stock market , not rescue it . The Ministry of Finance has also firmly turned down suggestions from certain deputies and businessmen to lower the securities transaction tax so as to stimulate a recovery in share prices . Instead , regulations are being revised to encourage financially sound companies to list their shares on the market and to allow foreign institutions to enter the market , as a viable means of nudging the local stock market towards full maturity .  
But in fact the supposed tradition stretched back no further : my teachers ' teachers , many of them scholars of foreign origin , were the generation that had established Chinese studies in Britain on a professional footing . They had to learn a lot more by themselves and it was hard to find a good teacher , J . K . Fairbank reveals that when he arrived at Oxford in the 1930s , eager to learn Chinese , Soothill left him to fend for himself .  
The Forest School should n't be special - - it 's just trying to put into practice ideals repeatedly stressed by Chinese and foreign educators . " No cramming ; no corporal punishment ; balanced education in ethics , knowledge , physical education , social skills , and arts ; allowing the children to become the lead actors in the study process " and other concepts all have their chance to be realized here .  
With English as its official language , obviating the need to learn another foreign language , along with its relative proximity to Taiwan , its similarity in climate and its spacious and comfortable living environment , Australia makes for a highly competitive choice .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired . The discussion revolved around living in a foreign land , coming to terms with the new land and the old , where the future of China was headed and so forth . Everyone talked in full confidence , unable to stop , and the seminar did n't break up until one o'clock at night .  
Although air forces on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have not really tangled since 1958 and there 's no way of measuring the ROC Air Force 's true capabilities , occasional contacts with foreign pilots gives the tactical training center the chance to compare flying skills .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
" In the past . everybody assumed that all a high-tech company needed was technology to be successful . Later it was discovered that management skills are also required , " points out Hong . According to their studies of domestic and foreign experiences , the cause of failure of many companies is by no means that the product is poor , but that management is unsatisfactory .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
What impressed me most about the museum was not only the amazing collections , the good preservation , the quality of the abundant publications or the nice the tea-room and garden ; I spent a lot of time talking with the museum staff , even going to the store rooms to see and discuss various items with them . I felt that it was these people who were really the showcase . Young and educated in Taiwan , it seemed that every one of them had more than one foreign language .  
" External trade had shown a large surplus for several years running , and there was a great deal of idle capital in private hands ; moreover the NT dollar was appreciating , and speculative foreign money poured in , add to this that the policy of ' returning price increases to the general public ' had not been effectively implemented over the long run , and land became a highly profitable investment , " says Hsieh Chao-yi , an associate professor in the graduate program in urban planning at Chung-hsing University .  
" We have to fight as few battles that we 're not sure of winning as possible to avoid wasting limited resources on meaningless frays , " says Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien , who states that our current foreign policy is oriented mainly toward regional , economic and functional areas .  
At present , the ROC 's total external trade is fifteenth largest in the world ; GNP is ranked 25th in the world , even exceeding Luxembourg , an OECD member ; twenty continuous years of trade surpluses have accumulated one of two largest - - if not the largest - - foreign exchange reserves in the world ; foreign investment in Southeast Asia is second only to Japan .  
But the detailed contents - - whether or not in the future an agency specially responsible for foreign aid will be established , exactly what the foreign aid ratio should be , whether diplomatic or economic considerations should be predominant - - have not yet been determined .  
" In fact the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and high foreign exchange reserves are not directly or necessarily linked with speculative fever or inflation . What is important is looking at how policy in the financial markets is carried out and supporting their stability , " says Lu Fang-ching , deputyexecutive secretary of the Commodity Price Supervisory Board at the Ministry of Economic Affairs examining the problem from another angle . " The point is that the central bank , compared to five years ago , is more experienced and very cautious . "  
When the island 's deep water port , international airport , and plentiful supply of cheap labor are considered , it is clear why Penang has received so much attention from foreign investors .  
Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
The salary of a locally born maid is about NT $ 20,000 , while the average for a foreign national is only about NT $ 15,000 , " points out an executive-level professional woman employed in a foreign corporation , who has hired both local and foreign-born help , " and besides , these days only middle aged grannies are willing to work as domestics in Taiwan , and they are very selective themselves , and have a lot of demands like vacation or raises . "  
In the 1960s the government struggled to obtain foreign exchange . Under a policy of forcefully pursuing industrial development , record numbers of trees were cut . In 1960 the Yuli Forest District Office was established , and the forest compartments upstream continued to send down such top-grade conifers as red spruce and cypress and such broad-leaved trees as the Nanmu and Formosan Michelia .  
In the era when " cutting trees for foreign exchange " was the principal aim of the Republic of China 's forest policy , the Yuli District Forest Office preserved a stand of 60 stout camphor trees by the middle stretches of the Chingshui River . As the only remaining virgin tract of stout camphors , which are broad-leafed trees native to Taiwan , the stand has today become an essential resource in an effort to return Chingshui River to its original ecology .  
There is tremendous pressure that accumulates from one year of studies being judged all at once , " says Chen Chuan-sheng , a third year doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering who is also an assistant teacher and responsible for helping Belgian students with their theses . It 's not only foreign students who , because of the language problem , are scared of the oral exams . The Belgians are terrorized by this decisive test too . "  
To each his strengths : Before economic reforms were implemented on the mainland , emphasis was placed on " standing on one 's own feet . " Hence , scientists were cut off from information about foreign technology and were forced to grope around in the dark . Yet in this way we gained some technological development experience , especially in a few specialized areas .  
Q : It is hard to escape the conclusion that in the past the government 's attitude toward the protection of foreign intellectual property rights has been " whether or not this is beneficial for us or harmful for us . " But this time Premier Hau Peitsun clearly stated that infringement of intellectual property rights is a kind of theft - - the perspective is already shifting from " gain or loss " to " right and wrong . "  
The best is yet to come ! Successful research on a stereo piano that has received the affirmation of a foreign piano manufacturer sounds exciting . But for Yang Tai-ho , who designed the stereo piano ten years ago and acquired a patent for it five years ago , it 's just one of 200 patents .  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Besides a strong legislature , with the development of democratic politics , various interest groups are both " numerous and vocal " with their opinions . For example , there were endless disputes over land acquisition and the proposed routes of transportation projects , which all affected the pace of the projects . This caused the foreign firms who were anxious to get their orders settled to have to wait off to the side chomping at the bit .  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Vuu Khai Thanh , initiator of what was then the Binhtien Imex Cooperative Society , relied on hard work and struggle , and the advantages of distributing low-priced goods with insignificant labor costs to Southeast Asia . In 1989 , he received the first license to be issued by the government permitting a private enterprise to engage in direct foreign trade . It was only this that landed him the opportunity to leave the country for an observation tour and go to Taiwan to find technological and management partners , thus speeding up the expansion of the business .  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
But when you look a little closer , the slightly bent back , the thinning hair , and the fingers , misshapen and arthritic from overwork , all unintentionally reveal the marks left on him by long and arduous effort and by the passage of time . God 's will : Thirty-two years . The time this foreign doctor has spent in Taiwan just happens to be same as that spent in his native land . "  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
A bird in the hand : This may be the case , but in looking at current efforts to breed wild animals in captivity , the Council of Agriculture takes a more practical tack , asking scholars to gather data widely and hoping they will refer to the experimental models used by foreign studies of primates . The council is also drawing up guidelines for the breeding of protected wild animal species . At appropriate times it will provide human-bred monkeys to be used by research units . "  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners . Tuo tea , a variety of Pu'er whose cakes are shaped like bowls , won gold medals two years running in contests held in Spain and Germany .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
With the recent rapid economic growth in Taiwan , political liberalization , and a successful switch to a more practical approach to foreign policy , the ROC 's international status has risen , and some of the reasons used in the past for obtaining foreign passports no longer exist .  
My friends and I do n't think that we 've been ill treated on account of our ROC passport , " says Jackson G . S . Chi , a dentist at the Yelling Dental Clinic who frequently goes abroad to attend international conferences as a representative of our national camping association . He thinks this must be an opinion held by some ROC citizens as a result of their own shortcomings - - their lack of poise or inability to communicate with foreign customs officers .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
Better than some , worse than others : From a document on which most foreign governments were loath to put their stamps ( issuing visas to ROC citizens on separate sheets of paper ) , to today 's highly esteemed darling of black marketeers and international thieves , the ROC passport has come a long way fast .  
He indicates that the excessive accumulation of foreign reserves has led to an excess of floating capital and rampant money games and speculation ; land prices have skyrocketed and stocks have soared upward , so that the gap in income between rich and poor has become more pronounced .  
His chance finally came in June of that year when an injured foreign player for the Giants was put on the disabled list . This freed up a spot on the major league roster , and Lu filled it . " I did n't think I 'd play for a while after coming up , " Lu recalls , " and was caught by surprise when manager Wang Chen-chih put me in the starting lineup . "  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
He believes that one of the main reasons why Taiwan fell into the hands of foreign rulers for half a century of its modern history was that the island 's rich mineral deposits had aroused the greed of other nations .  
He was expelled from his church senior high school for questioning the school 's rule that everyone had to attend prayers . When he was studying at Taiwan University 's foreign languages department , dissatisfied with the way that prose literature classes merely consisted of going through texts with a dictionary without any real critical discussion of the works ' artistic and rhetorical merit , he would often get into arguments with his teachers , and because of this was always given fail marks .  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women . " This brought a sudden quiet , but many younger Hakka women silently approved of the professor 's comments .  
Beginning two years ago , foreign conservation groups started attacking Taiwan as a " rhino terminator , " and then in April of this year Taiwan became the first country against which the United States implemented trade sanctions for ecological reasons . The Chinese medical community has become a favorite public punching bag . As a doctor of Chinese medicine , Huang Ming-teh has had to face this problem .  
Chung Chin explains that she used data for 1991 because it made calculations relatively simple . In 1991 the PRC was strongly encouraging foreign firms to go all out to export goods and earn foreign exchange , and Taiwan firms were given little access to the domestic market . Therefore using total Taiwanese investment in the economic formula to calculate the contribution made to mainland Chinese exports would give a close approximation to the actual figure .  
Land is state property , and most people live in homes owned by their work units , so that these can not serve as collateral for " start-up capital . " Another reason why private enterprise is having a hard time burgeoning is because " government policy is tilted in favor of foreign and Taiwan investors . " It is still up in the air whether or not the mainland can duplicate Taiwan 's development experience .  
When they play matchmaker for unsuspecting foreign firms , they often introduce them to inefficient enterprises . In the end not only were mainland industries not saved from their doldrums , even the foreign businesses involved in cooperative investment were dragged down into the vortex , suffering greatly . Time to sink or swim " Now the way of thinking has changed , " Zhang Zhiqun explains .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest . Yet local private enterprises , which , like quails , are small in stature but large in number , have not been given the attention they deserve . They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
He was unexpectedly called back to China to attend to his mother 's burial , and found himself ground to a halt in Jimei for two years , not a particularly easy base for launching foreign ventures . Then surprisingly his father 's enterprise went bankrupt , squandered into a penniless state by his father 's second wife . Tan had no choice but to start from scratch , running a rice store and a pineapple factory .  
He practiced medicine in his " Pochilum Clinic . " In an age of turmoil when China was weak and prey to Western invaders , with one hand he struck at the foreign sowers of intrigue and disorder , and with the other he fought against the corrupt and treacherous elements within China which sprang up to bedevil the country in its hour of difficulty . In the Chinese cinema of the l990s , the heroic figure of Huang Fei-hong bears strong parallels with Bruce Lee , who was the sensation of the film world 20 years ago .  
In the films , Bruce Lee played such roles as a student in a martial arts training school in one of the foreign concessions in the early years of the Republic of China , or a lonely Chinese expatriate going to Southeast Asia or the West to try and make a living . Faced with inevitable bullying and insults from Westerners and Japanese , he would endure their repeated taunts , suppressing his anger until he could yield no further and all his pent-up ire would burst out .  
In light of the current situation , the country will need professionals skilled in R &amp; D , foreign languages and simultaneous interpretation ; people who are possessed of an international perspective and are also familiar with the characteristics of international markets ; as well as practical personnel who have a good grasp of such aspects as finance , transportation , and communication in the operation of international business .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
In 1932 China 's Minister of Industry Kung Ta , a 72nd generation descendant of Confucius , presented them as a gift to the school of journalism . And since the lions crossed the wide ocean and settled down in this foreign land , new arrivals who set their eyes on them usually gain the warm feeling of bumping into old friends in a strange place .  
Yet when ordinary folks hear that the total budget for many of the things they care about most - - such as the judicial system , the legislative process , legal affairs , civil administration , foreign policy , or relations with mainland China - - adds up to less than 10% of total outlays ( the same level as interest payments ) , they are at a loss for words .  
Meanwhile , China 's painters , living amidst domestic turmoil and foreign invasion , felt the pressure of disappearing traditions . Forced to absorb the creative techniques and methods of the West , China 's painters devoted their efforts to the reform of traditional painting , seeking an East-West fusion of technique . The content of their paintings abounded in themes of ethnic consciousness . Western painting thus followed completely different courses of development in China and Taiwan .  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
Since , Chen argued , it is impossible to be completely loyal to two separate entities at the same time , it is only proper that parliamentarians should give up dual nationality . Following this logic , the government stipulated in the 1991 amendments to the Election and Recall Law that those elected as representatives must give up foreign citizenship before they are sworn into office .  
Although the intended targets of sanctions were countries that over-exploited resources held in international waters , the amendment included a provision to the effect that whenever the secretary of commerce or secretary of the interior learns of trade or other forms of exchange , by foreign nationals , that directly or indirectly harms international conservation programs for endangered or threatened species , they should submit certification of this fact to the president .  
And it was n't until very recently , when the problem of strays became very serious , that environmental agencies began strengthening their dog catching functions . With domestic dog lovers raising angry cries , conservation groups here are saying that dog-catching as it is now practiced is cruel , and they have invited foreign animal protection groups to teach sanitation personnel " how to catch dogs humanely . "  
One of his reasons for writing was to correct some misconceptions about Ming furniture , because " strictly speaking they [ the early foreign collectors ] were biased , for they neglected the fact that there is also a side to Ming furniture of fine carving and intricate decoration , which of course is quite different from the elaborate ornamentation of Qing dynasty palace-style furniture . "  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
But one aspect is confusing : last year , Taiwan 's foreign trade performance was outstanding , with both exports and imports breaking the US $ 100 bn barrier to set all-time records ; also , the trade surplus rose for the first time after falling for four years running , and exceeded US $ 8 bn .  
Michael Chen of the Government Information Office was one of the key persons responsible for taking care of all the incoming foreign media . Based on prior experience ( 120 foreign reporters for the elections two years ago and 160 foreign reporters for the elections last year ) , Chen 's office estimated that about 250 personnel would arrive from abroad to cover the presidential race .  
Afterwards , they began to perform xiang sheng in Taiwanese . The first time , the story was about a foreign preacher inviting over a Taiwanese interpreter to help him deliver a big sermon . The humor of language misunderstanding was thus unveiled . For example , " Today I 've come to preach [ bodao ] in this honorable [ gui ] place " was interpreted as , " Today I come to this ghostly [ also pronounced gui ] place to spread rice shoots [ also pronounced bodao ] . "  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
In the late 1940s , the then bustling and cosmopolitan Shanghai rejoiced at having survived World War II relatively unscathed . But when the red tide of communism flooded through China , it marked the end for the city : foreign and Chinese entrepreneurs alike were swept out through its gates and their assets seized by the state .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .  
The nation 's second highest official furtively flying off to foreign soil to engage in " secret diplomacy " brought varying reactions : Some members of the media described his departure as a virtually supernatural " disappearance , " and the opposition questioned if such a mission was n't better suited to a secret ambassador than a high-ranking executive official , at least until there was a major foreign-relations breakthrough with Ukraine .  
Even after you have graduated from university or graduate school , there are still all kinds of career-training buxibans that will help you cross over to a new profession , prepping you for the national civil service exam , TOEFL , overseas university entrance exams , qualifying licensing examinations , and even specialized tests for journalism or the foreign service .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
With the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the 1640s China once again fell under the rule of a foreign people . At this time the accomplished plum painter Shi Tao , whose prospects of a brilliant civil service career were dashed by the Qing conquest , wrote this poem to the plum flower : " The green mountains and bright moon are the same as they always were and will be .  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
The combined effects of ROC foreign policy and cross-strait relations make this stage of ROC foreign relations extremely unusual . How does Chang , an old foreign-affairs hand , who studied international politics and entered the diplomatic corps nearly 30 years ago , and who bears the high expectations of the people , plan to steer the ROC diplomatic ship through these troubled times ?  
" I 'll probably select paintings relatively Western in composition and in use of color , " says Yen Shen-jer , somewhat reluctantly . He notes that the classic Chinese ink painting artistic idiom , with its vivid moods , uninhibited yet subtle inks and impressionistic approach to nature , is not something that Westerners can simply understand at a glance . Therefore , in order to open doors for a foreign audience , it is necessary to make things accessible .  
In addition to Wistaria 's old friends and acquaintances , foreign travelers who had heard of the teahouse abroad and ventured here to see it were also shocked that half of it had been boarded up . People were afraid that no one would maintain the closed off section ; the garden would turn into a tangle of weeds and a haven for insects . Water collecting on the roof would surely damage the wooden structure .  
But the EEA has turned these disputes into public matters , and now a firm catching a competitor taking its trade secrets can file a complaint with the FBI , which can use the federal government 's resources to pursue the investigation . The FBI can also legally set up " stings " to raise the conviction rate in trade secret cases . It is tantamount to encouraging American firms to strike out foreign rivals that are threatening them .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
The reason for the change in their itinerary was that , like every other previous foreign excursion by top-ranking officials of the ROC , Vice President Lien 's trip was met the entire way with pressure from Beijing . Firstly , after the senior officials of the ROC and Iceland met , PRC foreign affairs spokesman Shen Guofang issued a strongly worded criticism . He asserted that Prime Minister Oddson was interfering in " the internal affairs of China " and damaging relations between the PRC and Iceland , and that Iceland would be responsible for the consequences .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
Speaking of the focus of future foreign relations , he says that they will first be directed at countries with whom Taiwan has formal ties . The secondary focus will be " pragmatic diplomacy " and the active pursuit of participation in international organizations . After these will be special areas which will be dealt with in special manners .  
Southeast Asia and the mainland entice firms with their low production costs and their market potential . In addition , about 70% of the economic strength of the region is concentrated in the hands of Chinese business people who , in turn , are closely tied to Taiwanese business people . This drew many Taiwanese to the region more than 10 years ago , making them some of Southeast Asia 's earliest foreign investors .  
As of the end of 1997 , the Catholic church in Taiwan was operating 46 middle and primary schools , two universities , one technical college , 17 homes for the elderly , and seven halfway houses for troubled youth . In addition , various parishes include centers to assist aboriginal people , foreign laborers working in Taiwan ( including many Filipino Catholics ) , and those on the fringes of society .  
Recently Cardinal Shan has been promoting the establishment of a Catholic benevolent fund , and the strengthening of service to aboriginal people , foreign workers , the poor and ill , and those in prison . Moreover , the Taiwan Catholic Church is planning a major conference on " New Good News for the New Century , " to be held in 2000 , in the hope of helping Taiwan society as it adjusts to rapid change .  
According to ROC law , when a ship takes a foreign registry , when its catch is sent back to Taiwan , it is treated as imported , and customs taxes must be paid . This is a heavy burden . Moreover , to prevent the industry growing excessively and exhausting resources , the government gives only a limited number of licenses . Ships may be scrapped and replaced , but no new ones may be added .  
This recognition returned me again to thinking about that tension experienced by the expatriate between the nagging desire to retreat back to one 's own country and the dogged intention to stay where one is . And it suggested some common ground between the fear and fascination I see written on the face of the two-year-old who comes upon me in the mall and my own fascination with the specter , every day repeated , on sidewalks all around me filled with " foreign " Asian faces .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
The same survey showed that more than half of unemployed people were unwilling to take up available work because of low pay . This might be taken to mean that many people have inflated expectations , and have succumbed to a philosophy of wanting to find well-paid , cushy jobs close to home . But deeper analysis shows that the government 's modified policy on importing foreign labor may also be to blame .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there . Now , 63 years after part of the National Palace Museum collection first went to Europe for a show in London in 1935 , works from the museum are going to Paris .  
Lee Su Yue , herself having lived in a foreign land , has always been greatly touched by the story of the lonely and brokenhearted Wang Zhaojun , who was married out to a barbarian chieftain of the western hinterlands and buried in an alien country .  
Lee could hardly have told us much of anything new in his memoirs , for he had already devoted a tremendous effort during 30 years in office to the task of recounting the events that preceded the founding of the republic . Furthermore , Singapore has been deeply influenced by its long years under British rule . The Singaporean government maintains copious records concerning all its domestic and foreign affairs . Political statements over the years have drawn upon a large body of diplomatic documents , parliamentary reports , private letters , and government proclamations .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
On January 18th , Premier Vincent Siew returned home from Central America . Besides fulfilling his trip 's main purpose of cementing international friendships , Premier Siew also observed the results of using investment and trade as the central plank of a pragmatic foreign policy , and resolutely pushed for private enterprises to participate in popular diplomacy .  
In recent years there have been a number of cases of foreign circuses on tour in Taiwan experiencing cash crises which led to animals being abandoned and left cold and hungry . The spring chicken chases held in some localities , in which the fowl are sent scurrying in all directions as people try to grab them , have also attracted accusations of animal abuse .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
There has also been criticism voiced over the decision-making process . Wei Yung , director of a public policy think tank , contends that the president has neither constitutional nor legal authority to make foreign policy decisions or conduct diplomatic operations . Also , the meeting at which the decision was reached was not a meeting of the National Security Council nor of the Cabinet , so it is uncertain how binding this decision is .  
He emphasized that since its independence , PNG has been under foreign influence , but its people remain poor , lacking in education and basic infrastructure . Thus PNG needs to enter into international cooperative relationships . Taiwan , as an industrialized country with a high GDP , could provide practical help to PNG .  
The possibility that the political situation and foreign policy of another country can be completely overturned in half a month makes the job of the ROC Foreign Ministry in seeking formal ties abroad that much more difficult . It also creates more public opinion pressure on the government .  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
With regard to foreign aid , he said that helping diplomatic partners is Taiwan 's right and also its duty . Though these countries are not rich or powerful , " you ca n't measure everything by the same yardstick . " Though the economies of some diplomatic partners are too weak , and their democracies are immature , Taiwan must be willing to share its experience , in which economic takeoff spurred political democratization , and work together with diplomatic partner states to " stand up and move on out . "  
The MOEA promotes economic diplomacy in coordination with overall foreign policy . Concrete measures include the following : Based on the " Guidelines for Strengthening Economic and Trade Ties with Diplomatic Partner States in Latin America , " businesses are assisted in accessing agricultural or industrial raw materials , cheap labor , or land in Latin America , and are assisted in creating an international division of labor with Latin America and in penetrating North and South American markets .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
The case has elicited the concern of human rights groups around the world . The London headquarters of Amnesty International , which describes the convictions as " the judicial ruling of an uncivilized nation , " has organized several support campaigns for the three men , and last May sent representatives to Taiwan , where they called a press conference and stated , " If Taiwan 's government intends to make human rights a trump card of its foreign policy , it should first grant clemency to the Hsichih trio . "  
For example , Chang Ta-chun rejects the idea that My Kid Sister and Wild Child are representative of his oeuvre . These were selected for translation mainly because the themes were more comprehensible to a foreign audience . " My other works , " he explains , " are about events or are set against backdrops peculiar to China or Taiwan , and would n't be easy to translate , much less be accessible to most American readers . "  
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January . Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .  
When Sun wore a long jacket while shooting a music video , people could tell how excited she was at wearing a winter coat for the first time . At that moment , Taiwan did n't seem to be that far from Singapore , despite the latter 's endless summer weather . We all could sense a young woman 's joy at being accepted in foreign land that seemed at once familiar and exotic .  
The story is much the same when it comes to birds . Surveys of foreign starlings and mynas , also by TESRI , identified 13 non-native members of the family Sturnidae living wild in Taiwan , mainly escaped or released pets and their offspring . " White-vented mynas and common mynas have been recorded in over a third of Taiwan 's 361 urban townships , rural townships and city districts , " says a survey report by Lin Ruey-shing of TESRI .  
The growing importance attached to the practical application of college courses has also spread to colleges of foreign languages and natural science , where academic research has traditionally been a priority . This is particularly the case among technical colleges and universities that have been upgraded or newly established during the past decade , where the word " applied " appears in the title of virtually every course and where the teaching approach differs from that of the more traditional universities .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
The appeal of a divine being that loves all mankind did n't find a ready audience in Chinese who still had their original brush with the West-looking down the barrel of a gun-fresh in their memories ; people were suspicous of the relationship between Christian doctrine and economic interests ; and they got life-saving medicine side-by-side with life-destroying opium . People were not well educated and standards of living were low , so there was fear and prejudice against foreign culture .  
At the thirteenth APEC forum , which aligned itself with the global response against terror , we saw PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan set a dismal example when at a ministerial press conference before the final leaders ' summit he berated Taiwanese reporters and treated Taiwan 's delegates with great discourtesy . His behavior not only made a mockery of the summit 's primary theme of opposition to terrorism , violence and hatred , but also starkly reminded Taiwan 's people how far cross-strait relations still have to go .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
( Chang Chin-ju / tr . by Robert Taylor ) The APEC economic leaders ' meeting was concluded on 21 October . Regrettably , because Taiwan and this year 's host , mainland China , were unable to agree on Taiwan 's choice of representative , and because at a ministerial press conference prior to the leaders ' meeting PRC foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan prevented ROC economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi from speaking , the ROC government decided to withdraw from the summit .  
Peter Kurz , CEO of the investment consulting firm Insight Pacific , observes that although Taiwan 's non-performing loan ratio is increasing , the amount for dishonored checks and bills has not correspondingly risen . " This indicates , " he explains " that the rise in the non-performance ratio is a result of the government 's increasingly strict oversight of the financial sector , and the increasing transparency of bank operations , which in fact are positive things from the point of view of foreign investors . "  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
The reason Anatomy of a Public Servant has been well received is that the author is perceptive and attentive to the smallest details , has clearly read widely , and is well acquainted with sayings , literary sketches , and anecdotes of renowned Chinese and foreign personalities . He handles his materials skillfully and provides his readers with highly informative footnotes written with a light touch .  
But social work postgraduate student Chen Chin-jung , who is writing her master 's dissertation about foreign brides , maintains that its more an exchange than a purchase . In her view both the Taiwanese bridegrooms and their foreign brides are seeking in the other an opportunity to fulfill a need of their own . The men want the opportunity to marry and start a family , while the women are seizing a chance to improve their standard of living and to better themselves . This makes each of them the best choice in the other 's eyes .  
Moreover , the residents of Tannan village have always supported themselves through farming and manual labor , but the nation 's current economic lull coupled with the presence of foreign labor has caused unemployment rates to increase steadily . The consequences of Typhoon Toraji last year , erosion , and the loss of arable land , have deepened the region 's economic turmoil , further impairing the prospects of reconstruction . At present , only five or six houses are under construction .  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
It was quite a story at the time . This 16-year-old Brazilian youth had already , at the age of 14 , won first prize on a Brazilian television quiz show , startling everybody with his rich knowledge of China . As a result , the ROC ambassador to Brazil , T.T . Li , noticed him , and eventually he was invited to visit the ROC by then-minister of education Chang Chi-yun and vice foreign minister Shen Chuang-huan . This event planted the seeds of a lifelong love for Chinese culture and for Taiwan .  
In contrast to its fellow " Little Dragons , " Taiwan 's economic policy has been waffling since 1997 . With so much still up in the air , foreign investors have been unwilling to put their money into Taiwan and local businesspeople have begun losing patience with the government 's dithering . Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of Taiwan 's economic outlook is that government and industry are headed in opposite directions and the distance between them is growing .  
When the ROC 's Immigration Law was promulgated in 1999 , it offered foreign nationals the right of permanent residency for the first time . But the conditions were that at the time of applying , a foreigner had to have accumulated " seven years of continuous lawful residency , " during which time they had to have been in Taiwan for at least 270 days each year . In other words , an applicant could not have left Taiwan for more than three months in any of the previous seven years .  
The amendments also relax the rules for granting permanent residency to the foreign spouses and children of Taiwan-resident ROC citizens . The basic requirement of five years ' continuous residency is unchanged , but the alternative requirement of being resident in Taiwan for 183 days in eight of the last 15 years is reduced to 183 days in five of the last ten years .  
The Ministry of the Interior 's issuance of permanent residency certificates to religious and medical personnel such as Bjarne Gislefoss is a courtesy extended in recognition of the Taiwanese public 's gratitude to them , for they have long since made Taiwan their second homeland . The relaxation of the conditions for permanent residency for long-term foreign residents is based on humanitarian considerations , and may make them more willing to choose to " keep their roots in Taiwan . "  
First we divided them by country , and the initial selection was carried out by experts speaking those languages , " says Lorna Kung . " The poems were translated into Chinese and the final selection was made by well known Taiwan-based poets such as Chang Hsiang-hua , Yang Tu and Chung Chiao . The judges were surprised by the level of writing by the foreign workers , finding many of the poems to be quite moving , " she adds .  
In Asia , the main reason for inadequate production of staple foods ( most importantly rice ) was backward farming techniques and insufficient fertilizers . Because of this , in 1968 the Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) , a regional forum of foreign ministers , began to discuss solutions , and decided to set up the FFTC .  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights .

Under the WTO regime , Japan again lost in arbitration over complaints brought by foreign countries . WTO rulings are more enforceable , so within 15 months of the ruling Japan raised taxes on sake and somewhat lowered tariffs on imports of hard liquor . Nonetheless , by hemming and hawing , Japan put off raising taxes on sake for more than a decade .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
In recent years , annual reports published by American and European business associations based in Taipei have focused on the key question of opening the " three links , " shorthand for resuming normal trade , transportation , and mail routes with mainland China , and other cross-strait economic and trade policy . In fact , this issue has caused a number of foreign manufacturers to close their operations in Taiwan and to relocate to mainland China .  
Wufeng is the leading producer of these in Taiwan , with more than 40 growers cultivating a large range of varieties including the enoki ( or enokitake ) , of which Wufeng is one of the world 's leading sources . The ROC government has been encouraging the growing of edible mushrooms since as far back as the immediate post-WWII period . Wufeng has played a leading role in the development of mushrooms as an economic crop in Taiwan , and has earned a considerable amount of foreign exchange in the process .  
She confidently points out that her own English pronunciation is accurate , and she is capable of leading classroom activities , knows how to prepare a curriculum , and understands the background of local students . On the other hand , " foreign teachers are n't necessarily superior instructors because they do n't have experience teaching Taiwanese students , and they are n't as sensitive to the kinds of linguistic difficulties that Taiwanese students encounter , " Lu says .  
In addition to private entrepreneurs abandoning their hide-bound attitudes and moving forward hand in hand to develop the market , the Executive Yuan 's plan to double the number of foreign tourists was already on track last year with an estimated investment over the next six years of almost NT $ 80 billion and a yearly target for visitors to Taiwan in 2003 and beyond of three million , up from 2.6 million of previous years .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
" There are some battered foreign brides who loathe Taiwanese and think all Taiwanese are evil , and even distrust the social workers themselves , " says Vietnamese-born Sister Mei of the Good Shepherd Sisters . Current law stipulates that even foreign brides who have legal residence must return home if they get divorced , without the possibility of taking their children with them . This last point is very difficult to bear and they frequently feel the social workers are unwilling to help them .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
In her first and second years in university she tried to transfer to the department of foreign languages . In her senior year she began taking courses at a supplementary school to prepare for the exam to enter graduate school to study foreign relations .

He says that at present , unclear policies and sporadic services result in serious problems such foreign wives failing to adjust well to their surroundings , domestic violence , children doing poorly in school , and bogus marriages that are actually a cover for prostitution . According to Lin , the government urgently needs to address the growing social problems and costs arising from transnational marriages .  
If the curse of the hardy , abundant , and inexpensive tilapia in the domestic market is its " poor man 's fish " image , the greatest obstacle to foreign sales is the intractable problem of drug residues . This is especially true for the EU market , with its stricter testing standards .  
Hungary is a small nation that al-ways held itself aloof from the rest of the world , but was also plagued by countless calamities , and was time and again " liberated " by foreign nations . After the great catastrophe of the Tatar ( Mongol ) invasion , Hungary enjoyed several centuries of peace and growth . In the 16th century , the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary , and occupied it for 150 years . The Turks left a historical legacy of Turkish baths and Byzantine architecture , which remain to this day . . . .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .  
Victor Chang sums it up this way : " In the past , Taiwan 's real estate market was ailing , so , just as an ill person takes medicine , a restorative tonic was applied , consisting of preferential home loans , halved land value increment tax , and foreign investment . Close examination should reveal whether the market has improved as a result of the treatment . "  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe .

The economic crises in the developing world have been greatly aggravated : unemployment and economic stagnation have been compounded by persisting problems in international trade , by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials .  
Most of them are facing the challenges of globalization with economies made uniquely vulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness , their precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable international economic environment .  
The international community 's commitment to sustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced by encouraging increased direct foreign investment , as well as an increased international transfer of financial resources to the region .  
The presence of foreign troops within the territories of sovereign States , in the name of protecting the social , cultural , ethnic , linguistic or religious rights of minorities , can not justify any effort to promote human rights .  
The Committee further reaffirmed that the activities of foreign economic , financial and other interests operating at present in the colonial Territories constituted a major obstacle to political independence and racial equality .  
However , the continent must be the beneficiary of , inter alia , a major reduction in its debt burden , the elimination of obstacles to its exports , vigorous foreign investments and increasing international assistance better adapted to national policies .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
A number of delegations addressed the issue of the continued growth of foreign direct investment in the world economy in the context of expected recovery in world economic performance and growth and continuing structural changes in the world economy .  
To the extent that foreign direct investment frameworks became similar , other factors assumed great significance ; these included appropriate legal framework good governance , and a stable political and sound macroeconomic environment .  
The attractiveness of Africa as a location for foreign direct investment continued to be constrained by the small size of most markets , weak private sectors , poor physical infrastructure , an uneven skill level and the heavy reliance on primary exports .  
In developing the mineral sector and increasing its attractiveness to foreign investors , information regarding all laws , regulations , mineral potential , support services , the ability of the skilled workforce , and key government contacts is essential .

Along with reform in all aspects of social life , Viet Nam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broad openness , the thrust of which is to diversify and multilateralize its external relations in order to create a stable environment and external conditions conducive to the task of building and defending the country , and to enhance Viet Nam 's position on the international scene .  
The achievements of its foreign policy provide a new impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process of regional and global integration , and to participate more effectively in global forums and institutions , with a view to tackling the pressing problems facing all mankind , and to contributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of the international community to achieve peace , national independence , friendship , cooperation among States and development .  
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .

The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
However , despite these endeavours and despite my Government 's resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for our people on a firm foundation , foreign interests , for their own unavowed purposes , want to see the democratic process in my country shaped as the saying is in the image and likeness of those alien interests .  
In 1992 the Cuban Parliament approved a constitutional amendment which modified existing laws in respect of the Cuban State 's acknowledgement of property rights , the rights of joint ventures , and economic associations with foreign capital investments .  
The arrogant approach and attitude of the Government of the United States of America towards the international community , and the unsuccessful attempts of the American foreign policy establishment to exploit issues of global concern , such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , to advance an extraneous and illegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed dangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral measures .  
But it is clearly a temporary stimulant that must be tied to gradually increasing efficiency in our ability to build our economic institutions , our taxation and customs systems , to utilize our natural resources in reconstructing our economic infrastructure , and to encourage Palestinian and foreign capital investment in our economy so that we may be able to build an open and strong economy . 
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
The difficulties besetting African countries are still present : the crushing burden of external debt , the steady deterioration of the terms of trade , the scant inflow of resources and direct foreign investment and the continued degradation of the environment because of the growing , interrelated pressures of the population and poverty .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
Indeed , since 1990 official development assistance for Africa has continued to decline , and direct foreign investment remains weak in a very difficult international situation characterized by fierce trade competition , which the Uruguay Round agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries . 
In the case of foreign military installations , we did hear some comments to the effect that the military installations were an important factor in local employment and the local economic situation , and that because of the decision to close or downsize some of them there were adverse consequences that some of the Territories were unable to face without adequate cooperation from the administering Powers . 
One of those beautiful pages was written when , on the heels of an intensive campaign of work done by all sectors throughout our society , with the support of the international community and led mainly by this Committee , the then United States President , Jimmy Carter , granted an unconditional pardon to our national heroes who were then still jailed in the United States for their action against foreign dominion .  
As members know , the working papers prepared by the Secretariat inform us that the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are developing successfully and thus moving towards self-determination only where there has been the active involvement of foreign economic entities through substantial foreign investment .  
We see nothing controversial about requesting the administering Powers not to violate the Charter by exploiting the natural resources of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories or in any way subordinating their rights and interests to foreign economic and financial interests .  Is it really wrong to urge these Powers to ensure that acceptable working conditions prevail in these Territories ?

In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .

This genocide , which was perpetrated with the support of foreign pro-imperialist forces , was an exceptionally brutal part of a deliberate plan of aggression pursued by the Armenian aggressors against the independent Azerbaijani State ; it was an unprecedented act of vandalism and has been recorded in the history of the twentieth century as a crime against all humanity .  
Reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence , territorial integrity , national unity and for liberation from colonial and foreign domination , and for the establishment of a society in which people , irrespective of race , colour or creed , will fully enjoy economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights on a basis of equality and participate freely in the determination of their destiny ,

Established in 1988 , the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency ( MIGA ) promotes foreign direct investment for economic and social development in borrowing member countries by guaranteeing investments against political risks , helping countries to create an attractive investment climate and providing promotional and advisory services .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .

It was considered that good governance , including accountability and transparency , a sound and stable macroeconomic policy framework , consistent and effective policies for reform and structural adjustment , taking into account the social dimension , creation of favourable conditions for market-oriented development and foreign direct investment were equally critical to success ;  
Governments designed and directed credit programmes , controlled interest rates , limited the access of its citizens to foreign currencies , restricted the access of foreigners and maintained fixed exchange rates .  
The structural reforms undertaken in the banking sector centred on privatizing State-owned banks , reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and foreign private banks , liberalizing the types of activities that banks could undertake and , concomitantly , improving the prudential regulation of financial institutions .

In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
Seminars and workshops on the functions and impact of international , regional and bilateral arrangements ; country experience studies ; harmonization of foreign direct investment reporting systems ; incorporation of sustainable development management practices into national policies ; and enhancement of national strategies for sustainable development as they relate to transnational corporations .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
A prior requirement , however , would be the removal by individual countries of the range of impediments that currently limit intraregional capital flows , including foreign-exchange controls , legislation and regulations , that discriminate against foreign investors , restrictions on transfers and other direct and indirect measures designed to influence capital flows .  
Despite an almost total information blockade and the restriction of the movement of representatives of international organizations by the Croatian side under various pretexts , foreign media have managed to inform the world public about some of the atrocities and the systematic drive of the Croatian military and civilian authorities to erase the traces of these atrocities by burning the dead , burying them in unmarked mass graves or by washing the streets and roads to remove the evidence .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
It urges genuine cooperation among all States in the framework of international legitimacy so that the necessary measures may be taken to prevent and combat terrorism and eliminate its causes , and it calls for the formulation of internationally acceptable criteria to differentiate clearly between terrorism , which must be condemned and opposed , and national struggle against foreign occupation , which must be protected and supported .  
Undertakes studies on the level of national savings , development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

While approaches to reform vary widely across countries at different stages of development , the group 's work in the area of improving the business environment covers four areas : reducing barriers to competition and streamlining regulation , strengthening legal and judicial systems , supporting entrepreneurial development and promoting global integration through foreign direct investment and expansion of trade .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .  
Capital has become more mobile than ever across the world , owing to a combination of policies that encourage foreign investment in many developing economies with the rapid advance in computer-based telecommunication technology ; and the growth in the size of institutional investors ( mutual funds , pension funds , and so on ) .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
If differences among countries ' living standards are the focus of the comparison , then a purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate is regarded as the most appropriate method , as it values the commodities and services sold in each country at a set of common international prices , rather than at local prices multiplied by the value of the national currency determined in the foreign exchange market .  
Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced , wars of aggression , armed conflicts , colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation , civil wars , terrorism and [ extremist violence ] continue to plague many parts of the world .  
They range from alleged threats to the national security of the sender State and the alleged violation of agreed international norms and instruments by the target State , to expressions of dislike for specific domestic or foreign policies of the target State or more generally for the political and socio-economic system of the target State .  
According to the calculations made by advocates of this policy , it would cause such a serious deterioration in the standards of living of the population that spontaneous public demonstrations of popular discontent would occur , bringing to an end the social revolutionary process begun 36 years ago , and thereby fulfilling the main objective of the foreign policy towards Cuba of the last nine United States administrations .  
Alongside this discrimination in hiring , in some countries there are legislative and regulatory provisions prohibiting foreigners from engaging in certain occupations or limiting their number , reflecting in some cases the fear of foreign influence in areas supposed to be sensitive but more often a desire to protect the economic activity of nationals against foreign competition , or , in other words , protectionist concerns .  
Securing the potential benefits of globalization by enhancing competitiveness through promoting price stability ( low inflation ) ; avoiding artificial distortions to the prices of domestic resources ( land , labour , capital ) ; reducing trade taxes and import duties , which adversely affect export competitiveness ; and removing implicit and explicit barriers to foreign direct investment ;

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
NULLThe Working Group also concluded that foreign direct investment was attracted most strongly to those countries that had adopted measures to strengthen their domestic technological capability and created an overall policy framework conducive to innovation , investment in infrastructure , intellectual property protection , human capital formation and a stable macroeconomic and regulatory environment .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
It should give participants access to a comprehensive subject knowledge of international political relations , intergovernmental institutions , international law enforcement , multilateral diplomacy , foreign policy and practical diplomatic skills .  
They receive the label " untrustworthy " , which effectively bars them from engaging in professional or technical work and blocks their access to administrative posts or positions of responsibility or employment in a foreign firm , even though their qualifications and skills may make them ideal candidates for the job .  
Cuba is not immune to the ideological effect of institutions such as self-employment , the agricultural and livestock market and , on another scale , foreign enterprises , with the concomitant national and foreign businessmen connected with the mixed import and export economy .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
The tangible benefits of this work were : increased quality production of salt ; enhanced income generation for rural women ; training and better information through the provision of simple technology ; and the use of solar evaporation methods leading to less deforestation and saving of foreign exchange when salt did not need to be imported .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Within the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , the remote sensing program of the Foreign Agricultural Service ( FAS ) continued to be a critical element in the analysis of domestic and foreign agricultural production , supply , and demand - - providing timely , accurate , and unbiased estimates of global area , yield , and production .  
The estimated measurable loss on the basis of the unrealized social product , as well as of the unrealized net inflow of invisible transactions with foreign countries , and on the basis of the additional costs of the increased number of unemployed persons and refugees is US $ 147.3-billion for the entire 1991-2011 period - US $ 45.1-billion for the period 1991-1994 and US $ 102.2-billion for the period 1995-2011 . 
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Three legal experts have worked with the Ministry of Justice and , in cooperation with the Ministry and UNDP , the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda developed a plan to deploy 50 foreign legal experts to assist the Government in restarting all the essential functions of the judicial system , which presently suffers from an acute shortage of qualified local personnel .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
In the case of the United States government employee assigned or posted to a foreign area , the base pay is augmented by living quarters allowance , post allowance , post differential , danger pay , and other allowances , as applicable .  
By the middle of 1990 , the First Group , with continued foreign assistance , had developed designs and had fabricated and tested a small series of prototype centrifuge machines incorporating carbon fibre rotors and magnetic bearings , the final version of which had a demonstrated capacity of the order of 2 kg separative work units ( SWU ) per year .  
the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ;  
concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports .

that , as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , [ 25 ] / held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration , and that remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind ,  
of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
In accordance with the fundamental principle that the least developed countries are primarily responsible for formulating and implementing growth and development policies , the Government of Myanmar had introduced far-reaching economic reforms , replacing the centrally planned socialist system with a market-oriented economic system , and a series of follow-up economic measures including reversal of price controls and subsidies , liberalization of domestic and foreign trade , reduction in the general level of taxation and opening up of border trade with neighbouring countries . 
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements on those Territories .

To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it . 
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
In August 1985 , a major shift took place in our economic policy that included , among other measures , a reform and simplification of the taxation system , a drastic reduction in the fiscal deficit , price deregulation , a reordering of the public enterprise sector and a greater openness to private investment , both foreign and domestic .  
It also involves injecting new capital from the private sector , either domestic or foreign , into national public enterprises through an innovative , efficient capitalization and administration plan , in collaboration with strategic private partners .  
The State was typical of the nineteenth century : a judge and gendarme liberal State assuming the essential duties of national defence , internal security , foreign relations , basic financial activity and justice .  
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
On the other hand , the Government was faced with crippling obstacles , in the form of a treasury that had been emptied and swept clean by the ousted regime ; the threat from regrouped elements of the defeated army of the former regime ; a completely decimated public service ; and interference by hostile foreign Governments associated with the defeated former regime .  
Though a service designed for a different society and limited to the specific areas assigned by the colonial administration , Malta 's public service gave its contribution to the development of the new State by providing continuity in certain vital domestic sectors and in the setting up of new services , including that of foreign affairs .  
They include the elimination of automatic direct access to the civil service for all of those leaving training institutions ; the opening up of training institutions to the private sector , as well as to foreign students , especially those from the subregion , provided they pay for their training ; revision of the institutions ' current rules to permit them to generate their own resources and to allow for self-management ; and revitalizing the work of improving the various institutions , work in which the potential users will be able to participate .  
It is astonishing to note that the Government and people of Lebanon , who are fighting to liberate their territory from prolonged foreign occupation an inherent and inalienable right recognized by international law and enshrined in the United Nations Charter are called upon to give up their right to self-defence and hence submit to aggression , occupation , and non-compliance with Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
We are still concerned about the ongoing , complex and uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for an unconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops from the Transdniester region .  
These figures , combined with a liberal investment law and a low gross domestic product of $ 287 per capita , are providing strong incentives for foreign direct investment , in particular now that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with the United States , the European Union and other important countries in the world .  
We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints faced by various developed countries , clarification of foreign aid objectives , revised conditions governing the granting of assistance , and the heightened competition among various regions for aid packages constitute a serious challenge for developing countries such as mine .  
A world free of colonialism , foreign occupation and aggression , and protected from the threat of racial hegemony , expansionism or colonization is the necessary precursor of a world free of poverty , injustice and oppression , in which relations are more democratic , humane , secure and stable for the well-being of one and all .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
On the one hand , Israel 's nuclear-weapons programme has continuously received the direct and indirect political and technical support of one State ; on the other , the interventionist policy of coercive deprivation of other countries in the same region of their inalienable right to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the very same State .  
The definitive solution to the problem of the external debt , of ownership and of a considerable improvement in national , foreign and private investment , in the framework of a sound and responsible macroeconomic policy favouring internal savings and contributing to improving the standard of living of the Nicaraguan people , must be our goal .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
It faces daunting problems , including civil strife , a large foreign debt , increasing populations dependent on decreasing amounts of usable land , and an inadequate flow of investment .  
Among other things , African countries had experienced considerable difficulties in attracting the requisite foreign direct investment , and had also been unable to ensure adequate access of their populations to education , health and related social services .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
It is imperative for the African countries to continue to obtain a significant amount of external support , especially in the form of official development assistance , in order to be able to create the national enabling environment and establish the necessary conditions to attract foreign investment and create a productive base that will allow them to participate and compete effectively in the international market place .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
The objectives of the Community , as defined in the Treaty of Chaguaramas inter alia , economic cooperation through the Caribbean Common Market ; coordinated foreign policies ; and creating joint services in such essential sectors as health , education , culture , communications and industrial relations have been methodically pursued through the establishment of appropriate Community structures by its member States . 
The Helms-Burton Act also calls for an annual report that would describe all bilateral assistance provided to Cuba by other countries , including humanitarian assistance ; Cuban debt to third countries , as well as the amount exchanged , forgiven or reduced ; identification of Cuban trading partners ; and a description of the joint ventures completed or under consideration by foreign nationals and business firms .  
For example , even though calls for the promotion of the private sector , increased industrial development and foreign direct investment , and the reduction of external debt in African countries are regularly made in various forums , harsh marketplace reality shows that portfolio equity investment remains virtually absent , and that less than 5 per cent of global foreign direct investment is targeted to African countries .  
It should improve the level , scope and modalities of official development assistance ; extend and enlarge trade concessions and preferences to African countries , particularly the least developed countries ; take additional and decisive measures to alleviate Africa 's external debt burden ; encourage and facilitate foreign direct investments ; and further coordinate multi-donor assistance in accordance with Africa 's development priorities .  
Almost five years ago , on 1 December 1991 , in a national referendum , the people of Ukraine confirmed its sovereign will and determination to build its own independent State with a predictable domestic and foreign policy to integrate our nation into the European family of free democracies .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
At their annual meetings in 1996 , foreign ministers both of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 called for the immediate elimination of all forms of coercive economic measures with negative , extraterritorial impact on the development of developing countries and which undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law and the free flow of trade and investment .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
As a representative of Poland , a country that has suffered so much war , foreign occupation and partition in its history of more than 1,000 years , I feel entitled to convey a simple message : peace is priceless , be it international , with other countries , or internal , among social partners . 
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
Drought or inadequate supplies of water in southern and northern parts of the continent reduced agricultural output and increased the diversion of foreign exchange earnings for food imports in several countries in 1995 .  
We also welcome the remarkable work carried out every day , frequently in dangerous conditions on the ground , by local and foreign humanitarian organizations and the various programmes , United Nations organs and international institutions to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population and to aid in the rebuilding of the country .  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of drought followed by excessive rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
He has published several books and numerous articles on the law of nationality , private international law , in the strict sense , and international civil procedural law in Venezuelan and foreign journals .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Whatever their geographical scope , however , issues such as depletion of natural resources , declining food production , and declining availability and quality of water were linked with issues such as income generation , literacy , health care , unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the developed world , privatization and the effects of structural adjustment programmes , international trade patterns , and the foreign debt burden .  
In his latest report , the Secretary-General informed the Security Council , inter alia , that , subsequent to the visits by a number of foreign dignitaries and the adoption of Council resolution 1045 ( 1996 ) , there had been positive developments during February 1996 , including a decrease in the number of cease-fire violations , a further reduction in hostile propaganda , the release of additional prisoners , the disengagement of government forces from some forward positions and the continued quartering of the rapid reaction police in 3 of the 10 planned quartering areas .  
The aim is clear : it is to punish Cuba for seeking tenaciously to determine freely , sovereignly and independently its own political , economic and social organization ; for securing for its people a future of justice , free from foreign interference and petty interests such as those which , for more than 60 years , controlled the country under the protection of United States .  
These were cases in which an official received a gift from a representative of a foreign Government on the occasion of an official visit to the country concerned , if he or she received a gift from a community organization on a social occasion where the gift represented the work or an achievement of that organization ; or if he or she received a gift from other officers in the service on the occasion of his or her marriage , retirement , transfer or other celebratory occasion , if the present was approved by the Commissioner .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
Rather than the initial very simple structure of a pure equity investment by an individual foreign investor where risk was self insured , a number of joint venture investments have concluded and have been structured to include a mix of equity and non-recourse project debt , with insurance provided by either private or agency insurers .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
In less mature situations , where the supportive social and economic infrastructure is not as advanced , some foreign companies are working at the community level to provide direct social and economic support that should become self-sustaining .  
The legal and fiscal frameworks should provide assured access to land for exploration , clear and transparent rules and procedures , security of tenure from exploration through production , a stable and equitable fiscal regime , equal opportunity to foreign investors and access to international arbitration .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Those amendments also introduced a requirement for banks and special financial institutions to report to the competent authorities all transfers abroad of Turkish lira and foreign currency exceeding US $ 50,000 or its equivalent , except in the case of exports , imports and invisible transactions .  
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
In contrast to this median situation , at one extreme were countries with fast-growing domestic demand and good access to foreign currency , which expanded both their output and their external purchases , or countries which experienced real appreciation of their currencies . 
The policies announced by the Government included a halt to the printing of money , a reduction in the excessive amounts of money in circulation , increases in the charges on government-provided goods and services , the sale of some government assets , and a relaxation of the restrictions on foreign exchange trading by allowing official exchange houses to trade at rates comparable with those available on the parallel market , as well as by allowing Iraqis living abroad to transfer funds to their relatives in Iraq .  
To increase Governments ' understanding of the main internal and external problems and obstacles impeding the development of foreign trade and foreign direct investments in the ECE region and the implications for these areas of implementing the Uruguay Round decisions by the beginning of the twenty-first century with a view to contributing to the adoption of policies facilitating and promoting intraregional trade and investment cooperation ;  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
He also stressed that the establishment of an independent economy and sustainable economic development would necessarily require a diversified production base , free trade relations with Israel and the transformation from dependency on exporting the labour force to production and exports to foreign markets .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
According to both foreign observers and residents , the leading causes of continuing lawlessness in the region are the lack of an adequate professional police presence and the Croatian authorities ' unwillingness to take firm preventive action against human rights violators .  
Other countries like Benin , Ethiopia and Senegal , which experienced a severe decline in foreign direct investment during the previous decade , have managed to arrest and even reverse this trend as a result of reforms and with the advent of an encouraging economic outlook .  
Measures to enhance socio-political stability and good governance and to secure sound macroeconomic policies that will be conducive to private foreign and domestic investment should be strongly encouraged .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
The Governments of countries in transition have also made considerable progress in integrating their economies into the global market economy : most of their foreign trade is now conducted with developed market economies at international prices and in convertible currencies , and their international links have been further strengthened by inflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
In 1994 , the Special Committee , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .  
Complications involved in organizing the arrival and departure of foreign technical assistance experts and equipment and of Libyan experts being sent abroad on official mission or for study or training , entailing the extra cost of using overland or sea transport to visit friendly and neighbouring countries , combined with the additional fatigue resulting from these trips which may have the psychological effect of dissuading these experts from continuing to make their precious contribution and providing their vast theoretical and practical knowledge to help improve efficiency in the various areas of scientific and technical cooperation ;  
They are based on the concept of direct ( impact on the balance of payments ) , indirect and additional losses and include the methods of evaluating losses declared by Bulgarian economic entities , of analysis and simulation of foreign trade with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the country 's balance of payments ( trade in goods and services ) as well as the method of expert analysis by line ministries .  
The experience he has acquired over eight years prompts the Special Rapporteur to assert that situations involving , for example , armed conflict , terrorism , or violence linked to extremist intolerance foster a growing reliance on the use of mercenaries , which for our purposes means seeking out foreign experts who are paid for services of destructive violence and deadly effectiveness .  
Any State that expropriates , nationalizes or takes measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization of property owned by foreign nationals must respect the following rules : such action must be for a public purpose , non-discriminatory , and accompanied by prompt , adequate and effective compensation , granting to the expropriated party effective administrative or judicial review of the measure and quantum of compensation .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
Contributing to this improvement were the slight deceleration of inflation ( as of July 1996 , 17.6 per cent on an annual basis ) ; increase in available foreign exchange owing to a growing number of visitors , both Haitians living abroad and foreigners ; and strengthening of the gourde resulting from the inflow of foreign currency by bilateral or multilateral donors to finance public investments .  
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
At the governmental level , the exercise of power in what were certainly crucial moments for the future of the country was gathered in the hands of the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the Minister of Defence and the National Security Council , while the other ministers in the Government were barely kept informed of Burundi 's request for foreign security assistance made at the 25 June Arusha Summit and supported by the Yaound Summit a dozen or so days later . 
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
Ensure that pupils learn a foreign language to a sufficient level to enable them to have direct access to works of universal thought , technical works , scientific theories and human values , and train them to follow developments in these areas and to contribute to them in such a way as to enrich the national culture and its interaction with the universal human culture ;  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated the continued validity of the fundamental right of all peoples to self-determination , the exercise of which , in the case of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation , is essential to ensure the eradication of all those situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State in which proceeding the asset and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court or other competent authority , for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation [ provided that the debts were not incurred predominantly for household or other personal rather than commercial purposes ] ;  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
With regard to the requirement for a certified copy of the decision opening the foreign proceeding , the concern was expressed that the use of such an expression might exclude those cases in which the foreign representative was appointed , or the proceedings were commenced , without an actual decision or order of the court ( e.g . , by right pursuant to statutory authority , such as in a debtor-initiated voluntary proceeding ) .  
In response it was observed that , while the spirit of article 12 required expeditious consideration by the court of the enacting State of the application for recognition of the foreign proceedings , the question raised was not suitable for being addressed within the limited scope of the Model Provisions and should be left for the laws of the enacting State .  
While agreeing with the principle that a foreign representative should be given the right to commence actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to creditors ( sometimes referred to as Paulian actions ) , the Working Group considered that it would be preferable to delete the reference to them in subparagraph ( b ) ( v ) .  
Employers found guilty of abusing domestic workers were liable to heavy sentences , including jail terms and corporal punishment , and were permanently barred from employing foreign domestic workers in the future .  
There are still many countries in desperate economic circumstances , with high levels of external debt , minimal foreign investment , low levels of savings , poor terms of trade , adverse balances of payments and minimal participation in the global economy .  
Mr . BAALI ( Algeria ) said that the origin of the dramatic events currently taking place in the world lay , even more than in colonialism and the disintegration of communism , in the resurgence of violence provoked by the exacerbation of nationalistic , ethnic , religious and tribal sentiments and fed by foreign intervention . 
Mr . ARDA ( Turkey ) said that modern Turkey had been established following a struggle against foreign occupation and domination , and therefore attached great importance to the right to self-determination ; however , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , that must not be understood as authorizing or encouraging attempts aimed at the partial or total disruption of the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States with democratically elected Governments and parliaments representing the whole population . 
In her country 's view , the right to self-determination meant the right of peoples to free themselves from colonialist oppression or foreign occupation , in accordance with the position stated by the Organization of African Unity that the colonial borders of African States should be left unaltered to avoid the risks of disintegration of the States concerned , the encouragement of insurrection and the disruption of international peace and security . 
What is particularly lacking in terms of raising domestic competition and increasing the competitiveness of economies in transition is a sufficient number of privately owned medium-sized enterprises capable of growing and competing not only in domestic markets but also in foreign markets .  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Under that decree , a committee chaired by the prefect , and composed of men of religion and eminent Greek Muslim citizens , is responsible for proposing to the Minister of Education and Worship a list of qualified persons ( who must , in particular , be holders of a university degree from a school of advanced Islamic studies , whether Greek or foreign , or persons who have performed functions as an imam for at least 10 years and who have distinguished themselves by their morality and theological competence ) .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
Deeply concerned at the fact that the recent natural disasters that have occurred in Nicaragua , the burden of the foreign debt , despite its reduction and renegotiation achieved with the collaboration of the international community , and the harmful effects on its economy of the prolonged periods of rain and floods that have afflicted the Central American region impede the efforts being made by Nicaragua to overcome the consequences of war within the framework of a democracy and under the macroeconomic conditions already achieved ,  
Training camps for foreign Muslim extremists , originally intended for the organization of violent actions outside the Sudan , were now being used , owing to the weakening of the State and to international pressure , for domestic repression alien to local Islamic traditions .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
On the other hand , the missile attached launched in retaliation by the United States in the southern region of the country causing substantial loss of life , an attack that had been condemned by the international community , constituted a violation of the inalienable right of the Kurdish people to express freely their will without foreign interference and was part of a deliberate campaign by the United States authorities aimed at bringing about the disintegration of the Iraqi State and undermining the national unity and territorial integrity of a sovereign State .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
Yet , foreign direct investment was urgently required in Africa and in the least developed countries for the rejuvenation of the industrial and agricultural sectors and for the effective implementation of structural adjustment programmes .  
He wondered why the United States Government used double standards , accusing some countries of human rights violations , while turning a blind eye to those committed by some of its allies and ignoring the thousands of political detainees and shielding the killing of unarmed women and children and the occupation of foreign territory as it made use of its veto .  
Thus the decisive impact of transport efficiency on countries ' competitiveness and their ability to attract foreign direct investment is obvious : since the annual cost of international maritime transport was estimated at US $ 250-billion in 1994 ( half of which being incurred in ports ) , a 5 per cent reduction in port and transport costs could save traders some US $ 12.5-billion per annum .  
The limited organizational capacity of many local transport providers - particularly undersized freight forwarders , who with proper assistance might develop into efficient multimodal transport operators - is leaving many countries too dependent on foreign transport providers . 
With regard to racial discrimination , his delegation naturally condemned racial violence , xenophobia and racism , but could not accept a failure to take account of the flagrant violations of the rights of peoples represented by colonialism , foreign occupation , genocide , ethnic cleansing , and the hatred voiced of Arabs , Africans , Asians and the peoples of Latin America , all issues which were not broached in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance . 
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
In the following days , shots were fired at the main police station of the capital , the Parliament and the National Television building and , on 20 August , two MDN leaders were assassinated .  The leaders of one opposition party alleged that the Government was involved , while the press quoted foreign officials who implicated the Presidential Security Unit .  
The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of this Declaration ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
His delegation supported in part the approach followed by the Commission in its previous sessions , namely , to retain only those crimes whose gravity could not easily be contested , as well as crimes of a clearly political nature which posed a threat to international peace and security and therefore to exclude crimes , such as piracy , trafficking in women and children , racial discrimination , recruitment of mercenaries and foreign intervention .  
The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan , which has become a basic strategic principle of its foreign policy , is the most acceptable approach for Turkmenistan in pursuing its national interests and is in keeping with the country 's historical , geopolitical and ethno-cultural realities .  
It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
According to article 31 , such law includes Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , in which the Security Council determined , acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , that Iraq is liable under international law for any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations , as a result of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
Reiterates grave concern about the excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , as well as the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
In the context of the discussion of article 14 , a proposal was made to include a new paragraph in article 14 providing that recognition of a foreign proceeding should be granted only to such limited effects as were consistent with the purposes of ensuring coordination of proceedings under the provisions ( yet to be formulated ) on coordination between a pending main proceeding in the enacting State and a subsequent application for recognition of a foreign main or non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
It was proposed that , within the context of article 15 ( 1 ) , the powers of the foreign representative or other person designated by the court should be limited to measures destined to preserve three categories of assets : perishable assets , assets susceptible of devaluation and assets otherwise in jeopardy , such as where there was an imminent danger of their being concealed or dissipated .  
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
It was noted , for example , that , if the courts applied their broad " domestic " notion of public policy to the recognition of foreign judicial decisions , very few foreign decisions would ever be recognized since most foreign proceedings would , in one or the other aspect , depart from procedures which , internally , constituted matters governed by imperative rules .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .  
In its foreign relations , Viet Nam will constantly pursue an open foreign policy of independence , diversification and the promotion of multilateral relations along the line of gradual regional and international integration , thus making worthy contributions to the cause of peace , national independence , democracy and social progress .  
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
In this context , the proper functioning of democratic institutions , the positive performance of a market economy and the conduct of an open and rational foreign policy are essential if the multifarious problems arising within our societies and among our States are to be successfully addressed .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
These are the facts about the bellicose , obstinate , rejectionist and intransigent attitude of the Taliban , which is aided and assisted by the presence of agents of the cross-border military intelligence services and attested to by the physical presence of foreign military and paramilitary prisoners in Afghanistan .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
It has the intention of continuing the dialogue initiated there on a number of bilateral issues , including trade , which is in perfect agreement with our foreign policy agenda , which will seek , after overcoming our internal armed confrontation , to pursue a better understanding and strengthening of our international relations , thus contributing to a better understanding among peoples , including a brighter future for China and Guatemala . I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council . 
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
According to article 2.2.2 , a voluntary organization means any foreign voluntary organization whose purpose is to carry out work the nature of which is social , scientific , educational , research based , cultural , technical or religious and which is registered under this Act .  
On the basis of all the information received and a detailed study of the documentation it appears that the situation of the Sikhs in the religious field is satisfactory , but that difficulties are arising in the political ( foreign interference , terrorism , etc . ) , economic ( in particular with regard to sharing of water supplies ) and even occupational fields .  
As regards Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab , the Special Rapporteur urges all the parties concerned _ official and non _ official , national and foreign _ to act calmly and refrain from exacerbating religious problems to ensure that immutable religious principles are not affected by political considerations at the expense of the religious rights of the communities and , more generally , of tolerance and non _ discrimination based on religion or belief .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
It was pointed out that many if not all national procedural laws contemplated cases where a party ( the foreign representative in the current provision ) who demonstrated a legal interest in the outcome of a dispute between two other parties was permitted by the court deciding the dispute to be heard in the proceedings .  
However , the view was also expressed that , for those legal systems where the words " to intervene " were not well understood , those words might be given a different interpretation , and in particular that they might carry the meaning that the foreign representative might substitute for the debtor in judicial actions .  
A view was expressed that , as an alternative to the enumeration of the grounds on which recognition might be refused , the Model Provisions could contain a definition of the effects limited to coordination and cooperation , to be granted to the recognized foreign proceeding when a local proceeding is already pending in the enacting State .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
Observing scientifically the changes in the international situation , Mr . Deng Xiaoping led us in the reshaping of an international strategy adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace , safeguarding world peace , promoting world development and opposing hegemonism and power politics , thus opening up a new situation in China 's relations with foreign countries in a new era , and making historic contributions to developing and strengthening China 's friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
It was stated that paragraph ( 1 ) essentially contained a provision on the allocation of liability to the domestic certification authority in the event that the foreign certificate was found to be defective , a liability to be derived from draft article H . Paragraph ( 2 ) , in turn , was not concerned with liability issues , but with the legal effects that might be produced directly by a foreign certificate , for example where that foreign certificate would be relied upon in the context of a dispute before the courts of the enacting State . 
It was stated that , in assessing the trustworthiness of a foreign certificate , the recipient of a digitally signed message accompanied by the certificate should consider a number of questions , such as the following : whether the certification authority issuing the certificate was authorized to act abroad ; whether the digital signature of the certification authority was authentic ; whether legal recourse was available against the certification authority ; whether the digital signature had been recognized to produce legal effects ; and whether the digital signature could be enforced against its author .  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
However , the concern was voiced that , when read in conjunction with draft article B , which required such prior approval for certification authorities established in the enacting State , paragraph ( 1 ) might be read as allowing the recognition of certificates issued by foreign certification authorities which had not been authorized to operate under domestic rules , while denying legal effectiveness to certificates issued by domestic certification authorities that had not received the required authorization in the enacting State .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Both recurrent and non-recurrent statistical publications of the Statistics Division are distributed , free of charge , to permanent missions , foreign ministries and other official recipients on mailing lists maintained by the Office of Conference Services of the Secretariat and to national and international statistical offices and United Nations agencies and others who assist the Division in data collection or analysis , on mailing lists maintained by the Division .  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development , and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .

Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to identify and promote new policy options at the national , subregional and regional levels for the removal of constraints on the economic and social development efforts of these countries , with emphasis on the adoption of measures for increased mobilization of domestic and foreign resources , trade and private sector development , public sector reform , and provision of economic advice , on request , to Governments with limited internal capacity .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
As for trade statistics , the mission focused attention on : ( i ) ascertaining the technical capabilities and work plan of the PCBS with regard to the compilation , processing , analysis , and dissemination of Palestinian foreign trade statistics ; ( ii ) identifying the nature and extent of needs of the PCBS for technical assistance in the area of international trade statistics ; and , ( iii ) developing relevant proposals for manpower training .  
These should provide in particular protection of contractual agreements and an even playing field between domestic and foreign investors ( therefore preventing discrimination against foreign investors ) , and policy formulation should be consistent and well planned so that partial reversals or inconsistent legislation are not implemented later .  
These include the existence of a properly functioning banking system with the ability to mobilize an adequate level of domestic savings ; a legal system that protects private property ; the existence of company laws that allow multiple ownership as a precondition for share ownership by the public ; and the freedom of foreign investors to own domestic assets in clearly specified sectors of the economy .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
Thailand believed that industrial development facilitated economic growth and technological change , as well as creating dynamic linkages with the agricultural and service sectors and contributing to foreign exchange earnings that were key to overall development .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
It could be argued that a staged approach for the penetration of foreign markets , starting from domestic markets and moving to regional ones which displayed similar sociocultural characteristics , could be a viable option .  
One State19 reported that legislative amendments had been made to allow for proper control over foreign entertainers , while another20 noted that women migrant workers in the private sector were provided with the same rights as male migrant workers , as well as additional benefits , such as maternity leave and child protection .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
Notwithstanding these positive indications , the continent as a whole is still suffering from an increasing external debt burden , receding standards of living , low-level social services and health care for its citizens and a diminishing capability to compete and to attract foreign investments .  
The discussions will be videotaped and the taped footage will be utilized to produce a one-hour course on international law which will be distributed , subject to financial constraints , to schools , universities , research institutions , parliamentarians and foreign ministries to promote both knowledge and understanding of international law and international relations .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development . performance and the unexploited opportunities available . 
On the other hand , they themselves engage in massive sales of advanced weapons and equipment to sensitive regions , infringing upon the national sovereignty of other countries and damaging regional peace and stability .  The Chinese Government adheres to Mr . Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on diplomatic endeavours and firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance , which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed , inter alia , to increase export earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment , it is essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
While the formulation of common standards for prudential oversight and management of risk situations and efforts to involve developing countries and countries with transition economies were welcome , States remained responsible for the establishment of a stable and predictable national environment for foreign investment .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
At the same time , it is clear from the correlation between export expansion , inflows of foreign direct investment and industrial economic growth that countries following inappropriate policies and lacking adequate skills and technological capacities will be left behind in the globalization process .  
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
A world free of foreign colonization and occupation , in which relations between States were based on mutual understanding and equality , would be more peaceful , secure and stable . 
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign portfolio equity investment flows .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
The Commission encourages countries to continue to pursue coherent and coordinated policies , including the creation of a possible domestic legal framework and a stable economic environment , to attract foreign direct investment in order to benefit from its contribution to development .  
The speaker listed several issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( iv ) trade in services .  
The speaker listed a number of issues that were pertinent to the economic development of the LDCs : ( i ) agricultural development ; ( ii ) foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ; ( iii ) debt burden ; ( iv ) official development assistance ( ODA ) ; and ( v ) trade in services .  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Reiterates its grave concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards any significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;

The facts in the Nwankavo case , where there was overwhelming evidence of abuse leading finally to some welcome disciplinary action against the law enforcement officials involved , suggest a judicial disposition precipitately and prematurely to believe the police and to disbelieve the foreign accused / complainant , as well as a reluctance fully to rectify the original wrong .  
In 1994 , in keeping with its consistent goal of limiting documentation and streamlining its report to the General Assembly , the Special Committee had recommended to the Assembly that , in preparing the general working papers on the Territories , the Secretariat should , where applicable , incorporate under separate headings those sections relating to foreign economic and other interests and those on military activities and arrangements in those Territories .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;

It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
This encouraging trend has been achieved through the adoption and pursuit by Governments of policies and measures aimed at ensuring , among others , macroeconomic stability , inflows of foreign direct investment , open and free markets and stable and transparent legal and regulatory frameworks .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
The outcome of our recently held parliamentary elections has confirmed that this basic orientation of our foreign policy will remain unchanged and is supported by the overwhelming majority of the Polish people . 
The efforts at domestic stabilization through reorganization of the State and the reconciliation of opinions and the return to work of the civilian population are accompanied by other efforts aimed at achieving peace and regional stability in order to create economic and political conditions conducive to productive national and foreign investment .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
This integration is of great benefit to national and foreign investors thanks to the country 's economic and other potential such as its geographical location , in relation to major regional markets , its transit role , its role as a supplier of hydroelectric power to neighbouring countries and export producer , using the country 's raw materials , and its innumerable natural tourist attractions .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Lastly , with regard to the question of foreign debt , there is now broad agreement that without favourable treatment for the stock of African debt , particularly in the most heavily indebted countries , no economic recovery programme can produce the desired long-term positive effects .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
Some of the countries on our continent are facing famine , endemic diseases , AIDS , fratricidal wars internal factors that exacerbate poverty inside those countries , to which are added such external causes as the fall in the price of commodities , the burden of foreign debt , barriers to access to foreign markets and the drastic drop of nearly 30 per cent in official development assistance .  
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
The continuing decline in official development assistance , coupled with a simultaneous growing reliance on bilateral and direct foreign investment , serve as unmistakable indications of this unhealthy process .  
The sanctions imposed on Iraq and the foreign interference in its domestic affairs have given rise to clandestine excavations that have enabled their organizers to appropriate and sell cultural property and rare art objects of inestimable value , as well as manuscripts and antique books .  
That outcome was averted thanks to initiatives taken and to the resolve of the Governments of Central America and friendly countries , which took the proper steps to find a negotiated political solution that responded to the aspirations of the Central American peoples , and in particular to the sovereign right of States to live in peace and freely to determine their own future free from any foreign interference in matters that are essentially within their internal jurisdiction . 
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
In their efforts to attract foreign private investment , many Governments are fearful of the consequences of raising direct taxes ; in the short term at least , low rates of taxation or tax relief seem an obvious and quick way of attracting capital .  
In the face of the economic slowdown in Western Europe , and thus the slower growth of exports to the main foreign markets of these countries , aggregate demand was boosted by strong private consumption , made possible by rising real wages , and increased investment .  
The Government considered that the use of force , foreign occupation or domination , and unilateral economic coercion or international sanctions to resolve conflicts , halt violations of human rights and promote democracy , were factors in creating refugees and mass exoduses .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
The Amman Workshop reaffirms that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu .  
This historic moment is one more proof of the positive trend of the development of relationships , and an affirmation of the foreign policy orientations , of both parties , and represents a step forward towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability , coinciding with the major long-term efforts of the Republic of Macedonia in the region of the Balkans , in Europe as a whole and throughout the world .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
On 21 September 1996 , the Vice-President of SLORC , Gen . Maung Aye , is reported to have declared that the military could remain in power longer if elements receiving foreign support caused disorder and on 25 September 1996 , the NLM indicated that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi would soon be charged with political crimes as she was conspiring with former colonial powers and aiding exiled dissident groups in a plot to overthrow the Government .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
Fourthly , unilateral internalization at the producer 's level could be beneficial especially in the long run , but short-term costs and the uncertainty about foreign exchange earnings , global commodity demand , and socio-economic implications are formidable constraints58 as they have been in the removal of trade barriers . 59 Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore likely to be important to encourage internalization at the producers level and facilitate the reflection of these producer prices in international commodity prices and / or provide finance for environmentally sound processing methods . 
Heavier penalties may be applied under other statutes for acquiring a passport or another travel document in an unlawful manner by providing false information or intentionally concealing facts or contributing to incorrect information on official documents ; acquiring more than one passport or travel document for an unlawful purpose ; altering or removing parts of official travel documents for an unlawful purpose ; entering or exiting the country without reporting to passport control authorities ; or taking part in the concealment of a foreign national .  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner , but without in any way precluding , impeding or delaying international , regional or national actions to further the implementation of the present Declaration ;  
Van der Stoel 's allegations concerning mass arrests in northern Iraq are pure fabrications , since everyone is aware of that region 's special status and the consequences of the abnormal situation in which it finds itself , being outside the scope of the State administration due to foreign military intervention and the establishment of air exclusion zones .  
The principal policy issues to be addressed included measures affecting the entry and operations of foreign investors ; standards of treatment as applied to TNCs , notably issues of national treatment , MFN treatment , and fair and equitable treatment ; broader concerns relating to measures dealing with the proper functioning of the market , including such issues as RBPs ; and investment protection and the settlement of disputes .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ fourth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
The solution to the problem of terrorism lay in addressing its root causes , as reaffirmed in any number of General Assembly resolutions , such as 40 / 61 and 46 / 51 , which urged States to pay special attention to situations involving flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and those involving alien domination and foreign occupation , that might give rise to international terrorism .  
No comparison should be drawn between the legitimate struggle of peoples against colonial or foreign domination , and terrorist acts instigated , organized , directed or financed by one State or any of its organizations against another with the aim of undermining its political , economic and social system or subverting its Government .  
The Ministry of the Interior had established a department whose responsibilities included the programme of reparation for acts committed between 1976 and 1983 , while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instituted a department with responsibility for shaping foreign policy in the area of human rights and the advancement of women and for coordinating with international bodies in that field . 
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
Reaffirms , in accordance with the Amman workshop conclusions , that all human rights , civil and political , economic , social and cultural , including the right to self _ determination of people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation , as well as the right of return , are universal , interdependent and indivisible and are legal rights stricto sensu ;  
The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding thus provides a quick freeze essential to prevent fraud , protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation .  
While in the majority of African countries manufacturing output stagnated , strong performance was recorded for the northern and eastern subregions , with growth rates of 4.2 per cent and 5.3 per cent , respectively , sustained by strong domestic demand as well as buoyant inflows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .  
While the mobilization of external resources should target and tap into the growing non-debt-creating arrangements and particularly direct foreign investment ( FDI ) , the domestic counterpart should seek to exploit the rich potential within both the urban and rural milieus .  
Nevertheless , a number of countries ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Slovenia and Croatia ) have achieved significant success in lowering and controlling their inflation rates ; but one consequence of this success is that they have been attracting large and rapid inflows of foreign capital which threaten to destabilize domestic monetary control and to push up the exchange rate , thereby further weakening the competitiveness of the tradeables sector .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
Further , a stable and transparent legal framework that provides for respect for and enforcement of property rights , the rule of law and the tackling of corruption , as well as transparent , efficient and accountable public administration , are conducive to domestic and foreign investment and capital inflows .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
Key determinants for attracting external private sector capital are , inter alia , a stable domestic political , legal and economic environment , based on the rule of law , sound economic policies and an openness to foreign investment .  
A combination of grant aid , concessional loans and technical assistance which can contribute to the financing of the necessary economic and social infrastructure , together with strategies designed inter alia to increase exports earnings , attract foreign direct investment and reduce external debt , can provide sufficient conditions for development .  
In its resolution 1992 / 50 on the fraudulent or unlawful enrichment of top State officials , the Commission on Human Rights pointed clearly to the responsibility of the North in connection with the commission of that crime in the countries of the South and thus raised the question , still unclear in international law , of the restitution to despoiled peoples , for reinvestment in local economic , social and cultural development , of the funds which their leaders have extorted from them , usually with the complicity of foreign banks .  
Reiterates grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they are being expanded , upgraded and modernized , including by the introduction of sophisticated weaponry , and the lack of progress towards and significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus , which threaten to raise tensions both on the island and in the region and complicate efforts to negotiate an overall political settlement ;  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
All States should recognize the negative impact on anti _ trafficking activities by customs , border-control and law enforcement authorities created by absence or loss of effective exercise of sovereignty in any part of a State because of internal strife , foreign occupation or other causes , which may give rise to illicit transit traffic in drugs , and should condemn any violation of national borders and territorial integrity ;  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
Warren Marik has acknowledged that considerable sums of money , at least $ 100-million , were swallowed up by these efforts , just as he has acknowledged the role played by the United States Senate Intelligence Committee in mounting a secret action against the legitimate authorities of Iraq and preparing a programme of aggression against Iraq to topple the regime in power , despite the duplicitous statements by senior United States Administration officials to the effect that they would not use such heinous procedures against foreign Heads of State .  
They also provide basic protection to foreign investors , such as : national treatment ; fair and equitable treatment ; legal protection and guarantees ( e.g . , expropriation ) ; transfer of funds and repatriation of profits and capital invested ; transparency ; and recourse to international means for the settlement of disputes .  
They shall promote the harmonization of their countries ' national legislation on combating organized transnational crime and terrorism , including illegal trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors , explosives and other hazardous materials , hijacking of motor transport , counterfeiting , money-laundering , crime in the area of foreign economic and banking transactions and taxation , and illegal migration and illegal crossing of borders .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
She was disappointed and alarmed at the continuing real decline in official development assistance over the past four years and the overwhelming concentration of foreign direct investment in only a handful of countries .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
In closing , she emphasized the important role of the Commission in the years to come , especially with regard to the ongoing and increasing process of globalization driven by increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign-portfolio-equity investment flows .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
Beyond the human cost , debt had created serious obstacles to economic growth by absorbing up to one fifth of export earnings , exhausting their limited stocks of foreign exchange and undermining their ability to engage in international trade on more equitable terms .  
Specific procedural and legal problems include identification of , and communication with , the proper domestic authorities whose consent is required before boarding a foreign ship , the inability to exercise jurisdiction over domestic vessels or nationals outside territorial waters , and the inability to exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
In Eritrea , foreign nationals , whatever their origin , were treated justly , in accordance with the law and their human rights were respected ; there had not been a single incident involving ethnic or national minorities in the seven years since independence .  
Thanks to the prudent policy pursued by the Government and the National Bank , its domestic public debt was low and its gross foreign debt among the lowest in Central Europe .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
He urged the international community to increase direct foreign investment , especially in Africa , as it was insufficient despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by the developing countries in order to create a favourable economic environment . 
His Government attached great significance to regional economic development and had declared Rajin-Sonbong a free trade zone with a view to creating a favourable environment for foreign investment , supported by relevant legislation .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
It was now possible to face the future with a degree of realistic optimism , especially as the economic indicators during the current decade represented a clear improvement over previous decades in terms of growth , trade and direct foreign investment .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
One was to reject everything that was foreign , on the reasoning that each countrys situation was unique and that external influences tended to be irrelevant at best or to undermine local uniqueness and cultural identity at worst .  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
Globally , ODA has fallen to just 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996 the lowest level since foreign aid was institutionalized with the Marshall Plan about 50 years ago .  
The gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates continued to widen , discouraging domestic production and leading to a situation whereby foreign currency is used side by side with the national one , in both official and private transactions .  
The high level of unhedged private external debt made the option of devaluing the baht a painful choice that was avoided until foreign exchange reserves had been nearly exhausted in defending the exchange rate .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
In order to encourage domestic investment and to attract foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , it was essential to have in place a stable , supportive , effective and transparent legal framework .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
With a view to fostering participation of foreign companies and maximizing competition , the contracting authority may wish to cause the invitations to the preselection proceedings to be published also in a language customarily used in international trade , in a newspaper of wide international circulation or in a relevant trade publication or technical or professional journal of wide international circulation .  
International investment agreements ( IIAs ) have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment with a view to attracting foreign direct investment which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved .  
Most IIAs _ and particularly BITs _ have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment , with a view towards promoting and protecting foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved . 
In cases where the definition of investment is circumscribed to foreign direct investment only , this has been defined by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) as international investment that reflects the objective of a resident entity in one economy obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy .  
In this connection , we believe that the issues of trade and environment , access to the markets of the developed countries , direct foreign investment , access to environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms and official development assistance require concerted action by the international community .  
Owing to our physical handicap of being a landlocked country , Nepal has obvious additional difficulties in participating on equal terms in the global trade regime and attracting foreign direct investments .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Financing of technology transfer and accompanying know-how and capacity-building through official development assistance ; multilateral technical assistance , public and private partnerships , joint ventures and foreign direct investments ;  
For that purpose , the Guide helps identify areas of law that are typically most relevant to private capital investment in public infrastructure projects and discusses the content of those laws which would be conducive to attracting private capital , national and foreign .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
From Argentina to Ghana , State intervention in the economy has been drastically curtailed , protectionist barriers to Northern imports have been eliminated wholesale , restrictions on foreign investment have been lifted and , through export-first policies , internal economies have been more tightly integrated into the capitalist world market dominated by transnational corporations .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
Obviously , however , development of the private sector was impossible without support at the public level , which should include , inter alia , demonopolization , the introduction of tax incentives , a sound legal environment and the promotion of domestic and foreign investment .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
Force was especially demonstrated through demands that an " international military presence " , meaning foreign troops , be accepted even before a political settlement was reached , although the scope and character of international presence had been defined in the agreement concluded between Yugoslavia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
To counter the perceived threat and build a " clean social system " , 2 the regime launched a uniquely thorough revolution whereby all pre-existing economic , social and cultural institutions were abolished , all foreign influences were expunged and the entire population was transformed into a collective workforce , required to work at breakneck speed to build up the country 's economic strength .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
In its resolution 1193 ( 1998 ) of 28 August 1998 , the Security Council identified a further relevant factor when it noted the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in Afghanistan , including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict , such interference continued unabated .  
Belarus stresses that the use of military force against Yugoslavia without a proper decision of the only competent international body , which is undoubtedly the United Nations Security Council , as well as any introduction of foreign military contingents against the wish of the Government of Yugoslavia , qualify as an act of aggression , with all ensuing responsibility for its humanitarian , military and political consequences .  
The latter has , moreover , called for the convening of an international conference to define terrorism , to elaborate internationally acceptable criteria for differentiating between terrorism and national struggle for liberation from foreign occupation and to study the underlying causes of acts of violence that stem from the violation of basic human rights , misery , frustration , a sense of grievance and despair .  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority .  
Decides to consider at its fifty _ sixth session the question of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self _ determination under the agenda item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation . 
The secretariat also provides or requests high quality and timely information to and from ministries of foreign affairs , permanent missions to the United Nations , organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , and other international organizations , on a wide range of legal and technical issues related to the functions and decisions of the Commission and other United Nations legislative bodies on drug control .  
Provision and receipt of higher quality and more timely information to / from ministries of foreign affairs , permanent missions to the United Nations , organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and other international organizations on a wide range of legal and technical issues related to the functions and decisions of the Commission and other United Nations legislative bodies on drug control ;  
While a critical analysis of the contribution of the 20 / 20 initiative to the promotion of basic social services was urged , interested parties also underscored that the initiative leads to the combination of efforts of both donors and recipients of aid in a most visible way , matching domestic funds with an equal amount of foreign financial resources .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
Indeed , in the future , investors will look more carefully at macro - and microeconomic policies [ 24 ] , most particularly at : high economic growth rate , the degree of exchange rate stability , level of foreign exchange reserves , general macroeconomic stability , health of domestic banking system , quality of stock market regulatory framework , quality of domestic accounting / disclosure standards and degree of investors rights protection .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
It is imperative that the Security Council take urgent measures to condemn most strongly and to halt the NATO aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , an independent , sovereign country and a founding Member State of the United Nations and to request the withdrawal of foreign forces built up by NATO at the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , threatening thereby to escalate the aggression .  
It is incomprehensible to request the withdrawal of the legitimate forces of a sovereign State from its own territory instead of calling for an urgent ending of foreign military aggression , killing of civilians and destruction of civilian targets .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty _ sixth session the item entitled The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and to consider the situation in occupied Palestine under that item , as a matter of high priority . 
The proposed Convention would be built on the following main pillars : the creation of free trade zones , building on existing regional groups to facilitate the liberalization process , and the granting of special and differential treatment for the least developed ACP countries to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system , reinforce their institutional capacity and create a favourable policy framework to attract foreign investment and develop a dynamic private sector .  
In fulfilling its role as a catalyst of change , EBRD encourages co-financing and foreign direct investment from the private and public sectors , helps to mobilize domestic capital and provides technical cooperation in relevant areas .  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
Along with the consolidation of the democratic process , the country is yielding satisfactory and encouraging rates of economic growth , as reflected in the growth of the GDP , control of inflation , stability of the national currency , increase in foreign investment and gradual improvement in the living conditions of the people .  
Other sources of technology transfer such as licensing , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) leading to joint ventures , original equipment manufacturing ( OEM ) and other subcontracting arrangements serve a dual purpose , providing rapid access to technology as well as access to global markets .  
This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
For the information of the Sub-Commission , the secretariat has also prepared ( annex II ) a list of country situations currently being considered by the Commission under the agenda items entitled Organization of the work of the session , The right of peoples to self _ determination and its application to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation and Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights . the occupied Arab territories ,  
This has been achieved by making relevant amendments to the Access to space action area , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by it in this connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
Rodolfo Stavenhagen states that the entire population of the Americas decreased by 95 per cent in the century and a half following the first encounter .  10 / The intent to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity and bring them under the sovereignty of foreign monarchs created widespread havoc , despite some early attempts at friendly treatment .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations has removed some important obstacles to transit trade , also enabling private sector transport operators in many landlocked and transit developing countries to retain some hard currency for purchase of spare parts and equipment .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
These obstacles are : in the social sphere , religious and cultural diversity ; and in the economic area , a steady decline in official development assistance , the excessive burden of foreign debt , deterioration in the terms of trade and the difficulties of gaining access to the international markets for our goods .

Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Complementary policies are needed in a number of areas , for example in respect of supporting proper access to investment financing and venture capital ; facilitating access to new technologies and to match-making with foreign partners ; active labour market policies , including retraining for new technologies and activities ; unemployment insurance ; and the provision of basic infrastructure , industrial utilities and complementary services .  
UNCTAD 's future work should aim at improving developing countries understanding of the impact of foreign direct investment , through transnational corporations , on international trade , technology flows , enterprise development and their development prospects generally .  
Special attention needs to be given to improving the understanding of the interdependence of foreign direct investment , domestic investment , technological change and technology flows , the policies and practices of multinational firms and the evolution of corporate governance .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
A large number of non-governmental organizations - international , foreign and domestic - work in Uganda in areas related to the right to education ( such as social development , literacy , special education , gender , human rights ) but few explicitly address that right , thus exacerbating the paucity of conceptual and analytical work necessary for its promotion and protection .  
The first session , devoted to globalization competition and development , reviewed three issues of major importance for developing countries and economies in transition , namely : ( i ) foreign direct ( FDI ) , mergers and alliances ; ( ii ) deregulation , demonopolization and privatization ; and ( iii ) intellectual property rights , competition and transfer of technology .  
This constitutes an adverse structural shift in the economy , though one which still could be reversed through sustained export growth driven by a combination of domestic and foreign investment and further industrial and agricultural production diversification .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .

The Bureau 's recommendation that the mandates of the Special Rapporteur on structural adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt be merged will increase the existing imbalance between individual rights and collective rights , especially at a time when the international community is struggling to address the negative effects of globalization of the economy and the liberalization of trade and the different challenges resulting from their implementation .  
Although trade expansion can be an instrument for fostering the development process , official development assistance ( ODA ) also plays a critical role in financing important capital investments , particularly in social and physical infrastructure , for which trade flows and foreign direct investment if available are not always an effective substitute .  
The former , with inconvertible local currencies and relatively low foreign private capital inflows , proved less vulnerable to the effects of the crisis .  
It emphasized that , without a sustained and decisive reduction in their external debt and debt service obligations , the growth prospects of the least developed countries and their ability to attract foreign direct investment would remain limited .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
No doubt the shared use of facilities increases the legal and jurisdictional complexities of project financing , but increasing experience on how to tackle ownership issues has been gained through international water-sharing projects . 47 Also , the private financing of multi-country infrastructure projects creates complementary interests between landlocked and coastal countries as transit infrastructure directly generates foreign exchange . 
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Guided by the desire to contribute , in its own way , to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation , and in line with its foreign policy aimed at contributing to regional peace and security , as well as ensuring the country 's national security by political and diplomatic means , in 1992 , Mongolia declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone . 
The provision to the effect that the revenues and budgets of all physical and legal persons will be made in foreign currencies is along the same lines , as well as the paradoxical provision that a compulsory payment may be paid in dinars with a charge of " an additional administrative fee to cover handling and transaction costs " .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .

Full realization of the rights of all peoples , including those living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , to self-determination enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the international covenants on human rights , as well as in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 ( XV ) of 14 December 1960 ;  
Costa Rica , Croatia , Singapore and Togo noted that the same standard with regard to remuneration , conditions of work and terms of employment applied to foreign and national workers , with women migrant workers having the same rights with regard to job security , extended vacation , night and overtime work as national women workers . 15 Costa Rica provided comprehensive information regarding migration into its territory , including penalties for illegal migration . 
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Singapore reported on educational materials which informed foreign workers that they were protected under national laws to the same extent as local workers , where they could seek assistance , and that abusive employers would be punished and barred from employing foreign workers in the future . 
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .

Emphasis must be placed on the Organizations crucial role in addressing the underlying causes of international political crises , including the right to self-determination for peoples under foreign occupation and alien domination , and in the economic and social fields .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
The decline in the rate of growth of LDCs recorded since 1996 was not only attributable to austerity measures related to the implementation of economic reforms but also to declining trends in ODA , the low level of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , and depressed commodity prices .  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
Africas continuing marginalization was increasingly defined by its very low absolute level of exports and decreasing share in world trade , inadequate inflows of foreign investment and ODA , persisting external debt burden , collapse in commodity prices , enduring supply-side bottlenecks and a less propitious external economic environment .  
The risks involved for lenders included ( a ) the difficulty in forecasting traffic and determining what amount of tolls users would be prepared to pay ; ( b ) the fact that users usually paid in domestic currency , so that foreign investors faced a currency mismatch between their investment and their cash-flow return ; and ( c ) the risk that municipalities would change the tolls to please their constituency , in particular before elections .  
However , key parts of the deterioration ( such as the accumulation in the spring of 1997 by the central bank of Thailand of a large part of the forward exchange liabilities that depleted its net foreign exchange reserves ) may take place during short periods , so that improved disclosure would not necessarily protect the debtor from sudden reactions by creditors and investors which are highly concentrated in time .  
In that regard , foreign direct investment , technical assistance for national capacity-building and export outlets were but a few of the indispensable conditions for the participation of the South in world trade .  Vigorous and sustainable economic growth , which could greatly foster employment and poverty eradication efforts , was vital .  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
General Assembly resolution 53 / 175 stressed the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment ( preambular para . 12 ) and the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth ( para .  9 ) .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .

Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access . 
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the policies of reform being implemented by African countries , their economic situation remains critical and African recovery and development continue to be severely hindered by , inter alia , the persistence of lower commodity prices and the heavy debt burden and are also substantially affected by the levels of official development assistance and foreign direct investment , as well as the ongoing conflicts in some regions of the continent ,

Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
The Russian Federation has repeatedly stated in a number of international forums that it rejects the growing trend towards unilateral extraterritorial application of national laws and measures affecting other States ' trade and foreign relations , since these laws and measures breach international law , violate the principles of the sovereign equality of States and respect for national sovereignty , and undermine peaceful coexistence .  
Given those circumstances , the ministers for foreign affairs of the Group of 77 had emphasized at the meeting held in New York on 24 September 1999 that , while globalization was often unpredictable and uneven , it could , if properly managed and based on strengthened cooperation , open the way for enduring and equitable growth at the international and national levels . 
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
It was interesting to note that it had been suggested that when other authorities could commit the State unilaterally at the international level , that capacity should be limited to circumstances in which the persons concerned were given an official mandate to conduct foreign policy in their field of competence and where their counterparts , to whom the unilateral declaration was addressed , were fully cognizant of that fact .  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;

The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
Secondly , a terrible dearth of resources results from the burden of debt servicing , dwindling external resource flows , the drop in official development assistance , the decline in direct foreign investment and the reduction in export earnings , all of which has not allowed basic social services to be funded .  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .  
In order to meet the requirements of domestic resource mobilization to strengthen the fragile economies in Africa and reduce poverty there , current levels of external funding sources , such as official development assistance and foreign direct investment , need to be increased .  
The latter will direct part of the surplus revenue flowing from our fiscal policies and will balance social investment with macroeconomic stabilization and the amortization of the foreign debt as a budgetary priority .  
The Government of our Republic has consistently maintained a policy of providing jobs , free medical treatment and free education to all people , even amid serious temporary economic difficulties created by economic blockades of foreign forces and natural disasters which have recurred over a number of consecutive years .  
In this connection , improved terms of trade , access to international markets , increased direct foreign investments , alleviation of the external debt burden and an expanded resource base are some of the crucial issues that have to be seriously considered .  
Reflecting the fundamental new direction that international relations have recently taken , the Courts subject matter has also dramatically expanded to include a wide variety of issues : maritime boundaries , territorial sovereignty , the use of force , non-interference in the internal affairs of States , diplomatic relations , hostage-taking , the right to asylum , nationality , expropriation of foreign property and rights of passage .  
They include numerous illegal measures that interfere with the legitimate economic and commercial activities of foreign companies based outside United States jurisdiction , as well as complete prohibitions not only against the Republic of Cuba , but against all Cuban nationals , without exception , residing in Cuban territory , who are prevented from engaging in any transactions , while all of their property , deposits , savings , inheritances and pensions in the United States have been confiscated . 
The blockade has created countless obstacles to Cubas economic development ; it has made it impossible for Cuba to acquire products , equipment , goods , services and technology ; it has deprived it of funding and credits ; it has inflicted severe damage on its foreign trade by depressing the prices of what we sell and raising the costs of imports and transportation ; it has affected every sector of the national economy , with severe consequences for the living conditions of our people .  
The Argentine Republic has promulgated an act establishing that foreign legislation which is aimed , directly or indirectly , at restricting or impending the free flow of trade and the movement of capital , goods or persons to the detriment of a given country or group of countries shall neither be applicable nor have legal effects of any kind within Argentine territory .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
Because of the continued organized plunder of Iraqs archaeological artifacts , foreign museums and galleries are packed with these antiques , as are the special collections retained by art traffickers and professional collectors .  
With a unified currency , with unified political , economic and foreign policies , with defined borders and now with the planned military deterrence force of its own , it is obvious that a regional seat is a logical necessity and consequence .  
The Working Group noted with concern violations of the civil and economic rights of migrant women workers , including foreign contract workers , who were subjected to ill-treatment , limited personal freedom and inadequate or no payment for their work , without the possibility of recourse to the legal system of the receiving country for justice .

In order to identify the adjustments to macroeconomic and sectoral policies that will ensure better integration of the employment objective and growth strategy , the decision-makers and the economic and social partners need thorough research , particularly in the spheres of cost evaluation , jobs and unemployment , fiscal , monetary and budgetary measures , and foreign trade .  
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
We have established diplomatic relations and are developing beneficial cooperation with all of them , in accordance with the provisions of resolution 50-80 B . In accordance with our foreign policy of open borders and equality and taking advantage of our geostrategic position as a central State in the Balkans we are becoming an important place for the development of international cooperation in all of south-eastern Europe . 
Moreover , in the case of securitization of mortgage loans , an assignment against the consumer-debtor may materially increase the burden of risk imposed on the consumer-debtor ( if , e.g . , the mortgage loan is assigned by the friendly local savings and loans bank to a foreign lender , who may be more aggressive in the collection of the outstanding amounts of the loan or in handling any variable interest rate ) .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
In its resolution 1998-24 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint for a three-year period a special rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to the Commission on an annual basis , beginning at its fifty-fifth session , an analytical report on the implementation of the resolution .  
National decisions and the capacity to manage land resources sustainably can also be constrained by external factors and the impacts of inappropriate development strategies pursued in the past , including unequal negotiations for rights to exploit natural resources by national and foreign companies , and poorly designed projects financed by donors which have been based on purely economic considerations .  
Indeed , accelerated economic growth is also of paramount importance if Africa is to reverse its increasing marginalization as reflected by quantitative indicators , particularly its small share of world trade , the limited inflows of foreign direct investment , its heavy debt burden , the relatively low utilization of communication technology , the falling standard of education , the deteriorating health services and the declining food self-sufficiency ratio .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
Along this line of thinking , the Minister of Social Security , in a very fruitful and frank exchange of views with the Representative , spoke of the high intellectual potential of the displaced and the considerable amount of current foreign investment in the country , suggesting that these two elements combined could be capitalized upon through skills-training and job creation in the field of the latest technology .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
Besides being sometimes needed to satisfy national constitutional and other requirements , the enactment of express legislative authorization may be an important measure to foster the confidence of potential investors , national or foreign , in a national policy to promote private sector investment in infrastructure .  
Although it seems obvious , we must remember that this draft resolution calls for negotiating the complete , comprehensive prohibition of anti-personnel landmines , and that independent of the irresponsible or indiscriminate use of landmines on many occasions , it is no secret to anyone that even now , many countries use landmines to defend themselves against foreign aggression .  
This can be achieved through direct government policies , joint ventures with local private initiatives , and foreign investment from regional and international public and private banks .  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
And for an archipelagic State like Seychelles , the aerial surveillance of its huge exclusive economic zone against foreign illegal fishing is much enhanced by good intra-island telecommunication services .  
China Road and Bridge stated that under the relevant laws of China , a Chinese national is not entitled to work abroad unless it is with a company or an organization authorized by the Chinese Government to engage in a foreign economic cooperation business .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
In order to do so , airlines have to be attractive enough to be accepted as members of alliances , as partners in code-sharing and other cooperative arrangements , as enterprises that may be successfully privatized through national or foreign capital , or as companies capable of absorbing market solutions such as franchising or other arrangements with world-class airlines .  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
Consideration of development financing should include the topics of ODA , primary commodity export profits and external debt , which should be addressed through genuine economic cooperation on the basis of international partnership and solidarity and of private capital flows , including foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , for financing trade and innovative sources of funding .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
Furthermore , the least developed suffered from declining official development assistance , heavy indebtedness , falling export earnings owing to low commodity prices , virtually no foreign direct investment , and the effects of the structural adjustment imposed on them by IMF , which was why they had major difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources .  
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
In addition to lacking sufficient local market knowledge , foreign firms may also be liable in their own country if they are prohibited from offering bribes by their national foreign bribery legislation or if their Governments have ratified international agreements such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions .  
The types of acts publishable under the Convention will include corrupt activities involving an international civil servant , a foreign public official , a judge or other official of an international court . 23 The importance of addressing organized crimes perpetration of and involvement in corruption is undisputed . 
The Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable by effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable with those applicable to bribery of domestic officials .  
It must not be forgotten that the European Union already has a single currency , is developing common foreign and defence policies , and even recently appointed a high official to coordinate that undertaking .  
To make matters worse , they find it difficult without the requisite technology and human resource base to attract foreign direct investment , which is increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging economies .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
We consider it of prime importance that the renewed Council be a representative and balanced organ through the inclusion of new members , from industrially developed countries and influential developing States alike , pursuing independent foreign policies .  
This draft resolution points out that stable and accountable governance is essential for economic development , and it recognizes the importance of private capital , particularly foreign direct investment , in development financing .  
In the context of judicial cooperation , they covered issues such as controlled delivery , undercover operations , maritime cooperation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , use of foreign evidence , asset forfeiture and witness protection .  
The recent slowdown in economic activity , the sharp worsening of foreign reserves and severe contraction of public expenditure on basic services , are inflicting further hardship on the poor .  
While the need for increased foreign direct investment remains paramount , we also wish to point out that our developed partners should continue to assist us and reverse the current trend of the decline in official development assistance .  
It is important that the global public is concerned about the economic , social and environmental consequences of foreign and domestic investment .  
Undertaking studies on the level of national savings , the development of stable and transparent domestic financial resources , monetary systems , foreign capital flows and the financial aspects of social policies ;  
It is essential to focus on creating an economic environment at the global and the national level that is conducive to longterm investment in productive capacity by both indigenous and foreign private investors .  
The situation is further aggravated by the traditional problems of low rates of capital accumulation , inadequate flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfer and the scarcity of a dynamic indigenous entrepreneurial class .  
The LDCs continued to be marginalized in global economic activities , ODA had declined substantially and the external debt burden had reached alarming proportions , while foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and exports and imports had been reduced .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
In the context of judicial cooperation , they covered issues such as controlled delivery , undercover operations , maritime cooperation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , use of foreign evidence , asset forfeiture and witness protection .  
The ongoing war has contributed to continuing human rights violations , sustained interference by foreign Powers and farreaching environmental damage , not to mention the staggering social cost of the long civil war .

Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
Furthermore , the threat may not be determined on the basis of ulterior political motives there must be genuine international concern behind the sanctions , not the foreign or domestic policy considerations of a single State or group of States .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Polands solid growth , macroeconomic stability , sound monetary policy , established banking system , modernized industry and reformed pension system had attracted foreign investors and helped it to withstand the global economic turbulence of recent years . 
In the light of the intensifying fighting and the worsening humanitarian situation , I decided to convene a meeting of the six plus two group on 15 September at the level of foreign ministers .  
There are positive signs for increasing the stability of capital markets , with the emergence of mutual funds , provident funds , the use of fund managers and the concomitant decline in reliance on individual domestic investors and foreign investors .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
The Malaysian Government , the private sector and academia had joined hands to respond to the increasing shortage of skilled human resources in Penang relative to the inflows of foreign and local investment in the late 1980s .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
For countries mainly indebted to private foreign creditors , a primary goal of solutions to debt-servicing crises is sustainable borrowing from international financial markets under normal terms of access .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right .  
After the disengagement phase has been successfully completed , there will be numerous complex tasks ahead in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in terms of moving forward the disarmament and demobilization of the armed groups and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
The Commission appointed Mr . Fantu Cheru as independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .  
In its economic policy , neutral Turkmenistan has proclaimed and is consistently putting into practice the open doors principle , aimed at mutually advantageous cooperation with all States , and is establishing equal conditions for the effective functioning of foreign companies in its territory , irrespective of their national origin and form of ownership .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
UNIDO also had a local role to play in helping to establish a reliable and transparent legal and economic environment conducive to direct foreign investment .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
While external financing was essential for achieving the rates of growth required to attain a marked improvement in living standards and a significant reduction of poverty in Africa , the inflow of foreign direct investment to the region was still very low , and Africa suffered from volatility in capital flows , as well as exchange rate instability and misalignment resulting from rapid liberalization of the capital account .  
It was therefore urgent that LDCs and the international community be encouraged to foster private entrepreneurship , create a domestic environment conducive to foreign investment and expand trade internally , regionally and to the world at large .  
Reaffirming the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , which implies that States also have the right to acquire arms with which to defend themselves , as well as the right of self-determination of all peoples , in particular peoples under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , and the importance of the effective realization of that right ,  
In 1975 , after enduring periods of foreign domination , colonization and neo-colonialism , his countrys multi-ethnic people had chosen a political system suited to their historical , economic , social and cultural particularities .  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
Not only are private capital flows , including foreign direct investment , increasingly concentrated in a small number of emerging markets , but also a part of such flows is too unstable to constitute a reliable source of development finance .  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
Representatives of national space agencies , foreign and defence ministries , academies of science , leading outer-space-related scientific and research centres , commercial and industrial companies , international and non-governmental outer space organizations , universities , scientific and education centres , insurance companies and banks engaged in outer-space-related activities , and also cosmonauts and astronauts have been invited to attend the forum .  
Both the new State and entity Governments have ambitious plans to further the reforms cutting tax rates and widening the tax base , improving collection of customs and excise payments and pushing forward with privatization to attract both domestic and foreign investors and to balance official budgets .  
Also express our concern in this regard that external interference , mainly linked to the exploitation of minerals and the arms trade , an unfavourable international economic environment and foreign debt , are the main contributing factors in the spread of conflicts and instability in Africa ;  
Stress the negative economic consequences of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , conscious that the economic difficulties of Africa can not be explained exclusively by foreign factors and historical events and aware that it is nevertheless a reality that those factors and events have had profound crippling effects on the economic development of Africa and that justice now requires that substantial national and international efforts be made to repair the damage ;  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights , particularly economic , social and cultural rights , to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session ( E / CN . 4 / 2001 / 56 ) , commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further ;  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,

The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
While domestic public investments have a positive role to play , in view of scarcities of domestic resources in LDCs , it will also be important to mobilize external capital , including official development assistance and foreign direct investment .  
Long-term foreign private capital flows have a complementary and catalytic role to play in building domestic supply capacity as they lead to tangible and intangible benefits , including export growth , technology and skills transfer , employment generation and poverty eradication .  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
Strongly urges States which pursued policies or practices based on racial or national superiority , such as colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation , slavery , the slave trade and ethnic cleansing , to assume their full responsibility therefor and provide prompt , adequate and fair reparation and compensation to those States , communities and individuals who were victims of such policies or practices , regardless of when they were committed ; V . STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE FULL AND EFFECTIVE EQUALITY ,  
[ Calls upon all relevant United Nations organs to endeavour to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel , together with all its racist practices , to an end , and to ensure the recognition of Jerusalem as a city of reverence and religious sanctity for the three major religions of the world which should serve as a focal point of historical and cultural inspiration , a symbol of civilization and religious dialogue and an epitome of tolerance and equality ] ;  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
For example , reference may be made to losses attributable [ to the wrongful act ] as a proximate cause , [ 168 ] or to damage which is too indirect , remote and uncertain to be appraised , [ 169 ] or to any direct loss , damage , including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources , or injury to foreign Governments , nationals and corporations as a result of the wrongful act . 
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The Ivorian patriots were just savouring that victory , so dearly yet so proudly won over the military regime , whose rule had been marked by numerous barbaric acts committed against civilian populations , when , to their great surprise , there rang out over foreign radio stations appeals by the Rassemblement des Rpublicains ( RDR ) , calling upon its militants to oppose the victory of candidate Laurent Gbagbo and thereby calling into question the presidential election of 22 October 2000 .  
There are also other factors underlying the low levels of foreign direct investment in the least advanced countries : their low productive capacity ; political factors , especially those connected with political instability in those countries ; the concomitant legal insecurity ; their landlocked situation in the case of some countries ; the high cost of transport ; the inadequacy of qualified human resources ; consumer poverty ; extremely low income levels , etc .  
While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .  
Those factors included : continued high dependence on food imports ; a direct linkage between rural agricultural viability and poverty reduction ; difficulties in balancing the short-term benefits of food aid and its long-term impact ; severe adjustment costs arising from unilateral liberalization of the agricultural sector ; non-competitiveness of agricultural exports in the world market ; and high dependence of foreign exchange earnings on exports of one or two agricultural commodity under preferential market access .  
Anti-trust-law which was aimed at preserving workable markets ( i.e . markets that were subject to workable competition obliging enterprises to meet the prices of rivals ) could aid in this process through the creation of the right conditions for the transferor and the recipient that established a balance between the interests of all parties ( in subcontracting , foreign direct investment , research and development cooperation and licensing ) , although this balance must be adjusted to the specific circumstances prevailing in individual cases .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
The Government of Panama , whose foreign policy is fully engaged in the development of the democratic system and respect for human rights throughout the world , believes that the continued exclusion of the Republic of China from the United Nations system is inconsistent with the principles that underlie the Organizations functioning , the commitment to the democratic system and human rights that the United Nations system proclaims and promotes , and the international realities witnessed by all the peoples of the world .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
In that connection , the Cypriot Government stated that it was established that remuneration and other benefits for foreign workers would be those defined for Cypriot workers by the relevant collective agreements , that the transportation costs for foreign workers from their countries of origin were borne exclusively by the employer and that special health insurance covered the foreign worker at least to the same extent as that provided by the collective agreements for Cypriot workers .  
In its foreign policy , the Democratic Republic of the Congo understands that the use of force can not settle the problems confronting the world today and that in the struggle against terrorism there is a need to create a universal conscience and a universal union that can eliminate this scourge and others that threaten the very survival of the human race .  It is for this reason that my country has signed and ratified several global conventions dealing with the question of international terrorism .  
For the global fight against poverty to be sustained following those attacks , it was crucial to : boost and better target foreign aid ; complement strong reform efforts ; reduce trade barriers ; ensure that the WTO Ministerial Conference was motivated by the desire to use trade as a tool for poverty reduction and development ; and build social consensus for ongoing reforms . 
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
To that end , he advocated examination of the root causes , as well as the symptoms , of the planets economic and social ills , which included under-development , poverty , illiteracy , unemployment , prolonged foreign occupations , debilitating conditionalities and inequitable trading patterns , all of which called for resolute national and international actions .  
A worldwide campaign of solidarity was needed to meet all those growing challenges with a view to strengthening international cooperation and transparency based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , and of international law , namely , equality among States , non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , the right of peoples to self-defence , to self-determination and to oppose foreign occupation , and respect for cultural diversity and diversity of beliefs .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
They had been asked to establish an environment conducive to capital flows , yet foreign direct investment flows to the developing countries were continually shrinking and were expected to diminish by another 6 per cent in 2001 , especially since the climate in the developed countries was more uncertain , the risks were greater and investment returns were lower . 
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
For that purpose , alliances have to be promoted between domestic and foreign enterprises of all sizes for the supply of services nationally and internationally ; a network of national and international companies supplying core and related energy services should be established ; and the energy strategy must be supported by Venezuelas active participation in the multilateral trade negotiation forums .  
The future convention should deal with the active and passive corruption of national and foreign public officials and provide for the liability of natural and legal persons .  
The experts noted that the provision of adequate , affordable energy is essential for eradicating poverty , improving human welfare and raising living standards worldwide , and is a precondition for industrial development and for attracting foreign investment .  
The context can not be viewed in isolation ; we must also consider the various related factors , such as the costly structural adjustments that we have been making to our economies in accordance with international financial requirements , the heavy foreign debt burden and the unequal conditions that persist in world trade , which have limited our steady development .  
Further recognizing the need for African countries to continue their efforts to create a climate favourable to private sector development and foreign direct investment and also the commitment of African countries to using both human and financial resources more efficiently in the process of industrialization , and emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic initiatives and international support , inter alia , through enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt relief , as appropriate , and enhanced market access ,

As determined by the Panel in its previous reports , claims for funds held in Iraqi bank accounts are compensable if , prior to Iraqs invasion and occupation of Kuwait , the claimant had a reasonable expectation that it could transfer the funds outside Iraq , but such claims are not compensable if the funds were not exchangeable for foreign currency . 
This has been achieved by making the relevant amendments to the Access to space action area by the appropriate means and mechanisms , in conformity with the current national and global technological situation and in line with Argentinas foreign policy , its non-proliferation policy and the international undertakings assumed by Argentina in that connection , and by encouraging a gradual and continuous increase in the countrys intellectual and technological participation .  
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .  
The view was expressed that , in considering whether national or international air law was applicable to an aerospace object while it was in the airspace of another State , delegations should distinguish between objects passing through the airspace of foreign States for the sole purpose of entering or leaving outer space and those objects which would be capable of manoeuvring in and out of airspace and outer space .  
Strengthening the enabling environment for private sector development and foreign investment flows ; of particular importance is a supportive regulatory and legal framework for new and existing FDI along with the necessary institutional infrastructure and capacity to implement and maintain it ;  
To develop policies and action plans , and to reinforce and implement preventive measures , to foster greater harmony and tolerance between migrant workers and host societies with the aim of eliminating the growing manifestations of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including acts of violence , perpetrated in many societies by individuals or groups and directed towards migrant workers and their families , persons of migrant origin and resident foreign workers ;
