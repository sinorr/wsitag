As such , we should bring into full play our present and potential comparative advantages .  Among our existing industries , we should find out which are relatively competitive in the international market and should be developed on a priority basis , which have potential competitiveness and should be well-cultivated , and which can hardly become competitive in the foreseeable future and should be " given up immediately . "  This way , we will be able to " advance in some areas and retreat in others " when making the structural adjustment .

There are things they should engage in , and things they should n't .  Namely , they should pull out of those competitive areas which are not suited to SOE development , while those SOEs which it is necessary to retain should achieve the diversification of entities investing in them through the form of joint-stock companies , establishing a modern enterprise system and improving their economic management .

Taiwan has graduated from the labor intensive , living-room factory economy to the sophisticated economy of capital intensive industries , computer components and massive investment in R &amp; D . Industry and government realized that in order to maintain profit margins in this new and highly competitive environment , Management Science would have to assume a greater role in directing the development of Taiwan 's economic future .  
Below the stage stand a crowd of older people , chewing on betel nuts . These patrons of puppet theatre are joined by the four puppet troupes left in Taiwan , who abandon their traditional competitive stance to come together and view the play . Professors and others concerned about the future of folk art as well as reporters and photographers with flash cameras are on the scene .

With English as its official language , obviating the need to learn another foreign language , along with its relative proximity to Taiwan , its similarity in climate and its spacious and comfortable living environment , Australia makes for a highly competitive choice .  
Comparing the graceful architecture of Quanzhou 's Empress of Heaven Temple , with its mix of Song style and Ming structure , to the entirely new constructions of Meizhou 's temple complex , Huang Bingyan calls attention to the fact that the Mother Temple was still able to be appointed as a major province-level protected historic site , and with a tone of competitive spite , he adds , " That 's just for raising the status of the Mother Temple .  
We want to guide the new generation to understand their homeland , love their country and develop a broad international perspective . Thus fortified , they can better meet international challenges and map out a bright future for their country in an increasingly competitive global village .  
Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
These figures suggest citizens ' ability to separate the individual from the issue at stake and to be both hard-headed and sympathetic . This again reminds us that freedom and democracy are our most precious assets , and that open debate creates an informed electorate . We look forward to the people nudging the government and society to be ever-more efficient and competitive .  
In The Competitive Advantage of Nations , published in 1990 , Porter advanced the now famous " Porter 's Diamond , " a four-sided framework in which the vague concept of competitive advantage is turned into something clear and concrete . From organizations as small as a single company to those as large as a nation , the basic forces at work in shaping competitive advantage are herein clearly exposed .  
Porter pointed out that previous ideas about national power and competitive advantage focused on countries with vast territory and abundant natural resources , which ideally were backed up by military strength .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
A new 42-move form was established for the Asian Games , with contestants being judged on their facility in the form , including points such as whether a leg is raised high enough or if movements performed from a low squat are executed with sufficient power . The competitive element has attracted many young people to taijiquan , but has also provoked controversy within martial arts circles .  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
The level of education soared , and a total of 43 candidates from Kinmen eventually passed the extremely competitive imperial examinations over the years . The military period began after the Mongols put an end to the Song dynasty in 1279 . Loyal Song subjects unwilling to submit to Mongol rule retreated to Kinmen . Four centuries later , after the Ming dynasty was conquered by Manchus from the north , Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) used Kinmen as a base in his attempt to restore Ming rule .  
At first merely quantitative , change has now become qualitative . Finally , in the course of a truly competitive presidential election , we broke through the idea of " Asian values " that has been manufactured out of ignorance and to serve vested interests . We shattered the assumption that Chinese people are only suited to being ruled by authoritarian regimes and can not have democracy or rule of law .  
We decided to devote our special feature this month to the investments of Taiwanese businesses in mainland China , with which Taiwan has enjoyed annual trade surpluses of well over US $ 20 billion in recent years . We focus especially on the question of why Taiwanese high-tech manufacturers are moving offshore , and how they manage to keep afloat in the fiercely competitive market of the greater Shanghai region .  
Pingtung County Councilor Lin Yu-hung has raised the issue before the county council , stating : " Taiwan 's pending entry into the World Trade Organization will have a tremendous impact on traditional industries . The Pingtung County Government must promote the use of more advanced farming techniques and consider how to make local farmers more competitive . "  
However , the creation of a happier learning environment in elementary school is now running up against the hard reality of regular examinations and competitive pressures to advance in junior high school , which still operates along more traditional lines .  
Revenues from kaoliang have always been critical to Kinmen 's economy , and , to meet market demand , in 1997 a second plant was built at the Kinmen distillery . Current products include premium kaoliang ( commonly called baijinlong ) , aged kaoliang , low-alcohol kaoliang , damian liquor , and various medicinal and commemorative brews . All are highly competitive in the marketplace .  
On the first day of TIBE President Chen Shui-bian delivered remarks at the opening ceremonies . In addition to welcoming the publishing professionals from the various countries , he emphasized that a global knowledge-based economy was now in full swing , that the creation and utilization of knowledge would be the key to competitive failure or success for countries and industries . He said the government would incorporate the " knowledge industry " into the national guiding objectives and that the publishing industry was the foundation of the knowledge industry .  
Sinorama has many times reported on the government 's intention to develop a " knowledge-based economy " and to foster the development of the so-called " twin star " industries-digital content and biotechnology . But relative to other countries , do these fields offer Taiwan the competitive advantage that a successful business strategy requires ?  
In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
This has been especially noteworthy since the former state-run telephone company became Chung Hwa Telecom and began operating as a private enterprise , driving competition in the broadband Internet access market . This market has become very competitive , with operators offering special deals and unlimited access , thereby greatly contributing to the increase in e-commerce activity .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
In this increasingly competitive era , instrumental values like drive , ability to work independently , and professional knowledge are given the greatest weight by society . The media and publishing industry have been warning young people to get themselves geared up for the economic struggles ahead . But amidst all the talk of instrumental values , you have to wonder : Whatever happened to dreams , those things that make life so exciting and worthwhile ?  
Classical studies in kindergartens has become more fashionable , but in the mainland the educational environment is fiercely competitive . Even getting into a good elementary school entails being tested and paying bribes under the table , so the pressure to advance is felt right down to the toddlers graduating from these kindergartens , and it can impinge seriously on their classical studies time .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
Mining and investment institutions are attracted to jurisdictions where the rules are simple and complete , the bureaucracy is efficient , mineral tenure is secure , and the general positioning of the mineral resource is competitive on a worldwide scale .

We are aware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a region , but there is no alternative to this path of collective self-reliance if our region is to survive in the current competitive international economic environment .  
To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and , at the same time , to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural , social , economic and political reality .  
Unless management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest calibre , from anywhere in the world and this can be done only if remuneration is internationally competitive and if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection process it will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve the continuous improvement in quality and efficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of United Nations organizations .  
Our Government is fully convinced that if we are to enjoy sustained medium - and long-term growth it must be based on an efficient and competitive productive sector , both domestically and internationally , and to that end we have adopted the requisite economic policy measures .  
National approaches to managing cultural diversity which nurtured the rich culture and linguistic traditions inherent in diverse communities would enhance the competitive position of national economies and increase international peace and security .  
However , in an increasingly competitive world economy , in which the weak position of African countries is tantamount to marginalization , there is an urgent need to re-examine the importance of cooperation and focus more on those critical facets of Africa 's development in the context of the present and future political and social and economic environment of the continent .  
African countries , in particular , required more imaginative long-term solutions to overcome their competitive disadvantage deriving from dependency on primary exports , a weak industrial and export base and technological backwardness .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
They noted the general satisfaction expressed by the Inspectors with competitive recruitment examinations , but wished to seek clarification from them regarding the apparent contradiction in paragraphs 65 , 67 , 78 and 79 of the report , which stated , on the one hand , that the quality of staff members recruited through examinations had improved and , on the other , that the general level of candidates was rather low .  
Recalling that a reappraisal of the 1921 principle , on which common system remuneration is based , was long overdue , ACC reiterated its concern that the current remuneration system was outdated and needed to be overhauled to become competitive with bilateral and other multilateral financial and aid agencies . 
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
An innovative form of cooperation which seems to have been implemented most successfully in the Asian and Pacific region is the creation of " subregional growth zones " , where surplus capital from relatively developed economies in the region complements surplus skilled labour in neighbouring economies to generate production of exportable products at competitive prices .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
The principal goal pursued by the Government with regard to the economy and society for the period from 1995 to 1999 is that of promoting the creation of an internationally competitive economic structure that assures a sustained rate of growth ; supported by solid policies of employment and income generation that would permit a progressive improvement in the well-being of the population .  
The Commission had concluded from a reappraisal of the principle and its application that the Noblemaire principle continued to be applicable and that the " best-paid national civil service " formula , combined with a reference check with international organizations , appeared to be sound , provided that the process was handled in a timely manner and the margin range realistically reflected comparator expatriation benefits and resulted in a competitive remuneration package .  
In the context of globalization and integration in which our countries are evolving , Governments are bound to assume a much more active role in helping to create efficient and competitive environments in our economies , thus enabling us to improve the standards of living of our peoples and contributing to the resolute head-on fight against corruption and impunity at the national and international levels . 
Today in my country , reform of the public administration system is being carried out in the following ways : the adoption of economic means of stimulating production and business activities ; the restructuring of the national economic sector , with emphasis on leading edge and high technology sectors ; reform of the banking sector ; the creation of conditions for stimulating long-term capital investment and for attracting direct foreign investment to modernize industrial enterprises and to create competitive new market structures ; reform of the system of social protection for citizens ; and so on .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Examples of this trend are the free elections that have been held in recent years elections that were open , competitive and fair ; the respect for existing legislation ; the creation of constitutional courts and the appointment of special prosecutors for human rights ; the existence of independent electoral tribunals and multi-party parliaments ; the promotion of autonomous and efficient judicial systems and the development of programmes to promote a culture of peace and democracy .

The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
In the light of the General Assembly resolution , the Secretary-General decided that the arrangement be evaluated and a worldwide competitive bidding be conducted to identify one or more advisers to provide to the Investment Management Service , research , macro / microeconomic analyses , securities , market and sector analyses ( global and regional ) .  
" Recognizing that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
" In the period ahead , it appears increasingly important that there should be simultaneous movements on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire Principle .  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Those measures included the introduction of a human resources management planning function which would enable the Secretariat to project staff needs and design training to meet those needs ; the introduction of performance management through the Performance Appraisal System ; the introduction of people management training designed to enable managers and supervisors to have a better understanding of and to take responsibility for the staff entrusted to them ; and the initial development of a management assignment programme for P-2 and P-3 staff recruited through the national competitive examination process .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Direct negotiations are sometimes allowed under exceptional circumstances , such as when for special reasons competitive methods would not lead to satisfactory results , or in the case of projects with an anticipated initial investment value not exceeding a certain amount or of a limited duration .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
As shown in the upper right-hand box of figure 3 , if the rules of the game , including intellectual property rights , standards and tariffs for access to global networks , are put in place for the GII on a highly cooperative basis , and if competitive forces are strong , then a balanced environment of competition and cooperation among ICT companies will emerge .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
Concern about slack growth and mounting social problems led the Government to decide early in March on a new economic orientation , including promotion of investment and elimination of all obstacles to investment by Lebanese and foreigners ; protection of agriculture through limiting imports of competing agricultural products ; and selection and protection of competitive industries , which have an export potential , which will be supported to ensure increased productivity .  
Additional complementary programmes , designed and implemented in the past 18 months , include training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution , special development programmes for successful G to P and national competitive entry candidates , supervisory skills training for senior General Service and Junior Professionals with supervisory responsibilities and a programme on General Service effectiveness .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
The training of translators after they have joined Conference Services should certainly not be understood in the academic sense : all translators are recruited through a highly selective competitive examination restricted to university graduates , which is a guarantee of solid professional qualifications .  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
The nature of this relationship should be clarified , as , in his view , the social effects of immigration will depend on whether the labour supplied by immigrants is perceived as competitive with or complementary to native labour and there is no satisfactory measure for determining whether racism has increased or decreased .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;

In a statement submitted to the General Assembly in 1996 ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 25 and Corr . 1 , annex ) ACC stressed the importance of there being simultaneous movement on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire principle . 
However , in countries where objectively justifiable reforms have been marred by cronyism and nepotism and undertaken without a concomitant commitment to justice , solid money , competitive markets and democracy , the result has been unbridled mercantilism , with the vast majority of the population being denied the opportunities and benefits of economic growth .  
This was done for practical reasons , including a desire to allow the Ministry a high degree of flexibility in securing numerous and diverse offers from a variety of sources , at competitive prices and on the customary commercial terms , and in order to avoid being restricted to a single brand name under which all our requirements for a particular item might not be available within the period the Memorandum of Understanding is in effect .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .

If CWHKT 's basic rental charge remains substantially below cost , which will still be slightly below cost after the increase , other local operators , whose costs are comparable to CWHKT 's , will find it difficult to offer competitive alternative services to the residential market without suffering a loss .

In step with the global trend to open up the television market , we consider that the Government 's role should be to create an open and competitive market to promote the development of the broadcasting industry .  The Government should , as far as possible , refrain from intervening in the market , such as imposing mandatory requirements on domestic pay television programme service licensees to provide a channel to broadcast the programmes produced by the RTHK or the cultural presentations organized by the LCSD .  
The spokesman also said the Government was committed to working with the industry to facilitate the development of a healthy and reliable construction industry .

Below the stage stand a crowd of older people , chewing on betel nuts . These patrons of puppet theatre are joined by the four puppet troupes left in Taiwan , who abandon their traditional competitive stance to come together and view the play . Professors and others concerned about the future of folk art as well as reporters and photographers with flash cameras are on the scene .  
The " superstar " art objects that go for astronomical prices are almost all the focus of intense promotion by auction houses intended to stir up a competitive psychology among buyers .

Even as the NA experiences the growing pains of competitive politics , the era of rule by the Chiang family has been receding farther back into memory . Recently Chiang Wei-kuo proposed moving the temporary graves of the two Chiang presidents ( Kai-shek and Ching-kuo ) to mainland China . This proposal launched the Chiang family back into the public eye and sparked turbulence on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year .

The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects .

In fact , globalization and the WTO , built on a foundation of market competition and accumulation of capital , coupled with an increasingly specialized division of labor within hi-tech industries , have caught many developed nations off guard , leaving those unprepared for globalization ostracized from the global economy . The third world , despite its competitive labor costs , possesses an even greater number of people susceptible to marginalization . Unable to ride the wave of globalization , they will become a global underclass .  
The public was encouraged during the Ming dynasty to practice martial arts , and people were intensely competitive about it . Ming dynasty metal workers were the first in the world to use coke and piston bellows in swordmaking , and they developed a number of advanced steelmaking techniques that led to the production of outstanding sabers and swords .  
Like many Taiwanese agricultural towns , Kungkuan has an excellent natural endowment but has struggled to remain competitive and has lost many of its young people to jobs in urban areas . Agriculture and the once vigorous ceramics industry have been greatly weakened .  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices .

In this increasingly competitive era , instrumental values like drive , ability to work independently , and professional knowledge are given the greatest weight by society .

These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide .

The only viable long-term solution to the twin issues of unemployment and poverty lies in the building up of competitive productive capacities that can generate production and incomes among the population at large , a process in which industry is not the sole contributor .  However , all historical evidence suggest that industry plays a pivotal role in advancing technology , increasing productivity , nurturing entrepreneurship and generating a broad range of critical skills , all of which converge to increase a country 's standard of living .  
In the light of the General Assembly resolution , the Secretary-General decided that the arrangement be evaluated and a worldwide competitive bidding be conducted to identify one or more advisers to provide to the Investment Management Service , research , macro / microeconomic analyses , securities , market and sector analyses ( global and regional ) .  
" Recognizing that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
" In the period ahead , it appears increasingly important that there should be simultaneous movements on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire Principle .  
" Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,

Those measures included the introduction of a human resources management planning function which would enable the Secretariat to project staff needs and design training to meet those needs ; the introduction of performance management through the Performance Appraisal System ; the introduction of people management training designed to enable managers and supervisors to have a better understanding of and to take responsibility for the staff entrusted to them ; and the initial development of a management assignment programme for P-2 and P-3 staff recruited through the national competitive examination process .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Direct negotiations are sometimes allowed under exceptional circumstances , such as when for special reasons competitive methods would not lead to satisfactory results , or in the case of projects with an anticipated initial investment value not exceeding a certain amount or of a limited duration .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
The key elements are : ( a ) the creation of an effective and professional human resource management organization ; ( b ) implementation of human resource measures sensitive to a more equitable gender-balance in decision-making ; ( c ) increased efficiency of transaction-based services ; ( d ) maintenance of competitive benefits and conditions of service ; ( e ) foundations for continuous learning and learning opportunities for key staff .  
As shown in the upper right-hand box of figure 3 , if the rules of the game , including intellectual property rights , standards and tariffs for access to global networks , are put in place for the GII on a highly cooperative basis , and if competitive forces are strong , then a balanced environment of competition and cooperation among ICT companies will emerge .  
In contrast , if there is a low level of cooperation in the establishment of the rules of the game , and if competitive forces are weak , then national governments may be more likely to adopt a relatively passive stance , which is characteristic of the Cargo Cult scenario .  
This is both a theoretical and political challenge as these rights were formulated in a context that was totally different economically and above all politically : the post-war period , the cold war , the existence of a socialist bloc and of competitive capitalism based on strong nation states .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
Concern about slack growth and mounting social problems led the Government to decide early in March on a new economic orientation , including promotion of investment and elimination of all obstacles to investment by Lebanese and foreigners ; protection of agriculture through limiting imports of competing agricultural products ; and selection and protection of competitive industries , which have an export potential , which will be supported to ensure increased productivity .  
Additional complementary programmes , designed and implemented in the past 18 months , include training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution , special development programmes for successful G to P and national competitive entry candidates , supervisory skills training for senior General Service and Junior Professionals with supervisory responsibilities and a programme on General Service effectiveness .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
It is becoming difficult for a single firm to muster all the resources required to be innovative and competitive in the global markets , and firms are therefore aligning themselves with others , including competitors , with complementary capabilities or resources . 
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
While there was no simple solution to pursuing development goals in an increasingly competitive and globalized world and even though economic growth was not automatic , notable strides had been made by those who embraced credible macro-economic settings ; those who addressed the social dimension of development in tandem with the pursuit of economic growth ; those who fostered domestic private sector development ; and those who pursued representative , open and accountable governance .  
The training of translators after they have joined Conference Services should certainly not be understood in the academic sense : all translators are recruited through a highly selective competitive examination restricted to university graduates , which is a guarantee of solid professional qualifications .  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
The nature of this relationship should be clarified , as , in his view , the social effects of immigration will depend on whether the labour supplied by immigrants is perceived as competitive with or complementary to native labour and there is no satisfactory measure for determining whether racism has increased or decreased .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
Such activity , while disrupting existing economic routines - - and the associated firms , practices and factors of production - - will improve the competitive position of the firm or the broader productive unit in which it is introduced by creating new markets , advancing the technological regime or establishing new linkages between product producers ( suppliers ) and users .  As such , innovation is a permanent feature of economic development .  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue to hold national competitive examinations for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels as a useful tool for selecting the best qualified candidates from inadequately represented Member States ; special attention should be paid to the prospects of staff for promotion to the P-3 level and to the need to conduct such examinations with maximum efficiency and economy ;  
Requests the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations organizations and programmes to ensure selection of consultants on a more competitive basis and to keep the instances of recourse to sole candidates to a strict minimum , each such case being formally approved at an appropriate level of authority , on an exceptional basis , prior to engagement ;

In a statement submitted to the General Assembly in 1996 ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 25 and Corr . 1 , annex ) ACC stressed the importance of there being simultaneous movement on two fronts : the active , continuing pursuit of efficiency , enhanced performance , including managerial performance , and structural and management reform ; and an equally active pursuit by ICSC of the measures required to restore competitive conditions of service through the rebuilding of the Noblemaire principle . 
However , in countries where objectively justifiable reforms have been marred by cronyism and nepotism and undertaken without a concomitant commitment to justice , solid money , competitive markets and democracy , the result has been unbridled mercantilism , with the vast majority of the population being denied the opportunities and benefits of economic growth .  
This was done for practical reasons , including a desire to allow the Ministry a high degree of flexibility in securing numerous and diverse offers from a variety of sources , at competitive prices and on the customary commercial terms , and in order to avoid being restricted to a single brand name under which all our requirements for a particular item might not be available within the period the Memorandum of Understanding is in effect .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
To begin with , as international firms begin to operate in the world economy as if it were a single market and production space , the issue of competitive markets is now being posed in terms of the " contestability " of markets , i.e . not only actual trade competition in goods and services , but also potential competition resulting from the establishment of foreign firms through direct investment .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
The project focuses on the nature of the private investment decisions of southern European manufacturing firms required to incorporate technological change in the transition to sustained and competitive growth in the single European market .  
A stable macroeconomic environment when accompanied by low inflation , competitive exchange rates , manageable public debt , democratic institutions and principles of good governance was conducive to increased domestic and foreign investment .  
It also emphasized the need to introduce a wide range of policy , legal , regulatory and institutional reforms which would provide the private sector with a more favourable and competitive business environment .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
The creation of the necessary social and economic conditions for free basic , vocational and , on the basis of competitive access , complete secondary and higher education at State educational establishments within the limits of State educational standards ;  
At international level , our country is due to sign the Patent Cooperation Treaty , although alternative measures do exist to avoid the abuse of patents as well as monopolistic and anti _ competitive commercial practices on the part of patent inventors .  
Another important group of migrants who are exposed to serious human rights abuses are those engaged in the informal economy of the receiving countries , where small and less competitive enterprises , especially in textile , garment-making and various service industries , try to save on social and labour costs by hiring cheap and often irregular migrant workers , increasingly with the help of traffickers .  
UNIDO harnesses the joint forces of government and the private sector to foster competitive industrial production , develop international industrial partnerships and promote socially equitable and environmentally friendly industrial development .  UNIDO is the only worldwide organization dealing with industry from a development perspective .  
Furthermore , pending the revision of paragraphs ( f ) and ( g ) of financial rule 110.19 as called for in General Assembly resolution 52 / 226 , paragraph 18 , he had issued a memorandum in April 1998 to ensure that the procurement of professional supplies , medicines , medical supplies , hospital or surgical supplies and prosthetic appliances were no longer exempt from competitive bidding .  
Requests the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination of the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments ;  
For many transition economies , the scale of restructuring required by the shift from central planning to competitive markets is so large that the domestic economic , political and social institutions , which are also in a state of transition , are unable to cope with the adjustment costs , which in turn may generate large-scale resistance to reform ( the study of Romania in the current Survey provides a telling example of this ) .  
In view of the fact that these areas were subject to a slower form of deterioration , it was determined that , rather than add them to the existing garage project , the areas ( north end 2B ) should be designed and bid as a separate project and the benefit of further competitive bidding gained ; ( iv ) Library faade ( $ 250,000 ) .  
Requests the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination of the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in the further enhancement of the career development system of the Organization , to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels ;  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
In this way national participation in the most advanced scientific activities can be assured and nationals of developing countries can become an active and integral part of the important group of internationally recognized and competitive associations of researchers in many fields .  
A steering committee , comprised mainly of human resource specialists drawn from several organizations of the United Nations system , supervised the pilot , which was conducted , in close consultation with UNDG and CCPOQ , by a specialized firm selected on the basis of competitive bidding . 
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
The Council calls on the international community to support broad _ based trade liberalization and to address in the next round of multilateral negotiations all the pertinent issues which can hinder the ability of African economies to be more competitive .  
The economic benefits of privatization consisted of improving enterprise efficiency and performance ; developing competitive industry ; accessing capital , know-how and markets ; achieving effective corporate governance ; developing well _ functioning capital markets ; and securing an optional sale price .  
The development of a competitive industry generating productive employment within a healthy environment was the best possible bulwark against poverty and the best means of creating an economically sound global society with minimal risks of economic and social conflict .  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
By section V , paragraph 22 , of its resolution 53 / 221 of 7 April 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments .  
In resolution 53 / 221 , the Secretary-General is requested to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels .

Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
The precarious socio-economic situation in the least developed countries and the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies continue unabated and relegated these countries to a weak competitive position in the current global economic setting .  
The region can no longer rely on cheap labour or raw materials for its structural transformation but rather must shift to improving the productivity of its labour , effectively transforming its static comparative advantages to dynamic competitive advantages .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
The precarious socio-economic situation of LDCs , the structural weaknesses inherent in their economies and the adverse external environment they faced relegated those countries to a weak competitive position .  
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .  
And , insofar as a game is not only about fair rules but also about competitive players , it is essential to reconsider the existing provisions of the unequal agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPs ) , which was signed at a time when most Governments and most people did not understand its economic implications .  
The wave of economic and corporate restructurings undertaken to respond to an increasingly competitive global market and the widespread dismantling of social security systems have resulted in unemployment , work insecurity and worsening labour conditions giving rise to violations of core economic and social rights set forth in articles 6 to 9 of the Covenant .  
Their activities were legitimate , competitive and regulated ; they were not dissimilar from those of developed countries that encouraged foreign direct investment .  
These include free , fair and competitive elections ; separation of powers ; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; strengthening the rule of law and the application of practices of good governance and fundamental freedoms ; increasing the participation of civil society in the development of democracy ; creating an economic environment favourable to democracy ; and enhancing social cohesion and solidarity , among others . 
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
Requests the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination of the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary arrangements ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in the further enhancement of the Organizations career development system , to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels ;  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
It has to maintain a scientific community of the highest standard , promote a competitive space industry by maximizing its innovative potential and meet the growing needs of an increasing number of users of outer space .  
In an open system , national competitive economic purpose can sustain a pool of highly educated and flexible workers , an efficient infrastructure , sound money and a good quality of life so as to attract mobile financial and human capital .  
While the quality of the BtoC relationship is crucial , it is unattainable without a fully developed BtoB network as only through this can the online player offer a complete , complex and competitive product .  
The three Es competitive economy , sound environment and productive employmentare not isolated targets , but interrelated parts that require a combined approach to achieve sustainable industrial development .  
Clearly , the active and growing participation of the developing countries in trade flows required a competitive economy at the national level , but also a favourable international environment .  
So it is also dependent on increasing resources over time , by making the most efficient use of the existing resources through proper fiscal , monetary , trade and competitive market practices , and by promoting the growth of resources and expanding the opportunities for trade .  
In the area of information management , priority is attached to completing the implementation of a global information system on human resources , including an automated system of collecting and processing vital data on staff members and applicants with a view to facilitating related processes with respect to filling vacancies with internal and external candidates , including those from the national competitive examinations .  
Regrets that despite section V , paragraph 19 , of its resolution 53 / 221 and according to paragraph 52 of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat on the follow-up audit of the recruitment process in the Office of Human Resources Management , [ 5 ] some programme managers are still reluctant to recruit candidates selected through national competitive examinations , leaving many P-2 posts vacant , and requests the Secretary-General to take concrete measures to fill those posts expeditiously from the existing roster of successful candidates ;  
Regrets that despite section V , paragraph 19 , of its resolution 53 / 221 and according to paragraph 52 of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat on the follow-up audit of the recruitment process in the Office of Human Resources Management , [ 5 ] some programme managers are still reluctant to recruit candidates selected through national competitive examinations , leaving many P-2 posts vacant , and requests the Secretary-General to take concrete measures to fill those posts expeditiously from the existing roster of successful candidates ;  
The practice is nevertheless being continued ; for example , a competitive examination for English interpreters capable of working from Russian is planned for early 2002 for the candidates being trained in-house in the autumn as well as for other applicants ; an examination for English translators capable of translating from Arabic will be given in February 2002 , and a similar examination for French translators may also be held in 2002 if the competitive examination scheduled for September 2001 does not produce a significant number of successful candidates proficient in Arabic .  
Under this arrangement , candidates who have taken the test who are not proficient enough to be included in the roster of contractual translators but show good potential may be recruited as entry-level freelances for short periods during which , while doing regular translation work under close supervision , they undergo intensive on-the-job training aimed at increasing their chances of success in a forthcoming competitive examination . 
Because of the many obstacles that developing landlocked countries faced in international trade , especially high transport costs which made their exports expensive and less competitive , special attention should be given to the interests of those countries in the next round of trade negotiations .  
In the social sphere , bridges should be built not only to improve education and train people to live together in a highly competitive world , but to ensure peaceful coexistence based on tolerance , respect and solidarity , as well as strengthening national and international institutions to ensure the changes needed for new commitments .  
Under this arrangement , candidates who are not proficient enough to be included in the roster of contractual translators but who show good potential are recruited as entry-level freelances for short periods , during which , while doing regular translation work under close supervision , they undergo intensive on-the-job training , thereby increasing their chances of success in a forthcoming competitive examination . 
Unlike the industrial age , which had been structured around vertically integrated organizations with high costs of communications , information and transportation , the age of networking was structured around horizontal networks , with each organization focusing on competitive niches in order to obtain maximum political economic and financial advantage by making the right decisions at the right time . 
At the same time , however , there was an increased awareness of the potentially adverse consequences of economic liberalization : faced with stronger competitive pressures , a firm would be faced with the dilemma of either undertaking risky investments to upgrade its product lines and process technologies or shifting towards more commodity-like , lower value-added , productsif it was to stay in business at all .  
Recognizing that the main role of UNIDO lies in providing technical cooperation to the developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition , in relation to those support functions in which the Organization has a competitive advantage , such as strengthening of industrial capacities and cleaner sustainable industrial development and also giving assistance to those countries to participate effectively in international trade ,
