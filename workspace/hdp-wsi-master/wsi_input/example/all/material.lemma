The members of Jingyang County 's leading group said : In the past , we always thought economic work meant inflexible tasks and targets while the party building and the building of spiritual civilization were flexible tasks , dealing with ideological work , not " grain production . "  So , we did not have a profound understanding of the principle of " building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both " and our understanding of it was lopsided .  
Once we have advanced productive forces and an advanced social system , we can create more and better material and spiritual wealth ; can get a firm foothold , and can march at the head in our competition with different countries and different forces ; and can develop greater power to enhance the comprehensive national strength of our country .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .

At the same time when we uphold economic construction as the central task , we must also make earnest efforts to step up the building of a socialist spiritual civilization ; and must bring about a comprehensive progress to both the material productive forces of our society and the ideology , ethics , and culture of our society .  The position of economic construction as a central task should remain unshaken at all times ;  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
If our military 's writers and artists can achieve these , they can obtain the rich source material contained in various new and typical aspects of society , reflect the real spirit of the times accurately and in a lively manner , and create highly concise , perfect and successful works with clear characteristics of the times .

Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
With reference to the new developments in situations at home and abroad , the new developments in productive forces and the new situations occurring in economic structural reform , the new requirements of the masses of people for their material and cultural life , and the new changes taking place within the contingents of party members and cadres under the new situation , we must earnestly study , deeply understand , and wholly and accurately master the spiritual essence of this important thinking .

Only Marxism discovered for the first time the law of development of human society , namely existence decides consciousness , material production decides spiritual production , economic foundation decides super structure , the relations between productive force and production and the contradictions between economic foundation and superstructure push social progress .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .

The Commercial Press has developed a CD-ROM of the " Ci Yuan " , but they still do not dare to take it out for fear of piracy .  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
Focusing on and serving this center of economic construction , constantly strengthening and improving the ideological and political work and the building of spiritual civilization to fully display its role of clearing up doubts , remove apprehensions , and inspire spirit can vigorously safeguard and promote the building and development of the socialist material civilization .

Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .  
It was an important material foundation for economic growth , technological progress , and social stability in the developed countries after World War II , where lay the crucial reason for the economic backwardness and social poverty of developing countries .  
China 's overall national strength has been greatly increased , and the people 's material and cultural life enhanced .  China has also greatly raised its international status .

In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .

Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .

The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;

In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
The successful practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the liveliest and most convincing teaching material , and the various advanced individuals who emerged from among us and their advanced and typical deeds are the liveliest and most current and brilliant teaching materials .  We must carry out education in ideals and conviction with perfect assurance and push ahead socialist civilization building unwaveringly .  
The leadership collective of the third generation of the party with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has all the more attached importance to and strengthened the building of socialist spiritual civilization , made continuous new advances in this aspect while persisting in taking economic construction as the center and paying close attention to the building of material civilization , and clearly and definitely set and gradually and systematically expounded the task of building a culture with Chinese characteristics .  
In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .

When touching on utilizing domestic and international resources and on striving to tap domestic and international markets , Wu Yi emphasized the need for localities to encourage , promote , and assist potential and outstanding enterprises to invest in and operate plants abroad , and to engage in product assembling and in raw material processing .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
Jiang Zemin viewed with great interest the materials , parts , components , and mechanical and electrical products turned out by the machine-building , metallurgical , nonferrous , petrochemical , light , textile and building material industries , the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Ministry of Education , and other departments , listened to briefings by scientific research personnel , and asked in detail about some of the production and technical problems .

Labor models and advanced workers are the outstanding representatives of China 's working class and millions upon millions of the laboring masses .  They are the vanguards of the building of material and spiritual civilization .  Their advanced thinking and exemplary deeds fully manifest the lofty style and spirit of China 's working class .  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
Summing up experiences of the past few years , the reason why we have been able to withstand the tests in the face of huge difficulties and have also grasped the momentum and achieved outstanding success is , first of all , because the active and steady progress of the reforms and opening up of the past 20 years , the rapid development of the national economy , and the marked increase in comprehensive national strength have laid a relatively sound material and technical foundation for withstanding and resisting dangers .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : All the work of the party and the state is for the fundamental purpose of satisfying the people 's daily increasing needs in their material and cultural life and improving their living standards .  
In order to realize the grand goal of modernization , solve contradictions and problems in economic and social life and satisfy the increasing material and cultural needs of the broad masses of people , we must maintain a relatively fast speed in development .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .

Although the Chinese government insists that the Taiwan question brooks no intervention and has taken retaliatory action against European countries that sold advanced arms to Taiwan with satisfactory results , it is reluctant to take action to stop the United States from overtly calling for the maintenance of the status quo while covertly supporting " Taiwan independence , " because it is aware of its substantial gap with the United States in economic and military strength and has to take care of its economic development and improve the material life of its people .  
China will greatly promote the strategic readjustment of its economic structure , accelerate the computerization of the national economic and social sectors , greatly develop science , education , and cultural undertakings , step up developing such new and high technologies like information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , and advanced manufacturing technology , further step up infrastructure building in water conservancy , communications , and energy , and intensify efforts on ecological building and environmental protection .

The authorities have confirmed from both the human testimony and material evidence available that Li Jizhou is a suspect who has taken a huge amount of bribes by abusing his power through shielding smuggling ; issuing licenses to smuggled vehicles ;  
During his period in office in Guangxi , as a high-ranking cadre , he used the advantages afforded by his powers to pursue private interests and illegally received huge amounts of money and material from others ; the case was particularly bad and seriously infringed on the honesty of state work personnel 's duties , and ruined the reputation of the party and government ; he is a typical corrupt element .

At this critical juncture , when China is moving from the 20th century toward the 21st century , we must make material progress and cultural and ideological progress a uniform goal to strive for , unfailingly insisting on concentrating on both aspects .  We must put comprehensive social development in a strategic position , achieving the mutually-coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society .  
For example , people may have strong material desires , may pursue money fetishism and hedonism , may become hasty in unscrupulously seeking instant successes and gains , may become vulgar and fall short of lofty ideals and beliefs , may become hypocritical and fall short of sound personality , may act in a double-dealing way , and may even behave in a disorderly way without regard to law and order .  
The most fundamental experience in achieving tremendous successes in reform and opening up in the past 20 years and more is that at all time and under all circumstances , we have regarded whether or not what we are doing conforms with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as the highest standard in all our work , and have regarded meeting the growing needs of the material and cultural life of the people and improving the living standards of the people as the most important task .  
The session held that continually improving the material and cultural living standards of people in urban and rural areas is the starting and end point of economic development .

The development of the eastern regions has been and remains an extremely important force in supporting the overall national economy in finance , material , and technology , and is also an indispensable condition for supporting the western development and the accelerated development of central and west China .  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .  
Under such circumstances , international criminal cliques have adopted more concealed and roundabout smuggling tactics .  For example , the illegal immigrants captured by Hong Kong this time were arranged by criminals in Hong Kong . They falsely reported the material inside the containers .  
We must make the development of material progress and cultural and ideological progress a unified fighting goal , always concentrating on both jobs and attaching equal importance to both to satisfy the ever-growing , multifaceted cultural and ideological needs of the people , achieving an overall improvement in the quality of the people and enhancing national solidarity .

In the last three years , Shanghai 's textile industry has imposed the mandatory reduction of 863,000 units of cotton and textile spindles and equipment installed in the 1970 ' s or earlier , thus increasing the share of more advanced equipment from 30.6 percent to 61.1 percent and creating the material condition for transforming the elite of the textile industry into a " metropolitan industry . "  
One , we must take a stronger mass viewpoint and forge closer party-masses relations : To uphold the mass viewpoint in rural work , it is vital that we uphold the basic aim of serving the peasants with our hearts and minds , uphold the basic criteria of protecting the peasants ' material interests and respecting the peasants ' democratic rights and privileges , and insist on the basic starting point of raising the peasants ' living standard . 
Wen Jiabao said that in the past 20 years , China has persistently taken economic construction as the center , constantly increased its comprehensive national strength , and laid a solid material and technical foundation of environmental protection and ecological construction .  
With respect to the reform of the circulation methods , we must put the emphasis on promoting chain operations , material circulation and allocation and delivery , multi-formatted through-transport , and other organizational forms and service formats .  Today , it is especially important to pay attention to developing material circulation and allocation and delivery and use modern management methods and service techniques to transform traditional commerce and increase the technological content and raise service standard to promote the rise in the overall standard of the circulation industry .  
The " Report " accuses the Chinese Government of adopting legislation to control the Internet , babbling that " the new laws adopted on 26 September 2000 prohibit any material whose content is held to be subverting the state regime , supporting so-called cults , sabotaging reunification with Taiwan , and damaging China 's reputation " ; it also makes the accusation that " special Internet police have been established in about 20 provinces with the aim of removing information with sexual content . "  
We must stick to the principle that both material progress and spiritual progress should be promoted in real earnest , with neither aspect being neglected .  We must earnestly step up spiritual civilization building and democratic legal system building , vigorously develop the advanced culture , and provide the campaign to " build first-rate city " with a powerful spiritual driving force , intellectual support , and legal guarantee .  
In short , we should vigorously facilitate the rational circulation and optimum allocation of production elements to ensure that material , financial , and human resources are turned to best account and bring into full play the role of markets and resources at home and abroad in the large-scale western development .

It is necessary to vigorously carry forward the lofty ideology and spirit of selfless dedication of the labor models , cultivate a worker rank with ideals , ethics , culture , and discipline , guide and stimulate the workers to actively plunge into the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and persistently influence and lead forward the whole of society with the advanced ideology of the working class .  
This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
conscientiously uphold the principle of " attending to two types of work [ the building of a material civilization and a spiritual civilization ] simultaneously , attaching equal importance of both " ; effect temporary as well as permanent solutions to existing problems , and intensify their efforts in eliminating the root causes of these problems ; and further promote , in a deep-going manner , the government 's work of building an uncorrupted administration and fighting against corruption .  
Liu Guoguang , a famous economist and special adviser to the Chinese Academy of Social Science , holds that , looking at the favorable aspects , China has abundant labor resources and a relatively high savings rate ; as a result of several decades of large-scale construction , especially since the launch of reform and opening up , China 's economic strength has been greatly enhanced , thus laying a relatively strong material basis for future development ;  
He said : During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the sports front persisted in carrying out the party 's principles and policies in the physical culture work , persistently took the improvement of the people 's physique as its principal task , and adhered to the principle of combining popularization with enhancement and promoting the coordinated development of mass sports and athletic competition , so that it has scored tremendous achievements and made significant contributions to the building of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations .  
Through vigorously popularizing scientific , healthy , and civilized modes of fitness among the broad masses , we should enable the physical culture work to play its unique role in uniting the broad masses , maintaining social stability , and promoting the building of both material and spiritual civilizations .  
Li Peng fully affirmed Guangdong 's major achievements in building material and spiritual civilization .  During the inspection tour , Li Peng had an informal discussion with relevant responsible comrades from the provincial people 's congress to solicit their opinions and suggestions on the NPC Standing Committee 's work report .  He also toured enterprises and neighborhoods to gain first-hand information on enterprise reform and urban construction , and to extend cordial greetings to manufacturing and office workers on the frontlines of production and management .  
Every leading cadre should correctly handle the relationship between the interests of the state , the collective , and the individual , pass the tests placed on them by their dependants and offspring , cultivate a noble and upright spirit , maintain an honest style of work , avoid being led astray by material or affections , build a strong ideological and ethical defense line , and enhance their capacity to reject corruption and prevent degeneracy .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
We stress the importance of unleashing and developing productive forces and building an advanced culture , but the purpose of all this is , in the final analysis , to realize , develop , and safeguard the people 's interests and continuously meet the ever-increasing material and cultural demands of the general public .  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .  This is a result of the efforts that Sichuan and Yunnan provincial party committees and provincial governments have made in leading the broad ranks of cadres and masses all over the two provinces to work hard , but live plainly , and forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit .  
Wen Jiabao said : To raise the level of industrial management of agriculture , first , it is necessary to bring the exemplary and stimulating role of major organizations into full play ; such organizations should form rational relations with peasants , make it possible for them to get material gain , and bring about common development .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .  
Promoting comprehensive economic and social development , properly building the material and spiritual civilizations , making efforts to promote the coordinated development of the urban and rural areas and of different regions , keeping economic development , population , resources , and the environment in line , and bringing about sustainable economic and social development are the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , are important expression of our party 's " three represents " thinking , and are also the direction for the process of socialist modernization which we must firmly grasp .  
We must persistently take economic construction as the center , build a high degree of material and spiritual civilizations , speed up the comprehensive progress of various social undertakings , and strive to satisfy the people 's increasing material and cultural needs .  
Judged from what has been reflected by the grassroots , right now there are too many inspections , conferences , social etiquette , and functions of all kinds , and they are very time-consuming and high-class .  Consequently , huge manpower and material resources have been wasted .  All levels of leading cadres , who find it hard to cope with , have poured out endless grievances .  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
We will not merely stay at the growth of per capita income but , more importantly , make efforts in numerous areas including the consumption structure , living environment , social security , public services , medical treatment and healthcare , spiritual demands , and so on so that the material , spiritual , and cultural demands of the vast number of people are satisfied as much as possible , and their quality in life is improved .  
This is because we have already found a right road of development suited to China 's national conditions , secured a stable social and political situation , acquired quite a solid material and technological base , and possessed a large market and rich resources , and finally we have 1.2 billion industrious and talented people .  
After consulting the Hong Kong Internet Service Providers Association ( HKISPA ) , TELA extracted information on such websites from the aforesaid publications and passed it to five Internet service providers ( ISPs ) which provide special Internet service for youngsters for reference .  This is to facilitate consideration by ISPs concerned as to what appropriate follow-up action to take having regard to the Code of Practice on regulation of transmission of obscene and indecent material on the Internet promulgated by the HKISPA .  
Comparing 1997 with 1996 , the tonnage of seaborne inward cargo of most principal commodities increased .  More notable increases were recorded for paper and paper products ( + 22% ) , other manufactured goods classified chiefly by material ( + 20% ) , iron and steel ( + 18% ) , live animals chiefly for food and edible animal products ( + 16% ) and artificial resins and plastic materials ( + 10% ) .  
Yet , while we benefit from a rich material life and the sophisticated infrastructures we have developed , we shall never overlook the problems that come with our development .  Some of the major concerns of people at large are the air quality , marine and river pollution , and some indiscernible ecological problems .  
( d ) In general , for reclamation works where the marine mud is not dredged away , a suitable geotextile fabric is placed on top of the marine mud to contain it in position while allowing water dissipation .  It is then covered with a layer of sand to help control lateral displacement of the mud and to drain away the water dissipated from the marine mud .  Fill material is then placed on the sand in layers of uniform thickness until the reclamation is complete .  
Also , crates or cages for storage of live water birds must be made of stainless steel or other durable , smooth , impervious and non-absorbent material and be fitted with removable trays at the bottom of each crate or cage for reception of droppings .  
The conditions stipulate that , among other things , all crates or cages for storage of live poultry shall be constructed of stainless steel or other durable , smooth , impervious and non-absorbent material , and be fitted with removable trays made of the same material at the bottom of each crate or cage for reception of poultry droppings .  
The Code lays down detailed requirements on how to handle obscene and indecent materials transmitted via the Internet . These include requiring members of the Association to take appropriate measures to prevent Internet users from placing or transmitting obscene material on the Internet and to block access to the problematic Web site if necessary .  Regarding indecent material suitable for adults only , the Code requires local content providers and distributors to include in the Web page concerned a warning that such material is not suitable for publication to persons under the age of 18 .  
This report will be based on a review of all relevant and latest technical development , local as well as overseas , publications and standards on material deterioration , methods of inspection , investigation , testing , assessment and repair of buildings with particular consideration given to the three major areas of concern under BSIS , that is , integrity of external finishes , structural stability and fire safety .  
Section 19A ( 1 ) provides that , where a provision of an Ordinance is ambiguous or obscure , or its ordinary meaning in the context in which it is used leads to a result that is absurd or unreasonable , then material not forming part of the Ordinance but which is capable of assisting in ascertaining the meaning of the provision ( " extrinsic material " ) , may be considered for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the provision .  
Written and directed by Jiri Srnec , founder of the Black Light Theatre of Prague , on the basis of a story by J . M . Barrie , Peter Pan will be presented with the magical technique of " black light " , an effect produced by ultra-violet light to give white or light coloured material an unearthly glow .

" The working group will continue to take a more pro-active role in controlling flytipping , through extension of opening hours for public filling areas and public barging points and giving farmers instructions on how to dispose of animal carcasses . "  " Other controlling measures include strengthening legislation on trip-ticket system for disposal of construction and demolition material , and circulating guidelines to assist the staff of its member departments in the clearance of illegal dumping of chemical waste materials , " he added .  
Based on the approved EIA report undertaken by the consultants , given that the number of vehicle trips per day is low and the material transfer station is not close to the nearby residents , no adverse environmental impacts to the nearby residents are anticipated from the operation of the works area .  
International speakers had been invited to Hong Kong to discuss what it means to be human and how human values are defined in the twenty-first century , together with the issues of our ( post ) information age , telecommunication and cybersphere , the anthropogenetic domain of built environment and material urban landscape , digital beings in a so-called post-human condition which humans have collectively created and inhabited .  
Nonetheless , in the light of increased cross-market developments in a technology-convergent environment , we propose that " companies which transmit sound or television material " , " companies which supply programmes for broadcasting by a licensee " and " the sole or dominant supplier of a public switched telephone service by wire to residential premises in Hong Kong " should be deleted from the list of disqualified persons , i.e . persons prohibited from exercising control of domestic free and domestic pay service licensees except with the prior approval of the Chief Executive in Council . 
" The principal element of the offence is that the person knowingly provides information to the SFC or the market operator in question that is false , misleading or incomplete in a material particular , or that he does not believe that the information provided is true , complete and accurate in every material particular .  
The Chief Executive expressed interest in a number of products developed and produced by the Rapid Product Development Syndicate of PolyU . These included a selection of smart toys and appliances which demonstrated the successful application of space technology material , and a diesel particulate trap filter for vehicles .  
Another key success that we have had in applying EIA was the abandonment of a project which proposed the excavation of 400 million cubic metres of fill material from Mirs Bay to the east of Hong Kong : one of the most pristine , valuable marine ecosystems left in Hong Kong . EIA has saved it from destruction and preserved it for present and future generations to enjoy . 
" Cargo material contained in the cargo hold bilge water is not treated as cargo residues provided that the cargo material is not classified as a marine pollutant in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and the bilge water is discharged from a loaded hold through the vessel 's fixed piping bilge drainage system . "  
We have worked hard since then to realise this goal .  This has included drafting and enacting new legislation ; selecting a strong team of financial institutions to prepare , manage and underwrite the Share Offer ; and developing a comprehensive advertising campaign , which starts tomorrow .  You have probably noticed some of the material already ; and we will preview the rest shortly .  
( ii ) inspect the site , or direct a safety supervisor to inspect the site for the purpose of determining whether any work carried on inside or near lift shafts or the hoistways of material hoists is of such a nature as to be liable to cause risk of bodily injury to any person employed on the site ;  
( a ) The Securities and Futures Commission ( SFC ) and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong ( SEHK ) monitor , through market surveillance systems , unusual price movements ( whether upward or downward ) and turnover volume of shares of listed companies to ensure that the securities market is fair and orderly and is kept informed of material information .  
" The reversal in the crime trend is in large a result of measure taken under the CCB 's approach which led to successful prosecutions of cases handled by the Bureau , sending a warning to those who consider engaging in the illicit trade .  " In addition to enhanced sentences for prevalent offence under the OSCO , companies with dubious or allegedly uttered accounts may be required to produce material concerning their business upon the issue of an order under section 4 of the same ordinance , " the spokesman said .  
To guard against the dilapidation risk of the older properties , the Approved Sellers will be required to provide a satisfactory valuation report by a qualified valuer confirming that the underlying property is free of any material negative findings or unauthorized structural modifications .

A licensee should not include in its programmes any material that is indecent , obscene , or of bad taste and which is not acceptable to ordinary viewers .  
This is because the form of the libation cup coincides with the natural tapering form of the horn , making the best use of this very rare material .  A second reason is based on the common belief that the cup may exude antidotal and mind-pacifying medicinal properties of the rhinoceros horn into the liquid it contains .  
Today this new plant at Tung Hsiao produces 100,000 metric tons of high quality refined salt annually . About 130,000 metric tons of crude salt originally required as raw material for the manufacturing of refined salt will be saved annually to meet the pressing needs of rapidly growing industries .  
These boys and girls are fortunate to have lived in peaceful times , never really lacking , never suffering . They have married and are expecting the arrival of the next generation in the same happy and peaceful state of mind . They will bring up their own babies with abundant love , considerate care and the best material provisions they can afford .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
Furthermore , hydraulic power has been exploited to the maximum in Taiwan already . Though there is great potential in the development of nuclear power , the sources of raw material are mainly overseas , and the radioactive residue is difficult to dispose of .  
Amid the beautiful scenery and mild weather in this secluded paradise , the residents , who are mostly farmers , can enjoy a simple life which is enhanced by the most modern material conveniences .  
Anyone who sees the raw material after it is imported into Taiwan will inevitably ask : " How can these ugly-looking , twisted vines be transformed into such outstanding furniture ? " At the Ye Fun plant , each piece is measured and placed in a different warehouse according to size .  
When a scene takes place in the emperor 's palace the most formal of all costumes , the Mang , is worn by both civilian and military officials . In ordinary scenes such characters would wear a less formal Pi , and when in their homes they can wear the even more casual Chetzu . These three costumes are made of soft material and have gentle lines .  
A hollow statue mold , made of any material , was layered on the inside with pieces of fine cloth and lacquer . The resulting dried piece was removed from the mold and finished . Vegetable oil was applied to give the statue a lustrous sheen .  
Yet closer examination reveals that the garments covering the ladies ' shoulders and necks are actually made of very thin , transparent material . While women of the early T'ang were strong yet slim , by the late T'ang they were more amply endowed , reflecting their rich court lifestyle .  
Work on the plan , supported by a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development , got under way in July 1984 and is expected to take six years to complete . The ultimate goal is to store the complete text of China 's 25 traditional dynastic histories , around 60 million Chinese characters , onto one thin computer disk , enabling researchers to search , index , and analyze the material by software commands .  
" Recalling the smiling innocence of childhood and searching for the vanished past , for those bits and pieces seared in us so deeply , be they the sweet , the grand , the happy dreams of memory or the disconsolate , the painful , and the lonely ones . . . that is the material that can thrill me or can fill my eyes with tears , and that is what has fascinated me with photography .  
With the development of science and technology , the amount of waste is increasing at an alarming rate all over the world , including many items which are not biodegradable . In addition , the habit of frugality has been flagging with the advent of material plenty , and things are as easily thrown out as they are acquired .  
The major material for their paintings consisted of metal oxides , iron oxide being the most commonly used . The use of metal oxides could produce red , blue , and yellow colors , and if heated , the colors would multiply .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
Today there is yet another " transitional period , " which calls for yet again undertaking deep examination - - only by balancing the wisdom accumulated over time with the flourishing development of material culture from the West can we assure a peaceful and prosperous future for mankind .  
To use wooden fish to temper one 's mind has a very symbolic meaning . The never-sleeping eyes tell us that Buddhist cultivation is limitless and that the cleansing process is endless . The masters living in the tranquil temple purify their inner selves day and night . What about we who remain in the material world ?  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
Confucian propriety constrained people 's unfettered nature and maintained harmonious social relations ; Taoism 's unworldliness let people free themselves from material temptations , emphasized the aesthetic side of life , and allowed people to find spiritual satisfaction beyond material things through the contemplation of nature .  
Some people have criticized the education of gifted children as elitist , as a " gilded lily " taking up valuable educational resources , but Tzeng Su-jung , a doctor of education , disagrees . " If gifted students are put in ordinary classes and wind up with blank expressions all the time because they 've mastered the material , is n't that a form of learning disadvantage , too ? "  
Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions . Starting from a rapid-fire " chopstick gun " invented by Taiwanese kids , he began to collect toy weapons from other countries and investigate their construction and performance . From our own history he found a rapid-fire crossbow from the Three Kingdoms Period , and has written a short paper on the subject .  
Perestroika , Glasnost , and so on gave Soviet citizens a temporary vision of hope and prosperity . But the subsequent conservative reaction , economic difficulties , material shortages , and the threat of national disintegration have swept this vast and ancient land . "  
It 's Not a Battle Between Ecology and Development ! : Huang Ta-pang , who has worked in the PBM for over 40 years , states that the marble now imported from Italy , which has excellent color , superior quality , and few cracks or fissures and is easily processed , is already the finest available material . And it is n't expensive . The costs of mining in Taiwan are high , and even if you just figure in the best mines , it is still impossible to compete .  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
But , functionally speaking , the transport capabilities of the electric vehicle simply ca n't compete with the power produced by burning fuel . Thus the electrical version ca n't be widely applied . In fact , it can only be considered for use in special circumstances , as passenger transports for airports , as material transporters in enclosed compounds , or as golf carts , which do not involve long distances or high speeds .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
This company located in Kaohsiung originally made badminton racquet heads , whose main raw material is cork . Not only does cork have to be imported from abroad , it is even more troublesome to deal with the waste after the wood is processed .  
The owner of one old wooden house , no longer willing to put up with rotting sills and doorposts , had his home rebuilt ; but although he no longer used wood as a material , he retained the original upper halves of the walls , along with the lion 's -head panel over the doorway , achieving not a bad compromise in keeping alive the traditional folk customs and beliefs .  
The complexity of the engineering for Three Gorges has enabled the two sides to produce vast amounts of technical material on flood prevention , electrical power generation , transport , economic efficiency , water supply , siltation , and similar subjects . There are even cases of mainland engineers being labelled as " rightist " and having their whole families dragged down with them just because they opposed the project .  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations . TaKing great pains to gather these photos and art work that others saw as waste paper , he has cut them up and pasted them together into 150 collages that accompany the text .  
Last year , during the school 's summer camp , there were posters all over the school proclaiming " Say No to Drugs . " From a discussion about rampant drug abuse in the United States , she delved into modern Chinese history , examining how China lost power and was humiliated after the Opium War . Using a biography of Lin Tze-hsu as supplementary educational material , she was able to capture the students ' interest .  
This combination of Sun 's own words with journalistic evidence to provide both subjective and objective views was extremely well received . But in fact there are very few examples of objectively critical authorized biographies of " big league " politicians . Most authors wishing to write about political figures adopt the second-best approach of collecting material indirectly in a round-about " covert operation . "  
As you move on , do n't neglect the field of small white flowers . This area was mostly Taiwan paulownia , and these are the flowers of that plant . The explanatory placard says , " A beautiful melody is unforgettable . " It is only when you read the commentary that you know that this wood is excellent material for pianos or violins because it is light , soft , and does not burn easily .  
Most of English-language radio station ICRT 's listening audience are students . David Wang , host of " The Youth Nightline , " believes that what concerns young people are passing exams , careers , interpersonal communication and male / female relations . But because this material gets mulled over a lot , " we have to interject topics from the news too . " In fact , he believes that such controversial and timely issues as campus violence and sex education are very well-received .  
At that time , two Peipo women discovered by chance that when dried , the wild rushes from the wetlands where the Ta-an River flows into the sea are extremely tough and flexible and highly resistant to splitting , making them a very suitable material for making everyday utensils .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
Seeing through " Huang Fei-hong the idol , " Peng Han-ping believes that the reason Bruce Lee was acknowledged as a hero was because he combined Chinese Wing Chun kungfu with Western fighting techniques to create his own " Stop Fist " kungfu , and his films display real martial arts skill ; to this day , they remain very valuable material for martial arts students to study . But Jet Li 's kungfu is just " display kungfu , " flashy and beautiful , but only good for brief entertainment .  
Transient desiresHaving grown up in the wealthy environment after Taiwan 's economic development reached maturity , the new new youth are sophisticated about more than just material things . In recent years the problems of divorce and extramarital affairs have become increasingly serious , the schools have gone co-ed , boys and girls have manifold opportunities to meet , and there is information about sex everywhere one turns . Young people have come to grips with intersex relations earlier than previous generations .  
In the view of Huang Chun-ming , an associate professor of architecture at Chung Yuan Christian University , they did this because they got sick of the wasted time and effort of tearing holes through the walls every time they laid a new road . They figured they might as well just tear down the whole thing , using the salvaged stone as a material for the public structures they were building .  
This is when the problems began . Firstly , when the temple was demolished , the parts were sold off cheap as scrap material , and the demolition was done extremely roughly . The exquisitely carved spirit niche was cut in half , and large wooden structural elements without carvings , such as beams and columns , were thrown away altogether .  
But in hunting and fishing society with its low productivity , faced with the harsh realities of nature and a lack of material resources , people gradually extended the range of resources they could use . For instance , the Oroqen people of northeast China once had a taboo against eating bears and tigers , but gradually came to eat bear meat and use bear skins for clothing . But a people which faces the constant threat of death and hunger both needs animals and fears them , and this has given rise to many hunters ' taboos .  
" Moon Children " was originally selected as material for a show to be aired over public television . But this " magnum opus " of more than 70 episodes laboriously filmed over two years was held up by administrative procedures at public television , which wanted to air it reduced to 44 minutes , in two segments .  
Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
There 's nothing difficult about running an official publication : " Just handle it like a regular official document . " Topics were set out by the Printed Materials Department , which handled all government publications , and relevant agencies were asked for material and photographs .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
For example , every time he heard tell of a construction project going on within the range of the ruins , Tacheng Middle School teacher Chien Shih-lang would grab a metal screen and head for the dirt pile to " search for treasure , " sifting out from the dirt pile shards of stone coffin and other objects stirred up by the backhoes and arranging them in separate bags . He saved them , both as a record of local history and also as classroom material of local interest .  
In addition , and more worthy of attention , a number of jade pendants and other decorative objects made from " Taiwan soft jade " have been found at Tamalin . A large amount of jade craft waste material has also been found . This situation resembles that uncovered in Wanjung Rural Township in Hualien , which is known as a " jade handicraft site " of prehistoric people .  
The material most often used to simulate bronze is fiber-reinforced plastic with a coat of metallic paint . But this would not be realistic enough , and after some time the paint would begin to flake off . For better effect , Lin Chien-cheng added powdered metal to an acid - and alkali-resistant , non-oxidizing resin which he formed manually into the shapes required . He then polished them to create an effect which really does look completely like bronze .  
" Assuming that the initial French recording process was in violation of the law , then all future uses of this unauthorized material , including those by Enigma and the IOC , would all be unlawful as well , " explains Huang Hsiu-lan , Difag 's attorney , in a firm tone of voice . She has received approval from Difag to use " the most intensive legal methods " to handle the case .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
The electricity runs through the circuits like the transmitting material in the human nervous system , which allows the brain to remember , select , calculate , and even listen , speak , read , and write , undertaking all kinds of " intelligent " tasks . The applications of the flow of electric current in a circuit are virtually limitless :  
Such endings are both happy and tragic , for they never go outside the conventional standards of life in the material world . Even today , many parents are tied to the notion that " in books one will naturally find a face as pretty as jade , " and admonish their children to " study hard-once you pass the exams and get into university , there 'll be plenty of pretty girls ! "  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
Laozi says of the Way : " There was something composed of many things , before heaven and earth were born . " The Way existed before the material world , and seems to move in a never-ending cycle characterized by " departing , becoming distant and returning . " It is an invisible and unceasing motive force within the universe , and the real creator and mover of all visible , physical things .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
The lower end of the neck on each of the heads ends in a pointed diamond shape , suggesting that the heads were all mounted on bodies made of some other material , and that they were arranged in solemn majesty around an altar , with the big bronze statue standing in the center . After the sacred rite was completed , the beautifully crafted statues and ceremonial implements were burnt , broken , and placed in the pit . Why would anyone have done this ?  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
The scrap contained large amounts of insulation material made of plastics containing chlorine , so burning it produced highly toxic dioxin . The stench from the fires forced pupils at the nearby Nanning Junior High School to wear cotton face masks to school , and there were high rates of respiratory tract diseases among local residents .  
From Arabic literature 's Aladdin to the native American tale of Pocahontas , from The Hunchback of Notre Dame , steeped in Gallic ambience , to Hercules , rooted in Greek and Roman mythology , Disney has long sought out material with a world-wide appeal . Seeking a feeling of intimacy and a clear delineation between good and evil , their animated features employ fables and animals to dissolve the cultural barriers that lie hidden under their auras of exoticism .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
It 's a chicken-and-egg problem . The best work that appears in Biographical Literature are the stories written by participants in history themselves . Each time there were power shifts in Republican era , another group of elites was washed out ; later , settled in Taiwan and far removed from day-to-day politics , they were willing to write for the magazine . Being good writers with broad perspectives , naturally they produced exciting and engrossing material , which , by keeping the standards of the magazine up , attracted more of the same .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
Jade has always been close to the hearts of the Chinese , and while glass was a glittering and translucent material in the West , inspired by precious stones of varying colors , in China it developed primarily as a jade substitute , having a soft , opaque texture .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei-fei , " Wang notes . " Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly . " Moreover , she has had the right material , with producer Peter Li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde . This has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
Lin remarks that a 40% cut for the franchisor is reasonable since Wayoung started out as a material supplier , specializing in importing activated charcoal reverse osmosis filters , which are the key component for purifying water .  
In the novel , humans have long since created intelligent computers , the Earth is in the complete control of a cosmic computer alliance , all material needs are met , the genetic codes of all organisms have been fully decoded , the human dream of eternal youth has been realized , and humans can acquire all kinds of knowledge at any time through the network communication systems that they carry with them .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Once you reduce its thickness to 50 nanometers , light can easily pass through it , so that it no longer reflects light . Its color changes from gold to red , and it becomes an excellent material for pregnancy test kits . Once gold is manufactured as thin as 50 nanometers , it goes from being extremely stable to being extremely volatile , allowing it to be used in many different applications as a catalyst or activator .  
Theoretically , composite ceramic molecules laid at thicknesses of 10 to 30 nanometers will emit infrared waves at the most ideal wavelength for keeping food fresh . Currently , industry has attained levels of 70-90 nanometers . The refrigerators employ a coating of this material on aluminum trays to keep fish fresh , and also on a carpet-like material to line the compartments for fruit and vegetables . They are quite effective .  
Yang once decided to grind pearl down to nano levels , and discovered that he had destroyed the amino acid , releasing a foul odor and ruining the raw material .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
Pots made from blackish ash-colored clay are also few in number , but they too have some special characteristics . The jars and vases have small mouths and big bellies . The material is of very fine quality and the exterior surfaces have undergone smoothing and polishing . There are broken lines and circles on the exterior surfaces of the " shoulder " portion , and these decorative line patterns normally encircle the outside of the vessel .  
Nautica won the affections of consumers with an appreciation for quality-made athletic clothing . Customers were first allured by the clothing 's colorful vitality and the unaffected simplicity of the design . However , upon further inspection they would discover that the clothing was very practical , as well . From the material and the tailoring work , to the location of the pockets and the adjustable sleeves , all the way down to minute details like the size of the zipper , Nautica 's quality was immediately self-evident .  
In addition to writing , he quietly produced Wenyou Tongxun , a periodical that kept alive the flickering flame of " homegrown " literature by gathering together and publishing works by scattered Nativist writers . Not everyone writing under the banner of anti-Communist literature in its heyday produced hackneyed material .  
In Taiwanese society at large , everyone has gained the right to freedom of expression and is able to criticize publicly the political situation , even the president and high officials . Within the literary field , a myriad of new directions have opened up . Aboriginal literature , new feminist literature , environmental literature , gay literature , and pornographic literature have taken the stage one after another , providing material for readers of every taste .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
Huang had the material made into underwear and after wearing if for two months noticed a gradual improvement in her gastric ulcer problem . Although at that time she remained skeptical she decided to make two new items after which the improvement in her health became much more pronounced . In January 1994 , Huang visited a professor at Tsinghua University in the hope of becoming an agent for the sale of the technology that had helped her so much .  
By way of contrast , he mentions Bertelsmann of Germany . Bertelsmann is trying to get into the mainland market through distribution , marketing , and sales . Although they already have agreement from " the highest levels , " they are still moving cautiously . They do n't sell any books of a " sensitive nature " ( such as histories that show the present in an unflattering or derisive light , risque material , or books that test the margins of permissible speech ) .  
" But when they reached middle age , and their material dreams were satisfied , they felt spiritual emptiness , as a result of which many turned to dissipated lifestyles , extramarital affairs , and religious escapism , " says Wang Chung-kwei , chairman of the Department of Psychology at Soochow University , who is a long-time student of generational differences in Taiwan . This is one reason why spiritual and religious topics have garnered so much attention in Taiwan in recent years .  
However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
A loose hat flies up into the air , and someone curious to see how a helicopter delivers construction material is forced by the strong wind and sand kicked up by the helicopter to squint as , eyes barely open , he watches the helicopter as it lowers heavy solar panels to the ground and then flies off in the direction of Taoshan .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
the session decided to approve the inclusion of the project in the ten year program for national economic and social development , and authorize the state council to carry it out at an appropriate time , in light of the actual development of the national economy and the country 's financial and material force  
A number of delegations stated that this database on human rights source material should be guided by the principles of indivisibility of all human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
$ 17,500 , at maintenance level , for overtime and night service differential to retain clerical and distribution staff , and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
The procedure for valuing the movable and immovable property lost by refugees and persons subjected to forced resettlement , assessing material losses and paying compensation shall be determined jointly by the Parties concerned .  
Its recent expansion from 3 to 10 full members makes ECO a major regional grouping and an important international entity with vast combined potential in terms of material and human resources .  
In order to achieve the required level of services , enhanced coordination and technological innovation were indispensable , but equally essential was the provision of adequate human and material resources .  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
Improvement of the quality of life in the ESCWA region , encompassing material and nonmaterial aspects , is closely correlated with proper management of natural resources and economic development .  
I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
The efforts of a United Nations Member in environmental protection have been reduced to those at the national level and it has been left to rely on its own modest material and human resources .  
The need to develop innovative material for use at the primary and secondary school levels , within universities and in professional training , especially for the judiciary , law enforcement officials , the military , and medical and social workers ;  
Improving the reliability , utility and public availability of statistical and other information material on social development , including on gender issues , at the national , regional and international levels .  
Those services , which included advice and material assistance , were provided through social welfare ministries and bodies , and were not only offered at the national level , but also extended to friendly and fraternal States .  
As poverty was both a material and an immaterial disadvantage , the aim should be to raise income and to promote the development of the full potential of the individual and the participation of the underprivileged in social , political and economic decisions .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
At the end of this twentieth century , thanks to mankind 's achievements in science and technology and in communication and production , and thanks also to the hard work of all nations , our world as a whole has become more prosperous and more alive , with the manifold increase in material and non-material flows and exchanges , thus facilitating better mutual understanding and closer relationships among nations .  
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
African countries have committed themselves repeatedly to carry out far-reaching economic and institutional reforms , on the express understanding that their efforts would be fully complemented by the requisite material support of the international community , particularly the advanced countries .  
At the same time , the General Assembly must always be solicitous of this principal organ when it comes to preserving the dignity of eminent international judges and their staff and when human and material resources are required to enhance the efficacy of this institution and to promote good and diligent administration of international justice .  
In particular , the Secretariat would be requested to provide orally an estimate of the cost of the relevant document before it is demanded by Member States , stricter page limits would be established , oral reports would be encouraged , the Secretariat would be asked to consolidate reports on related topics , repetitive historical material would be eliminated and the use of paperless technology would be promoted .  
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
Our Government , headed by His Excellency Joaqu \ x { 74af } Balaguer , and the people that I represent join in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , and share the hope that the Organization 's efforts and successes will continue to increase in the continuing search for a just , united , common and fraternal humanity , sharing the material and spiritual assets of a civilization that can lead us to see people as part of a common humanity .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
The report is lucid , concise and clear , and I take this opportunity to express OIC 's appreciation to the Secretary-General not only for the timely presentation of the useful material , but also for his continuing untiring efforts towards finding a just and honourable solution of the issue of Palestine .  
We should resolutely address the endogenous impediments to growth and development , which include political instability , ineffective and inefficient utilization of both human and material resources , inappropriate priority-setting , ill-conceived policy orientation and ill-designed and impractical implementation mechanisms . 
The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
This dual objective can not be achieved unless existing stockpiles of weapons-usable fissile material form an integral part of the negotiations , as reflected in the report of the Special Coordinator on this issue in the Conference on Disarmament and as indicated in the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee established within its framework .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
Developing local strategies for improving the quality of life and the environment , integrating decisions on land use and land management , investing in the public and private sectors and mobilizing human and material resources , thereby promoting employment generation that is environmentally sound and protective of human health .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
Moreover , as has been demonstrated in Nepal , while such benefits may be enjoyed within the country itself , many benefits from conservation are realized outside the country 's borders in forms as diverse as reduced flooding because of the protection of upland forests , the supply of medicinal plants and genetic material , or the pleasure given to international tourists .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
Indeed , despite the precarious situation and the difficulties inherent in moving from confrontation to cooperation on the path to national reconciliation , the steps taken by both parties and the stages that have already been passed have greatly helped to meet the conditions for the systematic implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , with a United Nations presence , whose human and material resources can measure up to its tasks . 
Nuclear establishments and the transport of nuclear material required appropriate physical protection , and States needed to have effective border controls so that they had control over what left their territory and were able to carry out their non-proliferation obligations not to permit sensitive nuclear materials to be transmitted to non-peaceful programmes or to terrorist groups .  
The main institution officially entrusted with the maintenance of public security is the National Police , which , according to a December 1994 study carried out by a Multinational Commission on Public Security , 2 / is seriously lacking in human and material resources , and is involved chiefly in administrative and protection functions in urban areas .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
This blockade is being accompanied daily by heavy artillery shelling and murderous air-raids which have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians in southern Lebanon and in the western Bekaa and caused considerable material damage .  
All designated depository libraries are expected to place the material received in the care of qualified library staff , to keep it in good order and to make it accessible to the public , free of charge , at reasonable hours .  
Despite the success in providing compulsory primary education for girls and boys under adverse conditions , the quality of the education system and educational achievement are not satisfactory because of overcrowded schools , double shifts at the elementary level , lack of maintenance , inadequate teacher training , lack of educational material and low salaries . 
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
" Each State party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide : ( a ) source or special fissionable material , or ( b ) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use , or production of special fissionable material , to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes , unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this article ( IAEA safeguards ) . "  
For exports to a non-nuclear-weapon State not party to the Treaty , source or special fissionable material either directly transferred , or produced , processed , or used in the facility for which the transferred item is intended , shall not be diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Technical material . ( i ) Maintaining relevant databases and other information systems concerning hazardous waste generation , treatment technologies and regulatory and other instruments ; ( ii ) four updated PC-version of the database of the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals and distribution of subsets thereof ; and ( iii ) establishment of one regional information network . ( a ) Advisory service .

Among the points of discussion were the recruitment of students to central or local mine-clearance training schools ; the need for expatriate staff or technical advisers to stay on after the initial establishment of a national demining programme ; a recommendation that the United Nations provide pre-tailored material for new demining operations , including standard operating procedures , training and materials .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .

While welcoming the meeting held in Tombouctou on 16 and 17 July 1995 between the Government of Mali and northern Mali 's development partners , the Ministers renewed their appeal to the entire international community to increase its material and financial support for the implementation of all the provisions of the National Pact and for the consolidation of the peace process under way in the country .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
Considering that the ultimate purpose of the State is none other than to create more equitable societies in which all members can realize their full human potential in terms of the material satisfaction of their basic needs and their intellectual and spiritual development in conditions of freedom , dignity , equality of opportunity and full respect for fundamental human rights ,  
We believe that the formulation of this concept , including aspects of financial , material and technical support by the international community for the peace process in Liberia , requires a realistic , weighted approach based on the provisions of previous Security Council resolutions .  
Thus , the Special Rapporteur now defines visual pornography as " the visual depiction of a child engaged in explicit sexual activity , real or simulated , or the lewd exhibition of genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material " .  
The Ministers expressed their support for the completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty no later than 1996 as well as the early conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminating and universally applicable convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Its objectives are : training of the key stakeholders in understanding the requirements and setting up the processes for the implementation of the Convention at the national level , and provision of substantive training material covering the Convention and providing the framework for wide-reaching in-country training by a country team set up and trained through the programme .  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .

However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
Preschool institutions , homes for children deprived of parental care , disabled children and youth institutions for juvenile delinquents , are also in an increasingly difficult material situation , manifested by a poor quality of food and a considerable decline of standards , including poor hygienic standards , insufficient heating , inadequate maintenance , the impossibility to keep facilities and equipment in proper repair .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .

The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The desire of a number of countries , including the Russian Federation ( which as a result of the imposition of sanctions has suffered and continues to suffer very substantial material and financial losses ) to elaborate practical ways and means to prevent the negative consequences of sanctions or , at least , to keep them to a minimum , are therefore fully justified .  
On this occasion , I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Governments of various countries , the affiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , non-governmental organizations , and individuals for their moral , material and humanitarian assistance and encouragement to our people , which have been provided in the hope of removing , as quickly as possible , the damage caused in recent years by successive natural disasters .  
Furthermore , these leaders unanimously called for in-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first century with a restructured , reinvigorated Organization , equipped with the necessary human , material and financial resources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission of an Organization that harmonizes the complementary efforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in a context of freedom and active solidarity . 
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .

Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .

Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;

Potential carbon dioxide utilization , disposal , and storage options include enhanced oil recovery , storage in depleted natural gas fields and other underground reservoirs , chemical feedstocks and other basic material , and finally disposal in the deep ocean .  
Table 2 shows that 32,483 work-months , that is 62 per cent of the total work-months utilized , were committed for the implementation of activities that generate final outputs under the major categories of parliamentary services , published material and information services . 
We pledge our support for efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) designated as not intended for use for meeting defence requirements is safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant voluntary offer IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
Support efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) not intended for use in meeting defence requirements is safely and effectively stored and protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant " voluntary offer " IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so ;  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;

These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
The energy sector ( petroleum and electricity ) has suffered considerable material losses as a result of the mandatory sanctions applied pursuant to Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) , and negative repercussions have been felt in most of the vital facilities and economic entities of that sector .  
The need to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and to adopt appropriate and effective measures to ensure the prevention , detection and punishment of offences relating to nuclear material , which are a matter of grave concern to the international community , led the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to adopt the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 13 / at Vienna on 26 October 1979 .

However , zero nuclear weapons might not be a stable , reassuring zero unless all fissile material , and the dedicated nuclear infrastructure , has been placed under satisfactory international control .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
For the international regime for the storage and control of plutonium , the question for the near future is hardly whether or not to establish a full-fledged regime , but whether to prepare a legal framework and an option for countries to deposit fissile material when they deem that desirable , hence proceeding in a gradual , pragmatic fashion .  
The Special Rapporteur has maintained and continues to maintain that mercenaries exist ; that they are not a small number of individuals ; that they are groups of professionals selling their skill in war and violence ; that they are also criminal organizations , an international blight in their perpetration of acts of violence which ruin human lives , create material losses , hamper economic activity and extend to terrorist attacks that have touched off or aggravated conflicts , with often catastrophic results for the peoples affected by them .

Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
Makes an impassioned appeal to the United Nations system and to intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to join in providing assistance to those segments of the population most gravely affected by the embargo and whose already grim economic , material and health conditions are being greatly exacerbated by the total blockade imposed against Burundi , namely , displaced persons , returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
They combine reckless exploitation of living resources in these zones with the dumping of hazardous material and other equally repugnant activities contrary to international law and civilized conduct .  
Provision of legal , social , financial and material assistance to victims of trafficking ( physical and psychological rehabilitation , professional retraining , provision of shelter , lawyers , hot-line services , medical aid , assistance in contacts with the police , embassies , etc . ) as well as to their families ;  
Makes an impassioned appeal to the United Nations system and to intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to join in providing assistance to those segments of the population most gravely affected by the embargo and whose already grim economic , material and health conditions are being greatly exacerbated by the total blockade imposed against Burundi , namely , displaced persons , returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ;

The material means of progress can be acquired , but human resources - skilled , spirited and inventive workers - are indispensable , as is the enrichment found through mutual dialogue and the free interchange of ideas .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
During the period under review , the Council 's informal working group on documentation and other procedural questions worked hard to find ways of satisfying the wish of Member States to receive in a timely manner a substantive , analytical and material account of the Council 's work .  
We , who have a closed fuel cycle nuclear power programme , have consistently opposed the inclusion of spent fuel , which is a valuable resource material , along with radioactive waste in this convention .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
As a result of the firm resolve of the leaders of ECOWAS and the determination of ECOMOG , coupled with the enhanced material and logistic support received from friendly countries within and outside the subregion , the disarmament of the warring factions was successfully accomplished as scheduled , on 31 January 1997 .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
We would like first and foremost to express our gratitude to those States and international organizations that have continued to provide financial and material support to Djibouti , particularly those that participated in and made pledges during the round table on Djibouti held at Geneva in May 1997 .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
All of these factors combined make it vitally important that the international community mobilize its efforts to achieve a rapid settlement while continuing to provide needed humanitarian and material assistance in other words , we need a comprehensive strategy for rehabilitation to go with the current ongoing efforts to settle the problem of Afghanistan .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
The difficulties experienced in the search for mines and remnants of war on Libyan territory due to the lack of maps and precise data on location , number and type , in addition to the fact that they are scattered at random over an extensive area , make it hard to give a comprehensive and precise report on the human and material losses caused by landmines and remnants of war in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . 
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The limited human , technical and material national resources have been concentrated on sweeping areas where mines and remnants of war are known to be present , and where their location has been established by citizens ' reports on the accidents they have caused or by companies carrying out development projects .  
One commentary on the 1988 Convention ; two publications on laws and regulations to give effect to international drug control treaties ; two directories of competent national authorities under the international drug control treaties ; two directories on manufacturers of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors under international control ; and a cumulative index : national laws and regulations promulgated to give effect to international drug control treaties ; ( iii ) Technical material . 
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
One of the key provisions in this context is article 17 , under which States parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities " .  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
The reports are lucid , concise and clear , and I take this opportunity to express the OIC 's appreciation to , the Secretary-General not only for the timely presentation of this useful material but also for the continuing , untiring efforts towards finding an honourable solution to the Afghanistan question in cooperation with the OIC . 
The events of 28 September 1995 , during which an army of international mercenaries invaded my country , overthrew the President of the Republic , disrupted constitutional order and , consequently , State institutions , further worsened our economic crisis and led to substantial material losses and structural damage .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
Not only are large numbers of children killed and injured , but countless others grow up deprived of their material and emotional needs , including the structures that give meaning to social and cultural life .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Upon the completion of the proceedings connected with an act of nuclear terrorism , if it is considered feasible , any nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste or any other radioactive substances as well as nuclear installations , nuclear explosive or radiation-dissemination devices , including homemade devices and / or their components or objects of which they are components shall be returned to the State party , to which they belong or which was the State of their origin .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Teachers are duty-bound to nurture their pupils to have a strong moral base , free from thinking highly of counter _ cultures and material development of other countries . . . prevent them from becoming ones who will seek their own gain and betray the national cause .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
Regarding paragraphs 16 _ 21 , concerning what he calls guilt by association , the Government of Iraq wishes to emphasize that the allegations contained in these paragraphs are totally unfounded ; they are pure fabrications and biased accusations that are baseless , devoid of any material proof and intended to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national regime . 
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
This size range covers the building blocks of pristine interplanetary and cometary particles , i.e . the silicate core particles ( 100-200 nanometres ) , refractory organic mantle ( about 10 nanometres ) and possible crystalline structure of the material .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
It may be inferred from the current case law of the international legal bodies that the basis for determining the amount and nature of the compensation is not solely the physical or material injury or damage but also the direct or indirect moral injury .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
I urge each of you to consider the reinforcing impact that an FMCT would have on parallel efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads , to place fissile material that is determined to be excess to national security requirements under safeguards , and to achieve even deeper nuclear weapons reductions leading toward their eventual elimination .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
Financial , material and technical assistance complemented by a favourable international economic environment was imperative for the realization of the strategic objectives set out in Beijing .  
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
Information centres are an essential partner in this effort , whether establishing strong working relationships with the local media and responding to their inquiries ; cooperating with civil society and other local partners to promote major United Nations themes ; disseminating the Department 's products , such as booklets , brochures or United Nations radio and video programmes ; maintaining reference libraries ; translating the Department 's material into local languages ; servicing visits of the Secretary-General and other senior officials to their host countries ; or maintaining liaison with Governments .  
The international collaborative exercises constitute the first phase of the international quality assurance programme , carried out by UNDCP , in which participating laboratories are requested , twice a year , to analyse unknown samples of seized material and / or biological specimens .  
Human resources development will be achieved by organization of training courses , at basic and advanced levels , in methods for the identification and analysis of controlled drugs in seized material , pharmaceutical preparations , body fluids and precursors ; development and distribution of training syllabuses , teaching aids and scientific literature to regional training centres and collaborating institutions ; and organization of regional workshops of heads of national drug-testing laboratories .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
This included sexually explicit , abusive , seditious , terrorist or hate material or communication of false , misleading or fraudulent material .  
While understanding the difficult economic situation and the difficulty of reaching durable solutions to the refugee problem , the Committee expressed its concern with respect to the precarious material and psychological conditions of women refugees .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
At the national level , numerous charitable organizations and benevolent societies provided medical and material assistance to the poor and needy .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
This assistance is extremely important and urgent now , as unprecedented heavy rains and destructive landslides have killed dozens of people , left hundreds homeless and done enormous material damage to the national economy and to the social infrastructure .  
But it is self-evident that our national and international commitment , as well as limited human financial and material resources , mandates bilateral and regional cooperation in battling the better-equipped narco-traffickers .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
A fundamental prerequisite for transparency would be the application of consistent and strict standards of accounting and secure handling and storage procedures for fissile material at the national level .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
In that case , Iraq had refused to accede to a request by a chief inspector to be furnished with a copy of a document highly pertinent to obtaining a verifiable material balance of Iraq 's munitions filled with chemical or biological agents .  
Confidential material so classified by the coastal State shall remain confidential after consideration of the submission is concluded unless decided otherwise by the Commission with the written consent of the coastal State concerned .  
The El Nino phenomenon has a recurring character , often with severe impacts on regional weather patterns , which in their turn can result in large material , economic , human and environmental losses .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The activities concerned included training for judicial , administrative and military authorities , provision of material and logistical support to judicial authorities , as well as awareness campaigns , selection and training of government officials within ministries to act as human rights focal points , capacity-building for non _ governmental organizations , and training initiatives with a focus on social and economic rights .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
These could include making appropriate amendments to existing forms of intellectual property rights ; implementing new administrative procedures ( for example , with regard to the patent application process ) ; and using alternative standard forms of legal protection rather than by legislation ( for example , material transfer agreements , biodiversity contracts and licencing agreements ) .  
Out of a total quantity of fissile material of weapons _ grade quality , which is estimated at roughly 2,000 tons , almost 1,400 tons constitute so _ called transitional material , in other words , declared or undeclared excess material .  
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
They expressed their grave concern at the renewed outbreak of hostilities in the Congo following the perpetration of acts of destabilization by armed groups , causing huge losses of life and material damage and hindering the implementation of commitments undertaken by the authorities to take measures to promote national reconciliation , rebuild the country and relaunch the democratic process .  
It was a timely initiative , particularly in the light of the growing threat of the use of nuclear or radioactive material by irresponsible individuals or groups .  
Hungary attached great importance to the adoption of the convention , since it would provide an excellent basis for proactive international cooperation , and hoped that it would serve as a deterrent and that some of its provisions would not have to be invoked , especially article 2 , paragraph 1 ( b ) concerning the actual use of radioactive material by terrorists . 
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
The definition of visual child pornography was to read as follows : Child pornography is the visual depiction of a child , real or simulated , engaged in explicit sexual activity , or the lewd exhibition of genitals , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material .  
The cantons were required to provide victims with access to independent public or private counselling centres whose task it was to offer medical , psychological , social , material and legal support and to give information on victim assistance .  
Pamphlets , brochures and wall charts on the impact of global conferences on quality of life ; development of technical notes , indicators , guidelines , and other material on selected themes , including good practices and success stories , relevant to integrated regional follow-up by the Arab States to United Nations global conferences ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
The Law on Social Care and Provision of Social Security of Serbia defines the family in the following manner : for the purposes of exercising the right to material support the family is understood to mean the spouses or two people of different sexes , children ( born in and out of wedlock , adopted or foster ) and kinsmen in the direct line and in the lateral line up to the second degree of kinship , provided they live in a common household .  
By enlisting enormous military might and by aerial bombardment of the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , its infrastructure and economic potentials , NATO has brazenly dropped more than 5,000 tons of the most destructive explosives and used cluster bombs banned by international law , causing enormous human casualties and vast material destruction .  
Since , in the situation of the incessant aggression of NATO and round-the-clock aerial bombardment , it is not possible at this moment to ascertain the exact scope of material and other damage and the number of people who lost their lives and were buried under the debris up until 18 April 1999 , only the damage and consequences eyewitnessed by the public , including numerous world media which reported them , are provided in the aide-mmoire .  
At the end of his testimony , each man requested that compensation be paid for the consequent material damage and mental suffering , as did all those others who attended the sessions of the Chamber in order to pursue civil claims .  
On the basis of the reports prepared by the technical experts and attached to the documentation , which set forth the material damage sustained by public and private installations in the two aforementioned cities ;  
In other words , a Government or a State should possess on a permanent basis , a legal system and material resources sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of [ its ] international obligations under normal conditions . 30 In particular , the State must have established , and maintain , an administrative apparatus that is minimally sufficient to permit it to fulfil those obligations ; 
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
insufficient supervision by the Public Prosecutor of the legality of and justification for prosecuting individuals , and detaining or arresting them or depriving them of their freedom leads to a situation in which the courts examine individual cases involving persons whose guilt has not been proven by material evidence , and the investigation of which is at times conducted in a superficial manner and without a detailed and critical analysis of the facts of the case .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
To re-establish , under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon states should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of source or special fissionable material or equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon States should require , as a necessary precondition , acceptance of the Agency 's full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapons States should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon States should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear explosive device .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The CANZ delegations would have expected any questions surrounding such material amounts to have been settled and appropriate adjustments made to the financial statements before the accounts were submitted to Member States : the problem of unliquidated obligations was not new , had been the subject of critical comment by the Board of Auditors and the Advisory Committee in the past and had a direct impact on the funds due to Member States whether as troop contributors or as recipients of credits .  
The first type is in terms of the gross output , based on its status and whether it is a final ( parliamentary services , published material , information materials and services , advisory services , training courses / seminars / workshops ) or an intermediate ( coordination , harmonization and liaison or international cooperation ) output .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
Grosso modo , the newcomers and their successors imbued ( and imbue ) the land with an essentially patrimonial value , making it subject to exclusive individual appropriation ( and , thus , capable of being passed on to others at the will of the title holder ) , a source of material wealth and a basis for political and economic power .  
Owing to their special relationship , spiritual and material , with their lands , the Special Rapporteur believes that very little or no progress can be made in this regard without tackling , solving and redressing - in a way acceptable to the indigenous peoples concerned - the question of their uninterrupted dispossession of this unique resource , vital to their lives and survival .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
The fundamental challenge facing this system is to provide targeted economic support for families facing material difficulties , to provide social assistance to single elderly people , particularly women , and to provide social and occupational rehabilitation for disabled people .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
The programme , which does away with any mutilation , encourages girls ready to assume their adult responsibilities to seclude themselves for a week during which they receive parts of the traditional education on their future roles as women plus more modern material on health , reproductive problems , effective means of communication , self _ respect and esteem and how to deal with problems they may encounter in their lives as women . 
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
Viewed from this perspective the FMT could capture in an irreversible way weapons material declared as excess in an ongoing process ; prevent altogether or regulate the further production of weapons _ grade materials for legitimate uses such as fuel for research reactors , naval reactors , etc . ; make closed _ down production and associated facilities subject to verification to prevent their reuse for weapons purposes .  
While recognizing the efforts made by the State party in the area of education , the Committee remains concerned at the high drop _ out rate for males in the upper grades of primary school , the poor reading ability or primary school males , the high incidence of truancy , lack of relevant learning material , insufficient numbers of trained and qualified teachers , and the tendency towards teaching methods that are almost exclusively exam oriented .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
Sectors that have been the main targets for recent anti-dumping actions are metals and metal products , chemical products , machinery and electrical equipment , plastics and plastic products , textiles and clothing , pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material , prepared foodstuffs and beverages , stone and plaster products , other manufactured products , footwear and headgear .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
Nigeria and indeed the entire West African subregion have devoted considerable human , material , political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of these crises in the subregion , starting with Liberia and subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Recalls the decision by the Conference on Disarmament2 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator3 and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Furthermore , bearing in mind both the emphasis placed in Council resolution 1996 / 31 on encouraging geographical diversity among NGOs and the large number of organizations with limited access to technology , the Section has devoted considerable effort to the production of informative written material and training workshops .  
The United Nations must provide some direction in the debate on the complex issues surrounding royalties for genetic material , and should help to fashion an international technological architecture that encouraged technological advances , but not at the cost of marginalizing the poorest and most vulnerable .  
His Governments long-term sustainable development strategies were aimed at upgrading the living standard of the citizens of Fiji , eradicating poverty , empowering women and youth , increasing employment and protecting the environment , in particular from land degradation and the trans-shipment of hazardous and toxic material across the oceans .  
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
To establish a single economic space in order to ensure socio-economic development on the basis of the united material and intellectual potential of the participating States and the use of market mechanisms for the functioning of the economy ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
In accordance with the rules governing international responsibility , we affirm the legally established right of the Republic of Iraq to seek compensation for all the losses , in terms of human , material and moral damage , that have been sustained by Iraq and its people owing to acts of aggression that are contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
The legal records of the trials in Cuba of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan nationals charged with being the material perpetrators of the offences give precise details of the premises , places , houses , hotels , restaurants , districts , towns , etc . , where the offences were planned and prepared and where the mercenaries were recruited , hired , trained and funded .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .

At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add , including public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
The plundering of the cultural heritage of Cyprus in this area has been so widespread that it led to a decision by the United States , a decision which we warmly welcome , to impose an emergency import restriction in April of this year on Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological material from Cyprus , unless such material is accompanied by an export permit issued by the Government of Cyprus .  
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
For the purposes of paragraph 2 ( d ) of principle 3 , the term made critical does not include actions such as zero-power testing which are fundamental to ensuring system safety.In order to minimize the quantity of radioactive material in space and the risks involved , the use of nuclear power sources in outer space shall be restricted to those space missions which can not be operated by non-nuclear energy sources in a reasonable way .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
In its report the Team presented the preliminary conclusion that the systematic massacre of those Rwandan Hutus ] remaining in Zaire was an abhorrent crime against humanity , but the underlying rationale for the decisions is material to whether these killings constituted genocide , that is to eliminate , in part , the Hutu ethnic group .  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
If current trends in energy and fossil fuel consumption continue , by 2010 global energy consumption and CO2 emissions will have risen by almost 50 per cent above 1993 levels . 11 There is general agreement that further increases in energy and material efficiency in production processes will need to be combined with shifts in consumption patterns towards goods and services that are inherently less energy and resource intensive if greenhouse gas emissions are to be stabilized . 
Many mercenaries who are experts in the use of explosives and technical devices with destructive material effects are hired to commit deadly attacks that cause collective fear and dread or , in other words , indiscriminate terror .  
In a noteworthy educational project that takes a holistic approach in addressing the needs of the internally displaced and host populations alike , the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) is developing a nationwide human rights education programme which will provide training and course material on human rights standards to all schools .  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
It called for parallel negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a comprehensive agreement banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices pursuant to paragraph 4 of the decision on Principles and objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
One of the principal characteristics of such an international instrument must be its non _ discriminatory nature in the sense that a uniform regime for strict international verification should be applied to all States and to all facilities capable of producing fissile material in all States without exception .  
On the other hand , such a treaty must be internationally and effectively verifiable , which means that the international instrument to be negotiated should be based on absolute transparency , which implies that all facilities anywhere in the world that are involved in the process of the production or storage of fissile material must be subject to a strict regime of control and inspection .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
Enhance the rapid deployment capacity of the Logistics Base by providing the best service possible to newly established peacekeeping missions and also to strengthen the logistics support of existing peacekeeping missions by taking action in a timely fashion on material release orders as follows : immediate operational requirements in 24 hours , urgent requests in 7 days and routine requests in 15 to 21 days ;  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The religious denominations and non _ traditional religious groups in Azerbaijan engage in charitable activities , assist a wide variety of communities , provide humanitarian assistance and visit boarding schools , homes for the disabled , hospitals and places of detention , providing material and moral support .  
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Although that countrys claim that the Sudan was supporting the northern resistance army continued to lack credible evidence , there was ample proof that the United States Government was providing material and financial assistance to the southern Sudanese rebel movement .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
We hope that we have all learned the lessons from events which have so seriously affected the country in human , material , psychological and other terms , and that we understand that war will always be a bad master and the worst choice .  
As a matter of definition of our priorities , we would prefer to devote greater political capital , as well as greater material resources , to conflict prevention and to supporting countries with unstable social , civil and economic structures .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
In those days of deep crisis , Pakistan extended moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country in defence of international law and morality as a sign of our solidarity with them in the hour of suffering .  
We believe that the international community and the countries of Africa first and foremost should help each other and provide financial , moral , material , intellectual and political resources to the Centre , whose work we consider beneficial .  
Equally important , the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of ongoing efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons and the need to ensure that excess fissile material is handled in a safe and effective way .  
This is a mass organization , whose main functions are to help take care of the material and spiritual life of older persons and to engage them in the political , social and cultural activities of the local community .  
By civilization , we mean an advanced level of intellectual , cultural and material development within a human society , featuring progress in the arts and sciences , the common use of writing and the emergence of complex political and social institutions .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification . 
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
That encouraging trend required adequate financial and material assistance as well as the political and moral support of the international community .  
During the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Pakistan extended unequivocal moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country , in defence of international law and morality and as proof of our solidarity with them .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
When data can be identified and controlled by a particular data carrier , such as data stored on a ( set of ) floppy disks they can , from a legal point of view , be considered one tangible material object .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
Food , shelter or any other basic material need of the individual can be satisfied through coercive means , including rationing , and economies can be prosperous in terms of investment , production and growth in a totalitarian political context .  
Starting materials designated to be of pharmacopoeial quality should meet the respective requirements before the material can be labelled and accepted for the intended pharmaceutical use ;  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
In the future , combating racial discrimination would be more difficult as it would be expressed less and less in crude forms of colour discrimination , but rather would be combined with class and other material conditions .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
His delegation looked forward to the resumption and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a binding universal legal instrument banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The Russian Federation was contributing to the technical development of safeguards through a national support programme aimed at improving analytical methods , modernizing the technical means employed , and producing and certifying samples of nuclear material .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Pakistan extended unequivocal moral , political , financial and material support to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in defence of international law and morality and as proof of our solidarity with them .  
The international community should make any assistance political , diplomatic , financial , material or military to parties to armed conflict contingent on their observing standards for the protection of children .  
Although scientific and technological progress is being made and material wealth is being accumulated , technological symposiums and other activities reaching broad sectors of the population are needed if the desired level of development is to be attained .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
The distressing feature of the First and Second World Wars was that they made use of the advanced technologies of the late nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century to cause enormous human and material devastation .  
The Committee notes with concern that children living in the outer islands do not have adequate access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources aimed at promoting the childs development and physical and mental health .  
Mr . Salman ( Iraq ) affirmed that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq constituted an example of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment and of violence against men , women and children who had sustained considerable material and physical suffering .  
Investment in conflict prevention should be seen as our premium for a secure future , a future insured against the costs of war financial , human and material a future assured of shared security instead of a shared burden .  
Likewise , the political support of the United Nations in this case , the Security Council and the provision of material and technical assistance by the international community are essential for the successful implementation of the ECOWAS initiative to deploy a multinational ECOWAS Monitoring Group force along the borders of Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .  
We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .  
We also called for an overhaul of this regime to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people by enabling Iraq to import all its basic humanitarian needs , medical supplies , foodstuffs and educational material , without requiring the prior consent of the Council .  
My delegation would like to join in the unanimous tribute to the French delegation for its work in presiding over the Council last month and to congratulate it for the outstanding way in which it handled the tragic events that plunged the United States of America and the world into mourning as a result of the horrendous attacks on New York , Washington D.C . and Pennsylvania , which caused incalculable human and material loss .  
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .  
His Government attached great importance to the material and spiritual lives of its people , and since 1986 , it had been encouraging the expansion of different economic sectors ; that policy had resulted in the growth of a national economy and had established the countrys legislative foundation as reflected in the 1991 adoption of its first Constitution and in other instruments .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
Consequently , the Council , in its resolution 724 ( XXVIII ) of 17 July 1959 , requested the Secretary-General to inform the IAEA of its desire that the IAEA be entrusted with the drafting of recommendations on the transport of radioactive material , on the understanding that these recommendations would be consistent with the principles adopted by the Committee and that they would be established in consultation with the United Nations and the specialized agencies concerned .  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
In addition to the continued unity of effort of its components , in close cooperation with KFOR , in the crucial period in the run-up to elections , the Mission will require the ongoing support of its activities by the international community , including material support , and , above all , the strong and committed support it has enjoyed from members of the Security Council and Member States since its inception .  
The simple fact that a particular category of the population suffers from underprivileged economic or social conditions does not mean that , in order to upgrade its material position , any distinction based on a characteristic defining the group should be considered legitimate , even if the ground is irrelevant as a basis of distinction with regard to a particular right .  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
The Unit otherwise supports the work of NGOs by disseminating international human rights promotional and training material and developing a mechanism through which information collated and analysed by the Unit and East Timorese NGOs will be preserved and accessible for future use .  
They urged that Israel should be required to pay reparations for the material losses resulting from its aggression against the occupied Palestinian territories , such as the destruction of urban and rural installations , as well as for the many Palestinian lives that have been lost , the serious wounds that have been inflicted and the permanent disabilities that have been caused , as has been the case in the past when compensation has been paid to victims of aggression in similar cases . 
A possible strategy is to establish such a capacity gradually , by assisting in developing requisite training / pedagogical material and by providing assistance in course delivery in a developing country on a regional basis jointly with local professional associations ( freight forwarders , exporters etc . ) and / or academic institutions .  
Quoting rule 4 of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities , 4 the Committee stated that , in addition to the need to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to adequate food , accessible housing and other basic material needs , it was also necessary to ensure that support services , including assisting devices were available for persons with disabilities , so as to assist them in increasing their level of independence in their daily life and in exercising their rights .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .  
Among such steps are the strengthening of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards , revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material , improving national standards of security and physical protection of nuclear material , establishing stronger regulatory control over radioactive sources and enhancing international cooperation against illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
Cuba was very familiar with international terrorism , since for over 40 years it had been a victim of countless terrorist activities instigated from abroad , which had caused substantial material losses and loss of life and inflicted incalculable suffering on Cuban citizens .  
The provision of $ 1,649,200 would provide for specialized contractual security training and the production of publications considered essential for the success of functioning of the new security management system , including : ( a ) requirements of $ 1,270,000 for security , emergency , stress management and other specialized training to be organized through specific seminars and courses , including the preparation of related training material , and ( b ) requirements of $ 379,200 for production of the Security Handbook in all official languages and the periodic reprinting of various updated security materials .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
To date , conventions have been developed covering the safety of power reactors , radioactive waste and spent fuel management , early notification and assistance in case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency , and the physical protection of nuclear material .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
If the Agency were unable effectively to track the location and use of nuclear material worldwide , or to give adequate support to national nuclear safety measures , the consequences to the global community could be grave .  
Other requirements in the amount of $ 150,000 would provide for conversion of public information material to HTML for web sites in six official languages ; production of TV and radio products ; public information production costs for translation into local languages and events organized at the national / regional level by United Nations information centres ; the follow-up of the outcome of the Assembly ; the production of press kits ; update of the 1999 Ageing exhibit and production of two banners at the Assembly site .  
Ensure the selection , acquisition and maintenance of documents and publications regarding international law , international legal material , humanitarian law and national law relevant to the operations of the Tribunal for the use of judges , staff and defence counsel ; and provide online information services to assist staff , in particular the legal officers and judges , with legal research and greater access to bibliographic information ; ( b ) Conference and language support activities :  
The provision relates to special conservation , treatment and safe storage of organic and non-organic material gathered by the Investigations Division as evidence from mass grave sites , buried possessions and decrepit archival facilities .  
The new team will collect and analyse material related to the remaining incidents expected to lead to formal investigations and assist in evaluating numerous allegations received by the Office of the Prosecutor in areas where no investigation has been opened yet , including preliminary work in southern Serbia and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .

second , it is even more difficult to do this because we are confronted with the new situation characterized by the new scientific and technological revolution in the 21st century and the fierce competition worldwide , with a serious challenge from our double mission to achieve China 's modernization , and with the magnificent task of building a socialist material civilization and a socialist spiritual civilization .  
Capitalism has developed over 300 years , accumulated rich experience , developed a solid material basis , and established relatively mature economic and legal systems .

With this as the foundation , China 's largest explosion suppression materials production base has begun to be established in Shantou City , Guangdong Province . When phase one goes into production , it will have a yearly production capacity of 10,000 tons of explosion suppressing material .  
We must base ourselves on the new practice of social life today and on the new development of the times , strengthen theoretical study , conscientiously sum up the experience , tackle problems in real earnest , make explorations in the midst of practice , make innovations in the midst of explorations , and move forward in the midst of innovations .  While doing a better job in the building of material civilization , we must keep pushing ahead with the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
We must learn from their love of their jobs and respect for their occupations , consciously standing in the front ranks of the construction of material and cultural / ideological progress , bringing the vanguard model functions into full play in each job with a solemn sense of mission and an intense sense of responsibility , striving to get ahead and making first-rate achievements in the course of reforms , opening up , and modernization .

The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
The hosting of the Olympic Games and entry to the World Trade Organization are bound to redouble the strength of the Chinese economy , which is already developing in a sound and rapid manner .

Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .

Instead , the province has included public order , production , transit , ships , ports , and military facilities in coastal areas into the land-sea-air comprehensive management system .  
It was an important material foundation for economic growth , technological progress , and social stability in the developed countries after World War II , where lay the crucial reason for the economic backwardness and social poverty of developing countries .  
China 's overall national strength has been greatly increased , and the people 's material and cultural life enhanced .  China has also greatly raised its international status .  To uphold the Party 's absolute leadership over the army in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents , " we must even more unswervingly uphold the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core .  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;

In a modern war where the use of force sees no bounds , the weak are still nations outside of the West , because the Western nations so far are in control of the initiative for technological and scientific advancements and the resulting military advantages .  In a war where the two opposite sides have no rules but make massacre their ultimate goal , the victor will still be the side with technology and material superiority .  
In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
The main factors constraining Russia 's industrial structural adjustment include , firstly , the government 's " passive adaptation " policy .  To fight crises , Russia has been tilted in favor of advantage-enjoying energy and raw material industries in terms of the direction of investment and exports .  This has unavoidably further worsened the already-deformed heavy-light structure .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .  
The sustained and rapid growth of the past 20 years has laid down a comparatively solid material and technological foundation for the giant advance of infrastructure construction , particularly in the fields of communications , telecommunications , energy , and so on , and has augmented the reserved strength of economic development .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
In the past 50 years since the founding of new China , especially in the past 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the level of the people 's material and cultural life has constantly been raised , and the human rights cause , being a part of these achievements , has also made comprehensive and concrete progress personally experienced by the Chinese people on the basis of the constant development of the economy in China .

Existing provincial specialized economic administrative departments in charge of industry , commerce , and material supply will be dissolved and reorganized into seven asset management companies respectively in charge of machine-building , metallurgical industry , light industry , petrochemical industry , defense industry , trade , and building materials .  
In addition , the words and deeds that we have seen tell us very specifically that they are not trying out the possibility of " Taiwan independence , " nor are they running around in circles and lacking material and mental preparations ; instead they are engaged in close coordination inside and outside the island , have undertaken meticulous study and arrangements , and are methodically and persistently advancing along the path of " Taiwan independence " with greatly enhanced confidence and patience plus will-power .  
Our party has devoted herself to the development of both advanced social productive forces and an advanced culture with a view to meeting the people 's and masses ' growing material and cultural needs and realizing or safeguarding the fundamental interests of the largest majority of the people .  
He added that apart from the gradual improvement in material conditions , a good academic research environment should include an institutional environment for scientific research , a humanistic environment , a good atmosphere for academic discussion , and harmonious interpersonal relationships .  
Public security organs of all levels gave play to their role of being the main force in cracking down on the crime of making and selling counterfeit money .

Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
since our party represents the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , it must persistently take Marxism as the guide , inherit and develop all fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation , study and absorb all the fruits of human civilization , and continually build and create socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , so that material and spiritual civilization will develop in coordinated fashion and promote the all-round progress of society ;  
under the guidance of Marxism , to constantly build and develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture with Chinese characteristics that is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future so as to bring about coordinated development of the socialist material and spiritual civilizations and promote comprehensive social progress ;  
Thirdly , the ultimate goal of our efforts to liberate and develop our productive forces and to build a socialist spiritual civilization is to satisfy the people 's growing material demands in their everyday life , that is , to better represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses and serve them wholeheartedly .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
and further deepened its understanding of China 's basic national condition .  It proposed : The main social contradiction is the one between the increasing material cultural needs of the people and the backward social productive forces .  This main contradiction runs through the whole process of the initial stage of socialism and all aspects of social life .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
The successful practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the liveliest and most convincing teaching material , and the various advanced individuals who emerged from among us and their advanced and typical deeds are the liveliest and most current and brilliant teaching materials .  We must carry out education in ideals and conviction with perfect assurance and push ahead socialist civilization building unwaveringly .  
The leadership collective of the third generation of the party with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has all the more attached importance to and strengthened the building of socialist spiritual civilization , made continuous new advances in this aspect while persisting in taking economic construction as the center and paying close attention to the building of material civilization , and clearly and definitely set and gradually and systematically expounded the task of building a culture with Chinese characteristics .  
In close connection with the changes in the internal and external situation , with the reality of the latest development of China 's social productive forces and the profound changes in the economic system , with the demands of the masses for new development in material and cultural life , and with the new conditions and changes in the ranks of party members and cadres , we should ponder in depth how to adhere still better to the " three represents , " and make efforts to find answers from linking theory with reality .  
Hu Kangsheng said : To amend the Marriage Law , we should proceed from China 's actual conditions , uphold the socialist marriage and family system , adhere to practicing the marriage system in terms of freedom of marriage , monogamy , and equality of men and women , maintain the equal , harmonious , and civilized matrimonial family relationship , safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of women , children , and the aged , and give an impetus to the building of socialist material and spiritual civilizations .

When touching on utilizing domestic and international resources and on striving to tap domestic and international markets , Wu Yi emphasized the need for localities to encourage , promote , and assist potential and outstanding enterprises to invest in and operate plants abroad , and to engage in product assembling and in raw material processing .  
All localities and all military units should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central ideological and political work conference .  They should launch the activities of building spiritual civilization through the joint efforts of servicemen and civilians and promote coordinated development of spiritual and material civilization .  
Jiang Zemin viewed with great interest the materials , parts , components , and mechanical and electrical products turned out by the machine-building , metallurgical , nonferrous , petrochemical , light , textile and building material industries , the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Ministry of Education , and other departments , listened to briefings by scientific research personnel , and asked in detail about some of the production and technical problems .  
At the exhibition , Zhu Rongji pored over materials , parts , components , and mechanical and electrical products developed and manufactured by the machinery , metallurgical , nonferrous , petrochemical , light , textile , and building material industries , the Chinese Academy of Sciences , and universities in cooperation with the defense industry ; and listened to briefings by exhibition personnel .  
Labor models and advanced workers are the outstanding representatives of China 's working class and millions upon millions of the laboring masses .  They are the vanguards of the building of material and spiritual civilization .  Their advanced thinking and exemplary deeds fully manifest the lofty style and spirit of China 's working class .  
On the other hand , in recent years , some local public security organs have concentrated on the building of a material civilization to the neglect of the building of a spiritual civilization and have overlooked and slackened their efforts in promoting their ideological and political work .  
Summing up experiences of the past few years , the reason why we have been able to withstand the tests in the face of huge difficulties and have also grasped the momentum and achieved outstanding success is , first of all , because the active and steady progress of the reforms and opening up of the past 20 years , the rapid development of the national economy , and the marked increase in comprehensive national strength have laid a relatively sound material and technical foundation for withstanding and resisting dangers .  
The film exposes the disgraceful end of certain leading cadres who are unable to withstand the lure of desire for material things , fall into the abyss of evil , and embark on the path of crime , and reveals the ugly ways of corrupt elements in going all-out to rig up a network of connections , open a breach through people at the side of the leaders , and end up by dragging the leading cadres into the water .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : All the work of the party and the state is for the fundamental purpose of satisfying the people 's daily increasing needs in their material and cultural life and improving their living standards .  
In order to realize the grand goal of modernization , solve contradictions and problems in economic and social life and satisfy the increasing material and cultural needs of the broad masses of people , we must maintain a relatively fast speed in development .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
Although the Chinese government insists that the Taiwan question brooks no intervention and has taken retaliatory action against European countries that sold advanced arms to Taiwan with satisfactory results , it is reluctant to take action to stop the United States from overtly calling for the maintenance of the status quo while covertly supporting " Taiwan independence , " because it is aware of its substantial gap with the United States in economic and military strength and has to take care of its economic development and improve the material life of its people .  
China will greatly promote the strategic readjustment of its economic structure , accelerate the computerization of the national economic and social sectors , greatly develop science , education , and cultural undertakings , step up developing such new and high technologies like information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , and advanced manufacturing technology , further step up infrastructure building in water conservancy , communications , and energy , and intensify efforts on ecological building and environmental protection .  
During an interview given to reporters from inside and outside the border , Xi Jinping said that the broad ranks of people in Taiwan had a strong desire for " three exchanges " across the strait some time ago .

The authorities have confirmed from both the human testimony and material evidence available that Li Jizhou is a suspect who has taken a huge amount of bribes by abusing his power through shielding smuggling ; issuing licenses to smuggled vehicles ;  
During his period in office in Guangxi , as a high-ranking cadre , he used the advantages afforded by his powers to pursue private interests and illegally received huge amounts of money and material from others ; the case was particularly bad and seriously infringed on the honesty of state work personnel 's duties , and ruined the reputation of the party and government ; he is a typical corrupt element .  
First of all , we should do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the priority tasks , concentrate our financial and material resources on solving major problems that concern the overall development of the western region , and promote a comprehensive economic and social development .  
Agricultural departments at all levels and the vast numbers of agricultural scientific and technological personnel should go deep down to the forefront of production , help peasants fight droughts and ensure a successful spring sowing , see to a sound implementation of material and technological measures , pay close attention to the work of demonstration by example , guarantee the smooth progress of spring production , and lay a solid foundation for next year 's agricultural production .  
At this critical juncture , when China is moving from the 20th century toward the 21st century , we must make material progress and cultural and ideological progress a uniform goal to strive for , unfailingly insisting on concentrating on both aspects .  We must put comprehensive social development in a strategic position , achieving the mutually-coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society .  
For example , people may have strong material desires , may pursue money fetishism and hedonism , may become hasty in unscrupulously seeking instant successes and gains , may become vulgar and fall short of lofty ideals and beliefs , may become hypocritical and fall short of sound personality , may act in a double-dealing way , and may even behave in a disorderly way without regard to law and order .  
The most fundamental experience in achieving tremendous successes in reform and opening up in the past 20 years and more is that at all time and under all circumstances , we have regarded whether or not what we are doing conforms with the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as the highest standard in all our work , and have regarded meeting the growing needs of the material and cultural life of the people and improving the living standards of the people as the most important task .  
The session held that continually improving the material and cultural living standards of people in urban and rural areas is the starting and end point of economic development .  
In order to boost economic development and restructuring , it is necessary to rely on institutional innovations and scientific and technological innovations .  The continuous improvement of the people 's material and cultural life is the ultimate goal of economic development .  
The development of the eastern regions has been and remains an extremely important force in supporting the overall national economy in finance , material , and technology , and is also an indispensable condition for supporting the western development and the accelerated development of central and west China .  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .  
Under such circumstances , international criminal cliques have adopted more concealed and roundabout smuggling tactics .  For example , the illegal immigrants captured by Hong Kong this time were arranged by criminals in Hong Kong . They falsely reported the material inside the containers .  
We must make the development of material progress and cultural and ideological progress a unified fighting goal , always concentrating on both jobs and attaching equal importance to both to satisfy the ever-growing , multifaceted cultural and ideological needs of the people , achieving an overall improvement in the quality of the people and enhancing national solidarity .

This is the first time that advanced productive forces and advanced culture , that is , material and spiritual civilization , have been scientifically and dialectically linked to the fundamental interests of the people , and that advanced nature and the fundamental interests of the people have been unified in the people 's historic practice .  
conscientiously uphold the principle of " attending to two types of work [ the building of a material civilization and a spiritual civilization ] simultaneously , attaching equal importance of both " ; effect temporary as well as permanent solutions to existing problems , and intensify their efforts in eliminating the root causes of these problems ; and further promote , in a deep-going manner , the government 's work of building an uncorrupted administration and fighting against corruption .  
Liu Guoguang , a famous economist and special adviser to the Chinese Academy of Social Science , holds that , looking at the favorable aspects , China has abundant labor resources and a relatively high savings rate ; as a result of several decades of large-scale construction , especially since the launch of reform and opening up , China 's economic strength has been greatly enhanced , thus laying a relatively strong material basis for future development ;

Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
We stress the importance of unleashing and developing productive forces and building an advanced culture , but the purpose of all this is , in the final analysis , to realize , develop , and safeguard the people 's interests and continuously meet the ever-increasing material and cultural demands of the general public .  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
and great achievements have been made in the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization .

Judged from what has been reflected by the grassroots , right now there are too many inspections , conferences , social etiquette , and functions of all kinds , and they are very time-consuming and high-class .  Consequently , huge manpower and material resources have been wasted .  All levels of leading cadres , who find it hard to cope with , have poured out endless grievances .  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
We will not merely stay at the growth of per capita income but , more importantly , make efforts in numerous areas including the consumption structure , living environment , social security , public services , medical treatment and healthcare , spiritual demands , and so on so that the material , spiritual , and cultural demands of the vast number of people are satisfied as much as possible , and their quality in life is improved .

Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide .

For example , every time he heard tell of a construction project going on within the range of the ruins , Tacheng Middle School teacher Chien Shih-lang would grab a metal screen and head for the dirt pile to " search for treasure , " sifting out from the dirt pile shards of stone coffin and other objects stirred up by the backhoes and arranging them in separate bags . He saved them , both as a record of local history and also as classroom material of local interest .  
In addition , and more worthy of attention , a number of jade pendants and other decorative objects made from " Taiwan soft jade " have been found at Tamalin . A large amount of jade craft waste material has also been found . This situation resembles that uncovered in Wanjung Rural Township in Hualien , which is known as a " jade handicraft site " of prehistoric people .  
The material most often used to simulate bronze is fiber-reinforced plastic with a coat of metallic paint . But this would not be realistic enough , and after some time the paint would begin to flake off . For better effect , Lin Chien-cheng added powdered metal to an acid - and alkali-resistant , non-oxidizing resin which he formed manually into the shapes required . He then polished them to create an effect which really does look completely like bronze .  
" Assuming that the initial French recording process was in violation of the law , then all future uses of this unauthorized material , including those by Enigma and the IOC , would all be unlawful as well , " explains Huang Hsiu-lan , Difag 's attorney , in a firm tone of voice . She has received approval from Difag to use " the most intensive legal methods " to handle the case .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
Most importantly , nearly every " big-name teacher " in the buxiban business had a set of gimmicks to sort out major points and condense the teaching material . They were able to arrange textbooks ' important details into compartmentalized lectures . Using all kinds of special techniques like " association " and outlines , they could actually ram the crucial points of exams into the students ' brains , and as an extra , they could spin off terse and witty jokes .  
Everyone says the generation of Taiwanese now about 30 are lucky , blessed by economic development and social affluence . From a material standpoint , we are indeed lucky , but from a psychological standpoint , we grew up during Taiwan 's period of greatest change , when political , social and even family structures were disintegrating , when value systems were confused . These changes caused many frustrations , and often left us feeling lost and powerless , not knowing how , in this messed-up age , to peacefully stake out a life for ourselves .  
The electricity runs through the circuits like the transmitting material in the human nervous system , which allows the brain to remember , select , calculate , and even listen , speak , read , and write , undertaking all kinds of " intelligent " tasks . The applications of the flow of electric current in a circuit are virtually limitless :  
Such endings are both happy and tragic , for they never go outside the conventional standards of life in the material world . Even today , many parents are tied to the notion that " in books one will naturally find a face as pretty as jade , " and admonish their children to " study hard-once you pass the exams and get into university , there 'll be plenty of pretty girls ! "  
Compared with the lonely pines standing among great mountains and ageless rivers , the material aspirations of the human world are transitory and fleeting . As life and history pass , even the greatest sorrows will be wiped away . When we humans see how nature is unconcerned at our troubles , our own mood in the face of adversity or disaster may be calmed : what is owned may be lost , and the present may pass-one need only seek compensation in one 's own soul .  
Sogyal Rinpoche is the spiritual heir of an ancient lineage of teachers reaching back several centuries . But he has lived for many years amidst modern society , which is rich in material assets , but whose people are confused and perplexed . In his eyes , most people misuse life and misunderstand death : " Death in fact is a great opportunity . Only when we understand death can we know how to live . "  
He compares how in both Mayan culture ( or the New World generally ) and Chinese culture ( or the Old World generally ) , the newly arising class societies were based on religious ritual . Their highly developed writing systems and beautiful sacrificial objects were used in the service of religion and politics , whereas the tools they used for material production had not advanced beyond the stone implements used in prehistoric times .  
To the immediate right are densely packed grey residential buildings and high-rises in the downtown . Electrical power stations and petrochemical and metal industry plants are crowded along the coast and the Kaoping River . Oil tanks , incinerator towers , and smokestacks look like pillars to a wall surrounding the city . To the left is a low mountain , which has been half shaved away for material to make concrete ; bald and grey , it has an eerie appearance .  
The desire of " civilized " humanity for material goods is insatiable . Man is also the only animal to have developed commerce . Ivory has been a common raw material since the earliest days of markets , and its consumption has grown continuously .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
Li Chin-kuo , a graduate of the Institute of Zoology at National Taiwan University , has always been concerned about wildlife . After the FS Studio class , he used the limited amount of money that he had been able to save during his compulsory military service to buy a digital video camera and a second-hand car , and headed off to fishing villages in search of material .  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
Laozi says of the Way : " There was something composed of many things , before heaven and earth were born . " The Way existed before the material world , and seems to move in a never-ending cycle characterized by " departing , becoming distant and returning . " It is an invisible and unceasing motive force within the universe , and the real creator and mover of all visible , physical things .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
The lower end of the neck on each of the heads ends in a pointed diamond shape , suggesting that the heads were all mounted on bodies made of some other material , and that they were arranged in solemn majesty around an altar , with the big bronze statue standing in the center . After the sacred rite was completed , the beautifully crafted statues and ceremonial implements were burnt , broken , and placed in the pit . Why would anyone have done this ?  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
The scrap contained large amounts of insulation material made of plastics containing chlorine , so burning it produced highly toxic dioxin . The stench from the fires forced pupils at the nearby Nanning Junior High School to wear cotton face masks to school , and there were high rates of respiratory tract diseases among local residents .  
From Arabic literature 's Aladdin to the native American tale of Pocahontas , from The Hunchback of Notre Dame , steeped in Gallic ambience , to Hercules , rooted in Greek and Roman mythology , Disney has long sought out material with a world-wide appeal . Seeking a feeling of intimacy and a clear delineation between good and evil , their animated features employ fables and animals to dissolve the cultural barriers that lie hidden under their auras of exoticism .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
On September 25 , the Executive Yuan met in extraordinary session to invoke emergency powers , define the boundaries of the disaster area and , for a limited period , suspend various laws and regulations that limit the central government 's discretionary authority over public expenditures , land appropriation , government procurement , and the use of material and equipment belonging to government agencies . The aim was to cut through red tape which could potentially obstruct disaster relief and reconstruction work .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
This outstanding editor had his own conception of modern Chinese history , and a unique understanding of where to go , who to seek out , what to ask them to write about and how it should be written . No wonder , then , that he never felt able to pass on the heavy burden of editorship , or that right up until he finally succumbed to his illness he was still reviewing articles , and left behind enough publication-ready material to fill several issues .  
" Historical truth " is of course a fascinating topic of its own . While Biographical Literature has had an unmatched impact on contemporary historians , on popular interest in history , and in capturing the flavor of the past , there is at least one point worth wondering about : It has rarely published any material about Taiwan over the last 50 years , such as the stories of the opposition movement or of well-connected families like the Lins or Koos .  
It 's a chicken-and-egg problem . The best work that appears in Biographical Literature are the stories written by participants in history themselves . Each time there were power shifts in Republican era , another group of elites was washed out ; later , settled in Taiwan and far removed from day-to-day politics , they were willing to write for the magazine . Being good writers with broad perspectives , naturally they produced exciting and engrossing material , which , by keeping the standards of the magazine up , attracted more of the same .  
Lin Neng-jong , director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development . Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and-except for fishing products-other materials all have to be imported . Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms . In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .  
Jade has always been close to the hearts of the Chinese , and while glass was a glittering and translucent material in the West , inspired by precious stones of varying colors , in China it developed primarily as a jade substitute , having a soft , opaque texture .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei-fei , " Wang notes . " Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly . " Moreover , she has had the right material , with producer Peter Li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde . This has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace .  
Happy , because in the past century Taiwan has not directly experienced a major war , its economy and society have advanced steadily , and our living environment has continuously improved . Today 's Taipei is like any international city-modern and convenient , with most everything one needs in terms of daytime activities , nightlife , and material and spiritual culture .  
Lin remarks that a 40% cut for the franchisor is reasonable since Wayoung started out as a material supplier , specializing in importing activated charcoal reverse osmosis filters , which are the key component for purifying water .  
In the novel , humans have long since created intelligent computers , the Earth is in the complete control of a cosmic computer alliance , all material needs are met , the genetic codes of all organisms have been fully decoded , the human dream of eternal youth has been realized , and humans can acquire all kinds of knowledge at any time through the network communication systems that they carry with them .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
In fact , the Council of Agriculture normally forbids the artificial breeding and sale of protected species , for fear that inbreeding will damage the wild gene pool . But with the resurgence of dengue fever , and with people 's enthusiasm for repopulating Taiwan 's rivers with the indigenous paradise fish , conservation agencies merely suggest that breeders should enlarge their sources of genetic material , to avoid narrowing the fishes ' gene pool .  
With these two types of sustenance , one material and one spiritual , naturally one can live a long time , " says Lu . In fact , as long ago as the Song dynasty , Su Dongpo had identified three major advantages of eating zhou : " It brings peace of mind , which contributes to well-being , it is easy on the stomach , which contributes to physical energy , and it saves money , which contributes to becoming wealthy . "  
Once you reduce its thickness to 50 nanometers , light can easily pass through it , so that it no longer reflects light . Its color changes from gold to red , and it becomes an excellent material for pregnancy test kits . Once gold is manufactured as thin as 50 nanometers , it goes from being extremely stable to being extremely volatile , allowing it to be used in many different applications as a catalyst or activator .  
Theoretically , composite ceramic molecules laid at thicknesses of 10 to 30 nanometers will emit infrared waves at the most ideal wavelength for keeping food fresh . Currently , industry has attained levels of 70-90 nanometers . The refrigerators employ a coating of this material on aluminum trays to keep fish fresh , and also on a carpet-like material to line the compartments for fruit and vegetables . They are quite effective .  
Yang once decided to grind pearl down to nano levels , and discovered that he had destroyed the amino acid , releasing a foul odor and ruining the raw material .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
For one thing , he says , the raw material for lacquer ware is made from the sap of any of various species of lacquer tree and is poisonous in its natural form . Contact with the skin or ingestion will , in mild cases , cause swelling and extreme itchiness of the arms . Persons with a low tolerance level will experience general swelling and suffer from symptoms akin to poison ivy . If scratching leads to infection , the victim will puff up all over like a big balloon .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
Pots made from blackish ash-colored clay are also few in number , but they too have some special characteristics . The jars and vases have small mouths and big bellies . The material is of very fine quality and the exterior surfaces have undergone smoothing and polishing . There are broken lines and circles on the exterior surfaces of the " shoulder " portion , and these decorative line patterns normally encircle the outside of the vessel .  
Nautica won the affections of consumers with an appreciation for quality-made athletic clothing . Customers were first allured by the clothing 's colorful vitality and the unaffected simplicity of the design . However , upon further inspection they would discover that the clothing was very practical , as well . From the material and the tailoring work , to the location of the pockets and the adjustable sleeves , all the way down to minute details like the size of the zipper , Nautica 's quality was immediately self-evident .  
In addition to writing , he quietly produced Wenyou Tongxun , a periodical that kept alive the flickering flame of " homegrown " literature by gathering together and publishing works by scattered Nativist writers . Not everyone writing under the banner of anti-Communist literature in its heyday produced hackneyed material .  
In Taiwanese society at large , everyone has gained the right to freedom of expression and is able to criticize publicly the political situation , even the president and high officials . Within the literary field , a myriad of new directions have opened up . Aboriginal literature , new feminist literature , environmental literature , gay literature , and pornographic literature have taken the stage one after another , providing material for readers of every taste .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .  
Huang had the material made into underwear and after wearing if for two months noticed a gradual improvement in her gastric ulcer problem . Although at that time she remained skeptical she decided to make two new items after which the improvement in her health became much more pronounced . In January 1994 , Huang visited a professor at Tsinghua University in the hope of becoming an agent for the sale of the technology that had helped her so much .  
By way of contrast , he mentions Bertelsmann of Germany . Bertelsmann is trying to get into the mainland market through distribution , marketing , and sales . Although they already have agreement from " the highest levels , " they are still moving cautiously . They do n't sell any books of a " sensitive nature " ( such as histories that show the present in an unflattering or derisive light , risque material , or books that test the margins of permissible speech ) .  
" But when they reached middle age , and their material dreams were satisfied , they felt spiritual emptiness , as a result of which many turned to dissipated lifestyles , extramarital affairs , and religious escapism , " says Wang Chung-kwei , chairman of the Department of Psychology at Soochow University , who is a long-time student of generational differences in Taiwan . This is one reason why spiritual and religious topics have garnered so much attention in Taiwan in recent years .  
However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
A loose hat flies up into the air , and someone curious to see how a helicopter delivers construction material is forced by the strong wind and sand kicked up by the helicopter to squint as , eyes barely open , he watches the helicopter as it lowers heavy solar panels to the ground and then flies off in the direction of Taoshan .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
the session decided to approve the inclusion of the project in the ten year program for national economic and social development , and authorize the state council to carry it out at an appropriate time , in light of the actual development of the national economy and the country 's financial and material force  
A number of delegations stated that this database on human rights source material should be guided by the principles of indivisibility of all human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .  
$ 17,500 , at maintenance level , for overtime and night service differential to retain clerical and distribution staff , and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
The procedure for valuing the movable and immovable property lost by refugees and persons subjected to forced resettlement , assessing material losses and paying compensation shall be determined jointly by the Parties concerned .  
Its recent expansion from 3 to 10 full members makes ECO a major regional grouping and an important international entity with vast combined potential in terms of material and human resources .  
In order to achieve the required level of services , enhanced coordination and technological innovation were indispensable , but equally essential was the provision of adequate human and material resources .  
Because of the physical nature of such material , the uncontrolled movement of nuclear material , in conjunction with the interests of organized crime , creates favourable conditions for the production of the socalled personal weapons of mass destruction .  
The collector system , to be operational in a highpressure and lowtemperature environment while operating on soil of poor strength , demands special equipment components and material which need to be tested in the actual deep seabed environment .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
Improvement of the quality of life in the ESCWA region , encompassing material and nonmaterial aspects , is closely correlated with proper management of natural resources and economic development .  
I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
The efforts of a United Nations Member in environmental protection have been reduced to those at the national level and it has been left to rely on its own modest material and human resources .  
The need to develop innovative material for use at the primary and secondary school levels , within universities and in professional training , especially for the judiciary , law enforcement officials , the military , and medical and social workers ;  
Improving the reliability , utility and public availability of statistical and other information material on social development , including on gender issues , at the national , regional and international levels .  
Those services , which included advice and material assistance , were provided through social welfare ministries and bodies , and were not only offered at the national level , but also extended to friendly and fraternal States .  
As poverty was both a material and an immaterial disadvantage , the aim should be to raise income and to promote the development of the full potential of the individual and the participation of the underprivileged in social , political and economic decisions .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
At the end of this twentieth century , thanks to mankind 's achievements in science and technology and in communication and production , and thanks also to the hard work of all nations , our world as a whole has become more prosperous and more alive , with the manifold increase in material and non-material flows and exchanges , thus facilitating better mutual understanding and closer relationships among nations .  
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
African countries have committed themselves repeatedly to carry out far-reaching economic and institutional reforms , on the express understanding that their efforts would be fully complemented by the requisite material support of the international community , particularly the advanced countries .  
At the same time , the General Assembly must always be solicitous of this principal organ when it comes to preserving the dignity of eminent international judges and their staff and when human and material resources are required to enhance the efficacy of this institution and to promote good and diligent administration of international justice .  
In particular , the Secretariat would be requested to provide orally an estimate of the cost of the relevant document before it is demanded by Member States , stricter page limits would be established , oral reports would be encouraged , the Secretariat would be asked to consolidate reports on related topics , repetitive historical material would be eliminated and the use of paperless technology would be promoted .  
Regrettably , this great historic victory was attained at a high price : the heavy of loss of human lives , incredible suffering , unprecedented material losses .  
Our Government , headed by His Excellency Joaqu \ x { 74af } Balaguer , and the people that I represent join in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , and share the hope that the Organization 's efforts and successes will continue to increase in the continuing search for a just , united , common and fraternal humanity , sharing the material and spiritual assets of a civilization that can lead us to see people as part of a common humanity .  
Notwithstanding the impressive achievements of the human race we are forced to live at the same time with unspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual progress in which we might feel some pride as we approach the new century .  
Further , as effective national accounting and protection is the basic prerequisite for preventing nuclear material from falling into unauthorized hands , the Agency is conducting training courses in the implementation of State systems of accounting and control of nuclear material and in physical protection methods and technology .  
The existence of effective national accountancy and control systems , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , and the existence of systems to ensure physical protection are crucial elements in fighting illicit trafficking . 
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
The tragic human suffering and the terrible material destruction brought about by more than 20 years of conflict also require that the international community following the round table on Angola being held in Brussels under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme continues to respond generously to the humanitarian aid needs and the challenge of reconstructing the country , particularly in the areas of demining and the social reintegration of the displaced and the demobilized . 
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
The report is lucid , concise and clear , and I take this opportunity to express OIC 's appreciation to the Secretary-General not only for the timely presentation of the useful material , but also for his continuing untiring efforts towards finding a just and honourable solution of the issue of Palestine .  
We should resolutely address the endogenous impediments to growth and development , which include political instability , ineffective and inefficient utilization of both human and material resources , inappropriate priority-setting , ill-conceived policy orientation and ill-designed and impractical implementation mechanisms . 
The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
This dual objective can not be achieved unless existing stockpiles of weapons-usable fissile material form an integral part of the negotiations , as reflected in the report of the Special Coordinator on this issue in the Conference on Disarmament and as indicated in the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee established within its framework .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
Developing local strategies for improving the quality of life and the environment , integrating decisions on land use and land management , investing in the public and private sectors and mobilizing human and material resources , thereby promoting employment generation that is environmentally sound and protective of human health .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
Moreover , as has been demonstrated in Nepal , while such benefits may be enjoyed within the country itself , many benefits from conservation are realized outside the country 's borders in forms as diverse as reduced flooding because of the protection of upland forests , the supply of medicinal plants and genetic material , or the pleasure given to international tourists .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
Indeed , despite the precarious situation and the difficulties inherent in moving from confrontation to cooperation on the path to national reconciliation , the steps taken by both parties and the stages that have already been passed have greatly helped to meet the conditions for the systematic implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , with a United Nations presence , whose human and material resources can measure up to its tasks . 
Nuclear establishments and the transport of nuclear material required appropriate physical protection , and States needed to have effective border controls so that they had control over what left their territory and were able to carry out their non-proliferation obligations not to permit sensitive nuclear materials to be transmitted to non-peaceful programmes or to terrorist groups .  
The main institution officially entrusted with the maintenance of public security is the National Police , which , according to a December 1994 study carried out by a Multinational Commission on Public Security , 2 / is seriously lacking in human and material resources , and is involved chiefly in administrative and protection functions in urban areas .  
In this context , it would be desirable to separate the police function from the military function and to have a police body with sufficient technical and operational training to carry out its activity in a spirit of respect for human rights , and for such a body to have greater human and material resources so that it can operate in rural areas and perform its irreplaceable functions . 
This blockade is being accompanied daily by heavy artillery shelling and murderous air-raids which have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians in southern Lebanon and in the western Bekaa and caused considerable material damage .  
All designated depository libraries are expected to place the material received in the care of qualified library staff , to keep it in good order and to make it accessible to the public , free of charge , at reasonable hours .  
Despite the success in providing compulsory primary education for girls and boys under adverse conditions , the quality of the education system and educational achievement are not satisfactory because of overcrowded schools , double shifts at the elementary level , lack of maintenance , inadequate teacher training , lack of educational material and low salaries . 
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
" Each State party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide : ( a ) source or special fissionable material , or ( b ) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use , or production of special fissionable material , to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes , unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this article ( IAEA safeguards ) . "  
For exports to a non-nuclear-weapon State not party to the Treaty , source or special fissionable material either directly transferred , or produced , processed , or used in the facility for which the transferred item is intended , shall not be diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Technical material . ( i ) Maintaining relevant databases and other information systems concerning hazardous waste generation , treatment technologies and regulatory and other instruments ; ( ii ) four updated PC-version of the database of the International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals and distribution of subsets thereof ; and ( iii ) establishment of one regional information network . ( a ) Advisory service .  
Parliamentary documentation .  ( i ) Four reports to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on the extent and developments in illicit traffic , with statistical and descriptive material , and analysis at the regional and global levels ; and ( ii ) contributions to the reports to regional meetings ( subsidiary bodies of the Commission ) on trends in illicit drug trafficking ;  
The estimated requirement of $ 393,500 , at maintenance base level , would cover the cost of general temporary assistance for the replacement of staff on maternity leave and sick leave and for additional services during peak workload periods ( $ 373,800 ) ; and overtime and night differential for the retention of clerical and distribution staff and radio and visual technicians beyond normal working hours in order to provide public information material to the media .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;  
At the same time , the practical activities of IAEA in implementing the safeguards should not hamper scientific and technical development or international cooperation by States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and should be based on optimum utilization of the Agency 's human and material resources .  
Article 1 ( c ) of the ECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents refers to the adverse consequences of industrial accidents on " ( i ) human beings , flora and fauna ; ( ii ) soil , water , air and landscape ; ( iii ) the interaction between the factors in ( i ) and ( ii ) ; material assets and cultural heritage , including historical monuments " .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
However , in view of the enormous material , personnel and logistical requirements necessary to ensure its proper functioning , I reiterate my appeal to Member States to make additional voluntary contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Fund established for the Tribunal .  
Among the points of discussion were the recruitment of students to central or local mine-clearance training schools ; the need for expatriate staff or technical advisers to stay on after the initial establishment of a national demining programme ; a recommendation that the United Nations provide pre-tailored material for new demining operations , including standard operating procedures , training and materials .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
FAO reported that , in support of its technical advisory assistance to member countries in the field of water law and its administration , it had issued in 1994 a publication entitled " Preparing national regulations for water resources management : principles and practice " ( FAO Legislative Study Series , No . 52 ) , which consisted of a manual providing conceptual material for use in the preparation of national regulations for the management , development , use and protection of freshwater resources . 
While welcoming the meeting held in Tombouctou on 16 and 17 July 1995 between the Government of Mali and northern Mali 's development partners , the Ministers renewed their appeal to the entire international community to increase its material and financial support for the implementation of all the provisions of the National Pact and for the consolidation of the peace process under way in the country .  
This has facilitated the monitoring of borders , coastlines , territorial and international waters , space and natural resources by means of powerful , ultra-precise radar networks , instead of by land , sea and air patrols , thereby freeing up human , material and temporal resources so as to secure borders against enemy infiltration and guaranteeing the repulsion of any violation of the integrity , security and stability of States or entire regions .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
Considering that the ultimate purpose of the State is none other than to create more equitable societies in which all members can realize their full human potential in terms of the material satisfaction of their basic needs and their intellectual and spiritual development in conditions of freedom , dignity , equality of opportunity and full respect for fundamental human rights ,  
We believe that the formulation of this concept , including aspects of financial , material and technical support by the international community for the peace process in Liberia , requires a realistic , weighted approach based on the provisions of previous Security Council resolutions .  
Thus , the Special Rapporteur now defines visual pornography as " the visual depiction of a child engaged in explicit sexual activity , real or simulated , or the lewd exhibition of genitals intended for the sexual gratification of the user , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material " .  
The Ministers expressed their support for the completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty no later than 1996 as well as the early conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminating and universally applicable convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Its objectives are : training of the key stakeholders in understanding the requirements and setting up the processes for the implementation of the Convention at the national level , and provision of substantive training material covering the Convention and providing the framework for wide-reaching in-country training by a country team set up and trained through the programme .  
Throughout 1995 , field officers have continued to travel from commune to commune meeting with civil , judicial and military authorities and local populations to learn about the general conditions of each commune , including security , access to property , the material needs and the functioning of the judiciary , conditions of detention centres and alleged human rights violations .  
They noted that this dangerous situation has led to tremendous losses in human lives , considerable material damage and unspeakable suffering among the population , including the massive movement of refugees .  
It presented the eradication of poverty as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative ( Declaration , Commitment 2 ) and stressed that societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families , and the communities in which they live ( ibid . , para .  NULL  
The High Commissioner also sought support for establishing national committees for human rights education , as focal points for Decade activities ; he asked that achievable goals be set and that the intellectual and material resources necessary to reach them be provided .  
In his country , whose population reflected an ethnic mixture created by successive waves of migrants , his Government had systematically extended moral , political and material support to all peoples struggling against racial discrimination and apartheid .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
Preschool institutions , homes for children deprived of parental care , disabled children and youth institutions for juvenile delinquents , are also in an increasingly difficult material situation , manifested by a poor quality of food and a considerable decline of standards , including poor hygienic standards , insufficient heating , inadequate maintenance , the impossibility to keep facilities and equipment in proper repair .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
The implementation of this crash programme , if successful , would have reduced the time required to attain sufficient nuclear material for a single nuclear weapon by up to two years compared to the probable production time-scale of Iraq 's EMIS and centrifuge enrichment programmes .  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
reorganization is reflected in the budgetary proposals for 1996 and concerns the expansion of the Strategy Team in the Investigation Section , a complete reorganization of the former Special Advisory Section into a new Legal Services Section and the provision of additional resources to the Information and Records Section to enable the efficient and timely processing of the huge amount of information , evidence and other material received by the Office so that it is accessible to the investigative and prosecutorial staff in the Office .

Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
situation was critical in certain border provinces , which , overburdened by the provision of enormous financial , material and human resources in the fight against such criminal activities , should receive the support of the international community .  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
Among the objectives of the audit are the necessary refocusing of the administration on its essential tasks ; the organization and establishment of well-adapted structures and flexible procedures to carry out these tasks ; and the establishment of adequate resources , both material and human , for the effective and efficient functioning of the administration .  
The Committee noted that recent spin-offs of space technology included a light-weight metal cutter for emergency rescue operations , an automotive assembly fastener , a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide , a portable ultraviolet indicator , a new greenhouse for agricultural crops , new foods and medicines and honeycomb fireproof insulation material .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The desire of a number of countries , including the Russian Federation ( which as a result of the imposition of sanctions has suffered and continues to suffer very substantial material and financial losses ) to elaborate practical ways and means to prevent the negative consequences of sanctions or , at least , to keep them to a minimum , are therefore fully justified .  
On this occasion , I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Governments of various countries , the affiliated organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , non-governmental organizations , and individuals for their moral , material and humanitarian assistance and encouragement to our people , which have been provided in the hope of removing , as quickly as possible , the damage caused in recent years by successive natural disasters .  
Furthermore , these leaders unanimously called for in-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first century with a restructured , reinvigorated Organization , equipped with the necessary human , material and financial resources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission of an Organization that harmonizes the complementary efforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in a context of freedom and active solidarity . 
There is no doubt that this singular situation , in which the creator of the rule of law is also its direct object , is less favourable to the development of a legal system which is balanced , whether as regards its normative scope or the material content of its rules .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
While there is no substitute for efficient national systems for accounting and control , especially in those countries possessing sensitive nuclear material , in preventing illicit trafficking , we recognize the crucial role the Agency can play in information-sharing and in identifying the sources of stolen material .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
In spite of the fact that resort to unilateral measures of economic compulsion not sanctioned by the world community for the purpose of gaining political dividends has been repeatedly deplored in the highest international forums , including those held under United Nations auspices , we note with regret that this practice remains in the political arsenals of some States , which use it to interfere in the internal affairs of other States and , in certain situations , for so-called material support of direct territorial claims .  
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
The Assembly will note that the draft convention deals with illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances and money laundering ; traffic in persons ; counterfeiting currency ; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects ; stealing and smuggling nuclear material , and the misuse or threat of misuse of such material to harm the public ; terrorist acts ; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms and explosive materials or devices ; illicit traffic in or stealing of motor vehicles ; and corruption of public officials .  
The true dimensions of this problem can clearly be seen when it is set against the background of the technical and material restrictions on demining that prevent any easy or rapid implementation and when we consider the risks and costs that make it prohibitive to individual countries .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Ukraine afforded women equal rights and opportunities in the areas of education and specialized training , labour , remuneration , promotion and socio-political and cultural activities and also implemented special measures to protect the labour and health of women , enable women to combine work with motherhood , and extend legal protection and material and moral support to mothers and children .  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
A wide variety of product and material taxes have been employed in OECD and developing countries to encourage more efficient use ( e.g . , pesticide taxes in Indonesia , fertilizer taxes in Scandinavia ) , to discourage / phase out certain substances ( e.g . , taxes on PVC and CFCs ) or to discourage the use of disposable products ( e.g . , plastic and paper tableware in Denmark , throwaway razors in the Netherlands ) .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
There is also a need to provide a selected number of centres with portable recording and radio feed equipment that can help them relay radio news to local broadcasters as well as transmit to Headquarters material gathered in their respective regions .  Recommendation 5 , Diversifying DPI audiovisual materials .  
The possibility that public awareness , educational or other material designed to prevent or reduce illicit demand may draw attention to the availability and means of abuse of prohibited drugs within certain segments of the population is a difficult issue that remains to be resolved .  
In the face of these serious challenges to the peace process , we call upon the Security Council to take effective and practical measures that would ensure the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people ; the cessation of the policy of aggression , settlement and Judaization of Jerusalem ; the preservation of its cultural , religious and material heritage , and demographic composition ; and the lifting of the siege against the Palestinian villages and cities .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
" Insulation " : applied to the components of a rocket motor , i.e . , the case , nozzle , inlets , case closures ; includes cured or semi-cured compounded rubber sheet stock containing an insulating or refractory material .  
" Micro-organisms " : bacteria , viruses , mycoplasmas , rickettsiae or fungi , whether natural , enhanced or modified , either in the form of " isolated live cultures " , including in dormant form or in dried preparations , or as material , including living material , which has been deliberately inoculated or contaminated with such cultures .  
Potential carbon dioxide utilization , disposal , and storage options include enhanced oil recovery , storage in depleted natural gas fields and other underground reservoirs , chemical feedstocks and other basic material , and finally disposal in the deep ocean .  
Table 2 shows that 32,483 work-months , that is 62 per cent of the total work-months utilized , were committed for the implementation of activities that generate final outputs under the major categories of parliamentary services , published material and information services . 
We pledge our support for efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) designated as not intended for use for meeting defence requirements is safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant voluntary offer IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so .  
Accordingly , we have concluded that increased cooperation among our Governments to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material will contribute to increased international security and public safety , and to achievement of global non-proliferation objectives .  
Support efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material ( separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium ) not intended for use in meeting defence requirements is safely and effectively stored and protected and placed under IAEA safeguards ( in the nuclear-weapon States , under the relevant " voluntary offer " IAEA safeguards agreements ) as soon as it is practicable to do so ;  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Giving a high priority to eradicating the most extreme forms of poverty by trying to reach the poorest of the poor raises not only practical questions of how it can be done in practice with limited resources , material and administrative but also difficult questions of social justice . 
We are referring to the desire of the peoples and States of the Commonwealth to make more effective use of their material and intellectual potential with a view to stimulating their economies , raising their standard of living and ensuring sustainable democratic development .  
In this connection , the Council pledges its continued political and material support for the efforts of the United Nations Special Commission entrusted with the elimination of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and invites the international community to participate actively in supporting the Commission 's efforts in every way possible in order to enable it to achieve its objective of placing the security and stability of the region on a firm foundation .  
In its resolution 46 / 182 of 19 December 1991 , the General Assembly stated its deep concern about the suffering of the victims of disasters and emergency situations , the loss in human lives , the flow of refugees , the mass displacement of people and the material destruction , and set forth a number of guiding principles and measures to strengthen the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system .  
The secretariat for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction has continued to support and coordinate the implementation of the Decade 's targets and its overall objective of reducing , through concerted international action , the loss of life , material destruction , and social and economic disruption which occur as a consequence of natural disasters .  
These incursive and cruel activities which resulted in numerous human casualties and material damages to civilian population constitute a grave violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran .  
The problem is that normally people living in areas with high potential biodiversity values are poorer and have less or no paying capacity compared with people in industrialized countries , where the value of biodiversity is often recognized , for example , as raw material for the pharmaceutical industry , or in terms of recreation for visitors . 
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
The energy sector ( petroleum and electricity ) has suffered considerable material losses as a result of the mandatory sanctions applied pursuant to Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) , and negative repercussions have been felt in most of the vital facilities and economic entities of that sector .  
The need to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and to adopt appropriate and effective measures to ensure the prevention , detection and punishment of offences relating to nuclear material , which are a matter of grave concern to the international community , led the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to adopt the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 13 / at Vienna on 26 October 1979 .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
However , zero nuclear weapons might not be a stable , reassuring zero unless all fissile material , and the dedicated nuclear infrastructure , has been placed under satisfactory international control .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
For the international regime for the storage and control of plutonium , the question for the near future is hardly whether or not to establish a full-fledged regime , but whether to prepare a legal framework and an option for countries to deposit fissile material when they deem that desirable , hence proceeding in a gradual , pragmatic fashion .  
The Special Rapporteur has maintained and continues to maintain that mercenaries exist ; that they are not a small number of individuals ; that they are groups of professionals selling their skill in war and violence ; that they are also criminal organizations , an international blight in their perpetration of acts of violence which ruin human lives , create material losses , hamper economic activity and extend to terrorist attacks that have touched off or aggravated conflicts , with often catastrophic results for the peoples affected by them . 
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of arts ,  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
" The inhuman Israeli practices include the various material , political , cultural and social situations of the Arab citizens in the occupied region of the Syrian Arab Golan , not to mention the continuity of settlement policy , advancing to the Arab territories , destruction of building , theft of antiquities , investment and seizure of lands , natural resources and water sources . "  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In August 1993 , it approved a proposal presented by SAMCOMM , following a meeting of riparian States in Bucharest , that vessels , both powered or non-powered , which carried no goods or commodities , excluding packing material intended for reuse ( empty reels , pallets , etc . ) , could transit without specific prior authorization of the Committee , provided that all movements were notified to the SAMs teams by shipping operators and that the vessels were subject to monitoring before entry to and exit from the Danube portion between Vidin / Calafat and Mohacs .  
In Poland 's view , the proposed new framework convention should be based on existing international instruments regulating illicit narcotic drug trafficking , trafficking in persons , the protection of nuclear material and the import and export of cultural property as well as bilateral and regional agreements on crime prevention .  
Please provide information on the measures adopted to ensure that children have access from a diversity of national and international sources to information and material aimed at the promotion of the child 's social , spiritual and moral well _ being and physical and mental health .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
Makes an impassioned appeal to the United Nations system and to intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to join in providing assistance to those segments of the population most gravely affected by the embargo and whose already grim economic , material and health conditions are being greatly exacerbated by the total blockade imposed against Burundi , namely , displaced persons , returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
They combine reckless exploitation of living resources in these zones with the dumping of hazardous material and other equally repugnant activities contrary to international law and civilized conduct .  
Provision of legal , social , financial and material assistance to victims of trafficking ( physical and psychological rehabilitation , professional retraining , provision of shelter , lawyers , hot-line services , medical aid , assistance in contacts with the police , embassies , etc . ) as well as to their families ;

The material means of progress can be acquired , but human resources - skilled , spirited and inventive workers - are indispensable , as is the enrichment found through mutual dialogue and the free interchange of ideas .  
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
During the period under review , the Council 's informal working group on documentation and other procedural questions worked hard to find ways of satisfying the wish of Member States to receive in a timely manner a substantive , analytical and material account of the Council 's work .  
We , who have a closed fuel cycle nuclear power programme , have consistently opposed the inclusion of spent fuel , which is a valuable resource material , along with radioactive waste in this convention .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
As a result of the firm resolve of the leaders of ECOWAS and the determination of ECOMOG , coupled with the enhanced material and logistic support received from friendly countries within and outside the subregion , the disarmament of the warring factions was successfully accomplished as scheduled , on 31 January 1997 .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
We would like first and foremost to express our gratitude to those States and international organizations that have continued to provide financial and material support to Djibouti , particularly those that participated in and made pledges during the round table on Djibouti held at Geneva in May 1997 .  
It is inequitable to reprobate and qualify as warlords those who are fighting for the independence of Afghanistan and not for personal and material gain and to equate them with those who are serving the interests of a foreign country by inviting foreign military personnel .  
All of these factors combined make it vitally important that the international community mobilize its efforts to achieve a rapid settlement while continuing to provide needed humanitarian and material assistance in other words , we need a comprehensive strategy for rehabilitation to go with the current ongoing efforts to settle the problem of Afghanistan .  
We therefore appeal from this rostrum for merging our efforts at the Government and organizational level , both inter-State and voluntary , to galvanize our will and generate our energies , both official and at the mass level , in order to provide material and technical resources to implement practical and well-considered programmes to achieve this end .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 1 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably " with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out " .  
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
Expressing its grave concern at the enormous human suffering and material damage sustained by the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples as a result of the maintenance of the coercive measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriya under Security Council resolutions 748 ( 1992 ) and 883 ( 1993 ) ,  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
The difficulties experienced in the search for mines and remnants of war on Libyan territory due to the lack of maps and precise data on location , number and type , in addition to the fact that they are scattered at random over an extensive area , make it hard to give a comprehensive and precise report on the human and material losses caused by landmines and remnants of war in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . 
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The limited human , technical and material national resources have been concentrated on sweeping areas where mines and remnants of war are known to be present , and where their location has been established by citizens ' reports on the accidents they have caused or by companies carrying out development projects .  
One commentary on the 1988 Convention ; two publications on laws and regulations to give effect to international drug control treaties ; two directories of competent national authorities under the international drug control treaties ; two directories on manufacturers of narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and their precursors under international control ; and a cumulative index : national laws and regulations promulgated to give effect to international drug control treaties ; ( iii ) Technical material . 
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
Acknowledging that biological resources could also be region-specific or shared by more than one member country , and acknowledging also the difficulties in securing fully effective enforcement of regulations of transfer , particularly because very small quantities of genetic material are sufficient for research and development purposes and that there is the possibility that these can cross borders undetected ,  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
One of the key provisions in this context is article 17 , under which States parties recognize the important function performed by the mass media and shall ensure that the child has access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources , especially those aimed at the promotion of his or her social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
Given the relative stabilization of the volume of parliamentary documentation received for translation and the steady use of contractual translation in this operation ( roughly 15 per cent of the material processed ) , it can be said that established staff resources at their current level , supplemented as necessary by temporary assistance during peak workload periods , are appropriate to ensure proper translation of all documentation in the six official languages .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the entire international community for their immense political , diplomatic and material support to Sierra Leone , and to my Government and people in these difficult times .  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities " .  
What is needed , with regard to the effective promotion and protection of those rights , is for the Organization and its Member States to take more decisive steps towards the inalienable right to development , understood not only as economic growth but also as eradication of poverty and the satisfaction of the basic material and spiritual needs of the human being in conditions of equal opportunity .  
First , it should be noted that some replies do not correspond to the request for information made by the Secretary _ General , but they have nevertheless been included because they provided material for discussion on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights with regard to social measures at the national level , the right to self-determination and the right of countries to sovereignty over their natural resources .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add " and public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities . "  
The reports are lucid , concise and clear , and I take this opportunity to express the OIC 's appreciation to , the Secretary-General not only for the timely presentation of this useful material but also for the continuing , untiring efforts towards finding an honourable solution to the Afghanistan question in cooperation with the OIC . 
The events of 28 September 1995 , during which an army of international mercenaries invaded my country , overthrew the President of the Republic , disrupted constitutional order and , consequently , State institutions , further worsened our economic crisis and led to substantial material losses and structural damage .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his annual report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session , 11 preventive measures are highly cost-effective , as the sums they require are paltry by comparison with the huge costs in human suffering and material damage which war always brings , and they also compare favourably ' with the less huge , but nevertheless substantial , cost of deploying a peacekeeping operation after hostilities have broken out ' .  
We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
Not only are large numbers of children killed and injured , but countless others grow up deprived of their material and emotional needs , including the structures that give meaning to social and cultural life .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the social situation at the global level as the reason for convening the Summit , the Declaration reckoned that there existed an urgent need to address profound social problems , especially poverty , unemployment and social exclusion , and that our societies must respond more effectively to the material and spiritual needs of individuals , their families and their communities .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
Similarly , it continues to be deeply concerned by the fact that to date the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea has not provided the Agency with the information it needs to verify that it has not diverted nuclear material to illicit uses and that its initial declaration is correct and complete .  
For that reason , we reiterate our grave concern at the increasingly frequent transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste through areas of the high seas close to our exclusive economic zone .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
The United Nations Department for Public Information ( DPI ) highlighted the important role of public information in raising awareness of the question of human rights and mass exodus , highlighting activities such as the production of print material , films , radio and television programmes and radio documentaries , as well as collaborating with NGOs and coordinating inter-agency promotional activities .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Adopting all necessary legislative , administrative and technical measures to ensure the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations and nuclear devices as well as protection against illegal or unauthorized access to them by third parties .  
Upon the completion of the proceedings connected with an act of nuclear terrorism , if it is considered feasible , any nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste or any other radioactive substances as well as nuclear installations , nuclear explosive or radiation-dissemination devices , including homemade devices and / or their components or objects of which they are components shall be returned to the State party , to which they belong or which was the State of their origin .  
States parties shall not be required by this Convention to provide any information which they are not permitted to communicate pursuant to domestic legislation or which would jeopardize the security of the State concerned or the physical protection of nuclear material , nuclear fuel , radioactive products or waste , radioactive substances , nuclear installations , nuclear devices or their components or objects of which they are components .  
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Teachers are duty-bound to nurture their pupils to have a strong moral base , free from thinking highly of counter _ cultures and material development of other countries . . . prevent them from becoming ones who will seek their own gain and betray the national cause .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Those documents contain many factual clarifications and rebuttals of the allegations and fabrications , totally unsubstantiated by any material proof , which the Special Rapporteur included in his previous reports and which he is still reiterating for political reasons the main aim of which is to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national leadership .  
Regarding paragraphs 16 _ 21 , concerning what he calls guilt by association , the Government of Iraq wishes to emphasize that the allegations contained in these paragraphs are totally unfounded ; they are pure fabrications and biased accusations that are baseless , devoid of any material proof and intended to besmirch the reputation of Iraq and its national regime . 
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Concerned with the growing threat of organized crime , including the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , money-laundering , illicit traffic in arms , nuclear material and explosive devices , motor vehicles , objects of art ,  
This size range covers the building blocks of pristine interplanetary and cometary particles , i.e . the silicate core particles ( 100-200 nanometres ) , refractory organic mantle ( about 10 nanometres ) and possible crystalline structure of the material .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
It may be inferred from the current case law of the international legal bodies that the basis for determining the amount and nature of the compensation is not solely the physical or material injury or damage but also the direct or indirect moral injury .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
I urge each of you to consider the reinforcing impact that an FMCT would have on parallel efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads , to place fissile material that is determined to be excess to national security requirements under safeguards , and to achieve even deeper nuclear weapons reductions leading toward their eventual elimination .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
Financial , material and technical assistance complemented by a favourable international economic environment was imperative for the realization of the strategic objectives set out in Beijing .  
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
Information centres are an essential partner in this effort , whether establishing strong working relationships with the local media and responding to their inquiries ; cooperating with civil society and other local partners to promote major United Nations themes ; disseminating the Department 's products , such as booklets , brochures or United Nations radio and video programmes ; maintaining reference libraries ; translating the Department 's material into local languages ; servicing visits of the Secretary-General and other senior officials to their host countries ; or maintaining liaison with Governments .  
The international collaborative exercises constitute the first phase of the international quality assurance programme , carried out by UNDCP , in which participating laboratories are requested , twice a year , to analyse unknown samples of seized material and / or biological specimens .  
Human resources development will be achieved by organization of training courses , at basic and advanced levels , in methods for the identification and analysis of controlled drugs in seized material , pharmaceutical preparations , body fluids and precursors ; development and distribution of training syllabuses , teaching aids and scientific literature to regional training centres and collaborating institutions ; and organization of regional workshops of heads of national drug-testing laboratories .  
Changes in the sectoral composition of world output towards less commodity-intensive service sectors , combined with technological advances making for less raw material use per unit of output , appear to foreshadow a continuing long-run decline in the prices of primary commodities relative to those of manufactured goods .  
This included sexually explicit , abusive , seditious , terrorist or hate material or communication of false , misleading or fraudulent material .  
While understanding the difficult economic situation and the difficulty of reaching durable solutions to the refugee problem , the Committee expressed its concern with respect to the precarious material and psychological conditions of women refugees .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
At the national level , numerous charitable organizations and benevolent societies provided medical and material assistance to the poor and needy .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
This assistance is extremely important and urgent now , as unprecedented heavy rains and destructive landslides have killed dozens of people , left hundreds homeless and done enormous material damage to the national economy and to the social infrastructure .  
But it is self-evident that our national and international commitment , as well as limited human financial and material resources , mandates bilateral and regional cooperation in battling the better-equipped narco-traffickers .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
A fundamental prerequisite for transparency would be the application of consistent and strict standards of accounting and secure handling and storage procedures for fissile material at the national level .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
In that case , Iraq had refused to accede to a request by a chief inspector to be furnished with a copy of a document highly pertinent to obtaining a verifiable material balance of Iraq 's munitions filled with chemical or biological agents .  
Confidential material so classified by the coastal State shall remain confidential after consideration of the submission is concluded unless decided otherwise by the Commission with the written consent of the coastal State concerned .  
The El Nino phenomenon has a recurring character , often with severe impacts on regional weather patterns , which in their turn can result in large material , economic , human and environmental losses .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The activities concerned included training for judicial , administrative and military authorities , provision of material and logistical support to judicial authorities , as well as awareness campaigns , selection and training of government officials within ministries to act as human rights focal points , capacity-building for non _ governmental organizations , and training initiatives with a focus on social and economic rights .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
These could include making appropriate amendments to existing forms of intellectual property rights ; implementing new administrative procedures ( for example , with regard to the patent application process ) ; and using alternative standard forms of legal protection rather than by legislation ( for example , material transfer agreements , biodiversity contracts and licencing agreements ) .  
Out of a total quantity of fissile material of weapons _ grade quality , which is estimated at roughly 2,000 tons , almost 1,400 tons constitute so _ called transitional material , in other words , declared or undeclared excess material .  
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
They expressed their grave concern at the renewed outbreak of hostilities in the Congo following the perpetration of acts of destabilization by armed groups , causing huge losses of life and material damage and hindering the implementation of commitments undertaken by the authorities to take measures to promote national reconciliation , rebuild the country and relaunch the democratic process .  
It was a timely initiative , particularly in the light of the growing threat of the use of nuclear or radioactive material by irresponsible individuals or groups .  
Hungary attached great importance to the adoption of the convention , since it would provide an excellent basis for proactive international cooperation , and hoped that it would serve as a deterrent and that some of its provisions would not have to be invoked , especially article 2 , paragraph 1 ( b ) concerning the actual use of radioactive material by terrorists . 
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
The definition of visual child pornography was to read as follows : Child pornography is the visual depiction of a child , real or simulated , engaged in explicit sexual activity , or the lewd exhibition of genitals , and involves the production , distribution and / or use of such material .  
The cantons were required to provide victims with access to independent public or private counselling centres whose task it was to offer medical , psychological , social , material and legal support and to give information on victim assistance .  
Pamphlets , brochures and wall charts on the impact of global conferences on quality of life ; development of technical notes , indicators , guidelines , and other material on selected themes , including good practices and success stories , relevant to integrated regional follow-up by the Arab States to United Nations global conferences ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Although complex politico-military developments in Angola during the period under review have placed additional strain on the material and human assets of the Observer Mission , resources provided by the General Assembly for this period proved to be adequate to meet MONUAs operational requirements .  
The Law on Social Care and Provision of Social Security of Serbia defines the family in the following manner : for the purposes of exercising the right to material support the family is understood to mean the spouses or two people of different sexes , children ( born in and out of wedlock , adopted or foster ) and kinsmen in the direct line and in the lateral line up to the second degree of kinship , provided they live in a common household .  
By enlisting enormous military might and by aerial bombardment of the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , its infrastructure and economic potentials , NATO has brazenly dropped more than 5,000 tons of the most destructive explosives and used cluster bombs banned by international law , causing enormous human casualties and vast material destruction .  
Since , in the situation of the incessant aggression of NATO and round-the-clock aerial bombardment , it is not possible at this moment to ascertain the exact scope of material and other damage and the number of people who lost their lives and were buried under the debris up until 18 April 1999 , only the damage and consequences eyewitnessed by the public , including numerous world media which reported them , are provided in the aide-mmoire .  
At the end of his testimony , each man requested that compensation be paid for the consequent material damage and mental suffering , as did all those others who attended the sessions of the Chamber in order to pursue civil claims .  
On the basis of the reports prepared by the technical experts and attached to the documentation , which set forth the material damage sustained by public and private installations in the two aforementioned cities ;  
In other words , a Government or a State should possess on a permanent basis , a legal system and material resources sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of [ its ] international obligations under normal conditions . 30 In particular , the State must have established , and maintain , an administrative apparatus that is minimally sufficient to permit it to fulfil those obligations ; 
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Thus , the international community , especially the United Nations , must step up its activities to end the humanitarian suffering of the victims of the situation and of those States that have sheltered a large number of refugees and displaced persons , thereby assuming a significant additional material and logistical burden .  
insufficient supervision by the Public Prosecutor of the legality of and justification for prosecuting individuals , and detaining or arresting them or depriving them of their freedom leads to a situation in which the courts examine individual cases involving persons whose guilt has not been proven by material evidence , and the investigation of which is at times conducted in a superficial manner and without a detailed and critical analysis of the facts of the case .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
To re-establish , under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon states should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of source or special fissionable material or equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon States should require , as a necessary precondition , acceptance of the Agency 's full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapons States should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Reaffirmation that new supply arrangements for the transfer of sources or special fissionable material or equipment or material specially designed or prepared for the processing , use or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon States should require as a necessary precondition , acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear explosive device .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The CANZ delegations would have expected any questions surrounding such material amounts to have been settled and appropriate adjustments made to the financial statements before the accounts were submitted to Member States : the problem of unliquidated obligations was not new , had been the subject of critical comment by the Board of Auditors and the Advisory Committee in the past and had a direct impact on the funds due to Member States whether as troop contributors or as recipients of credits .  
The first type is in terms of the gross output , based on its status and whether it is a final ( parliamentary services , published material , information materials and services , advisory services , training courses / seminars / workshops ) or an intermediate ( coordination , harmonization and liaison or international cooperation ) output .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
Grosso modo , the newcomers and their successors imbued ( and imbue ) the land with an essentially patrimonial value , making it subject to exclusive individual appropriation ( and , thus , capable of being passed on to others at the will of the title holder ) , a source of material wealth and a basis for political and economic power .  
Owing to their special relationship , spiritual and material , with their lands , the Special Rapporteur believes that very little or no progress can be made in this regard without tackling , solving and redressing - in a way acceptable to the indigenous peoples concerned - the question of their uninterrupted dispossession of this unique resource , vital to their lives and survival .  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
The fundamental challenge facing this system is to provide targeted economic support for families facing material difficulties , to provide social assistance to single elderly people , particularly women , and to provide social and occupational rehabilitation for disabled people .  
Quality of life is determined not simply by material goods , but is made up of a whole set of simultaneously interwoven factors : health , education , employment , elimination of poverty , respect of human rights , the possibility of self-fulfilment , social and cultural integration and living in an ecologically enlightened environment .  
The programme , which does away with any mutilation , encourages girls ready to assume their adult responsibilities to seclude themselves for a week during which they receive parts of the traditional education on their future roles as women plus more modern material on health , reproductive problems , effective means of communication , self _ respect and esteem and how to deal with problems they may encounter in their lives as women . 
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
Viewed from this perspective the FMT could capture in an irreversible way weapons material declared as excess in an ongoing process ; prevent altogether or regulate the further production of weapons _ grade materials for legitimate uses such as fuel for research reactors , naval reactors , etc . ; make closed _ down production and associated facilities subject to verification to prevent their reuse for weapons purposes .  
While recognizing the efforts made by the State party in the area of education , the Committee remains concerned at the high drop _ out rate for males in the upper grades of primary school , the poor reading ability or primary school males , the high incidence of truancy , lack of relevant learning material , insufficient numbers of trained and qualified teachers , and the tendency towards teaching methods that are almost exclusively exam oriented .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
Sectors that have been the main targets for recent anti-dumping actions are metals and metal products , chemical products , machinery and electrical equipment , plastics and plastic products , textiles and clothing , pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material , prepared foodstuffs and beverages , stone and plaster products , other manufactured products , footwear and headgear .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
OCHA is mandated to mobilize and coordinate the collective efforts of the international community , in particular those of the United Nations system , to meet in a coherent and timely manner the needs of those exposed to human suffering and material destruction in disasters and emergencies .  
In the opinion of Poland , costs borne by the international community in connection with the imposition of sanctions are usually significantly lower in material as well as in human dimensions than potential costs of military or peacekeeping operations that could be needed in cases when sanctions are not imposed or the sanctions regime is not fully observed .  
Second , exploring innovative and practical measures of assistance to third States should also include the provision of a special or preferential treatment for the suppliers from affected non-target States in allocating them appropriate quotas for legitimate humanitarian supplies to the target countries , material supplies for the United Nations peacekeeping operations and participation in international efforts for post-conflict rehabilitation , reconstruction and development .  
Nigeria and indeed the entire West African subregion have devoted considerable human , material , political and diplomatic resources to the resolution of these crises in the subregion , starting with Liberia and subsequently Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Recalls the decision by the Conference on Disarmament2 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator3 and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
For this purpose new course materials were developed ( on the analysis of the effects of international trade policies , using a global model ) , existing material was adapted to distance learning techniques and a new project intended for Portuguese-speaking countries is currently being developed in Brazil and Cape Verde and will be extended to other lusophone countries , with the expertise of consultants specialized in human resources development in those countries .  
Furthermore , bearing in mind both the emphasis placed in Council resolution 1996 / 31 on encouraging geographical diversity among NGOs and the large number of organizations with limited access to technology , the Section has devoted considerable effort to the production of informative written material and training workshops .  
The United Nations must provide some direction in the debate on the complex issues surrounding royalties for genetic material , and should help to fashion an international technological architecture that encouraged technological advances , but not at the cost of marginalizing the poorest and most vulnerable .  
His Governments long-term sustainable development strategies were aimed at upgrading the living standard of the citizens of Fiji , eradicating poverty , empowering women and youth , increasing employment and protecting the environment , in particular from land degradation and the trans-shipment of hazardous and toxic material across the oceans .  
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
All the international organizations operating in the field of health are also providing technical and material assistance to improve the quality of the health services available to the population , particularly at the primary health-care level , now that these services have become widely accessible to the whole population .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
To establish a single economic space in order to ensure socio-economic development on the basis of the united material and intellectual potential of the participating States and the use of market mechanisms for the functioning of the economy ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
In accordance with the rules governing international responsibility , we affirm the legally established right of the Republic of Iraq to seek compensation for all the losses , in terms of human , material and moral damage , that have been sustained by Iraq and its people owing to acts of aggression that are contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
The legal records of the trials in Cuba of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan nationals charged with being the material perpetrators of the offences give precise details of the premises , places , houses , hotels , restaurants , districts , towns , etc . , where the offences were planned and prepared and where the mercenaries were recruited , hired , trained and funded .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
At the end of former paragraph 15.28 ( b ) ( iii ) , add , including public relations material to promote the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the combat against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
All this has had a positive effect on the quality of life in Libyan society , as has the provision of all basic social services , despite the coercive economic sanctions that have been imposed on the people of Libya in 1990 s , caused serious human and material damage and hampered programmes and plans devoted to social development .  
These include effective export control , adequate physical protection of nuclear material and facilities , accelerated steps towards nuclear disarmament and an appropriate arrangement for global and regional security .  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The Agencys efforts in improving physical protection guidelines and assisting States in implementing effective physical protection systems at the national and facility levels serve as major steps towards better control of illicit trafficking in nuclear material .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
The plundering of the cultural heritage of Cyprus in this area has been so widespread that it led to a decision by the United States , a decision which we warmly welcome , to impose an emergency import restriction in April of this year on Byzantine ecclesiastical and ritual ethnological material from Cyprus , unless such material is accompanied by an export permit issued by the Government of Cyprus .  
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
Recognizing further that the use of nuclear power sources in outer space should be based on a thorough safety assessment , including probabilistic risk analysis , with particular emphasis on reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the public to harmful radiation or radioactive material ,  
For the purposes of paragraph 2 ( d ) of principle 3 , the term made critical does not include actions such as zero-power testing which are fundamental to ensuring system safety.In order to minimize the quantity of radioactive material in space and the risks involved , the use of nuclear power sources in outer space shall be restricted to those space missions which can not be operated by non-nuclear energy sources in a reasonable way .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
In its report the Team presented the preliminary conclusion that the systematic massacre of those Rwandan Hutus ] remaining in Zaire was an abhorrent crime against humanity , but the underlying rationale for the decisions is material to whether these killings constituted genocide , that is to eliminate , in part , the Hutu ethnic group .  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
If current trends in energy and fossil fuel consumption continue , by 2010 global energy consumption and CO2 emissions will have risen by almost 50 per cent above 1993 levels . 11 There is general agreement that further increases in energy and material efficiency in production processes will need to be combined with shifts in consumption patterns towards goods and services that are inherently less energy and resource intensive if greenhouse gas emissions are to be stabilized . 
Many mercenaries who are experts in the use of explosives and technical devices with destructive material effects are hired to commit deadly attacks that cause collective fear and dread or , in other words , indiscriminate terror .  
In a noteworthy educational project that takes a holistic approach in addressing the needs of the internally displaced and host populations alike , the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) is developing a nationwide human rights education programme which will provide training and course material on human rights standards to all schools .  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
It called for parallel negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a comprehensive agreement banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices pursuant to paragraph 4 of the decision on Principles and objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
One of the principal characteristics of such an international instrument must be its non _ discriminatory nature in the sense that a uniform regime for strict international verification should be applied to all States and to all facilities capable of producing fissile material in all States without exception .  
On the other hand , such a treaty must be internationally and effectively verifiable , which means that the international instrument to be negotiated should be based on absolute transparency , which implies that all facilities anywhere in the world that are involved in the process of the production or storage of fissile material must be subject to a strict regime of control and inspection .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
Enhance the rapid deployment capacity of the Logistics Base by providing the best service possible to newly established peacekeeping missions and also to strengthen the logistics support of existing peacekeeping missions by taking action in a timely fashion on material release orders as follows : immediate operational requirements in 24 hours , urgent requests in 7 days and routine requests in 15 to 21 days ;  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The religious denominations and non _ traditional religious groups in Azerbaijan engage in charitable activities , assist a wide variety of communities , provide humanitarian assistance and visit boarding schools , homes for the disabled , hospitals and places of detention , providing material and moral support .  
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
Strengthening programme management capacity , including logistical systems , to make services safer , more affordable and more convenient and accessible to clients and to ensure the availability and continuous supply of safe and effective contraceptives and other sexual and reproductive health supplies and , as appropriate , the raw material for them ;  
Although that countrys claim that the Sudan was supporting the northern resistance army continued to lack credible evidence , there was ample proof that the United States Government was providing material and financial assistance to the southern Sudanese rebel movement .  
Recognizes the need to direct concerted efforts at enhancing the technical skills and know-how of people living in rural and agricultural areas with a view to improving their means of livelihood and material well-being and , in this regard , encourages the allocation of more resources for this purpose so as to facilitate access to appropriate technology and know-how from within and from other countries , in particular the developed countries , as well as through South-South cooperation ;  
On the one hand , we have witnessed of amazing scientific , technological and material progress , the spread of human rights and democracy and the development of universal international institutions .  
We hope that we have all learned the lessons from events which have so seriously affected the country in human , material , psychological and other terms , and that we understand that war will always be a bad master and the worst choice .  
As a matter of definition of our priorities , we would prefer to devote greater political capital , as well as greater material resources , to conflict prevention and to supporting countries with unstable social , civil and economic structures .  
It may also be true that our continent is not yet free from this blight , which has drained some of our countries of resources , both material and human , which should have been used to improve the quality of life of the poor and the disadvantaged .  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
In those days of deep crisis , Pakistan extended moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country in defence of international law and morality as a sign of our solidarity with them in the hour of suffering .  
We believe that the international community and the countries of Africa first and foremost should help each other and provide financial , moral , material , intellectual and political resources to the Centre , whose work we consider beneficial .  
Equally important , the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of ongoing efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons and the need to ensure that excess fissile material is handled in a safe and effective way .  
This is a mass organization , whose main functions are to help take care of the material and spiritual life of older persons and to engage them in the political , social and cultural activities of the local community .  
By civilization , we mean an advanced level of intellectual , cultural and material development within a human society , featuring progress in the arts and sciences , the common use of writing and the emergence of complex political and social institutions .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification . 
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
That encouraging trend required adequate financial and material assistance as well as the political and moral support of the international community .  
During the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina , Pakistan extended unequivocal moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country , in defence of international law and morality and as proof of our solidarity with them .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
When data can be identified and controlled by a particular data carrier , such as data stored on a ( set of ) floppy disks they can , from a legal point of view , be considered one tangible material object .  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
Food , shelter or any other basic material need of the individual can be satisfied through coercive means , including rationing , and economies can be prosperous in terms of investment , production and growth in a totalitarian political context .  
Starting materials designated to be of pharmacopoeial quality should meet the respective requirements before the material can be labelled and accepted for the intended pharmaceutical use ;  
In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification .  
In the future , combating racial discrimination would be more difficult as it would be expressed less and less in crude forms of colour discrimination , but rather would be combined with class and other material conditions .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
His delegation looked forward to the resumption and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a binding universal legal instrument banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The Russian Federation was contributing to the technical development of safeguards through a national support programme aimed at improving analytical methods , modernizing the technical means employed , and producing and certifying samples of nuclear material .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Pakistan extended unequivocal moral , political , financial and material support to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in defence of international law and morality and as proof of our solidarity with them .  
The international community should make any assistance political , diplomatic , financial , material or military to parties to armed conflict contingent on their observing standards for the protection of children .  
Although scientific and technological progress is being made and material wealth is being accumulated , technological symposiums and other activities reaching broad sectors of the population are needed if the desired level of development is to be attained .  
A deliberate action calculated to step up ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Serbs and other nonAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija , it is a means of imposing neocolonialist control over the natural , material and human resources of a sovereign country .  
The distressing feature of the First and Second World Wars was that they made use of the advanced technologies of the late nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century to cause enormous human and material devastation .  
The Committee notes with concern that children living in the outer islands do not have adequate access to information and material from a diversity of national and international sources aimed at promoting the childs development and physical and mental health .  
Mr . Salman ( Iraq ) affirmed that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq constituted an example of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment and of violence against men , women and children who had sustained considerable material and physical suffering .  
Investment in conflict prevention should be seen as our premium for a secure future , a future insured against the costs of war financial , human and material a future assured of shared security instead of a shared burden .  
Likewise , the political support of the United Nations in this case , the Security Council and the provision of material and technical assistance by the international community are essential for the successful implementation of the ECOWAS initiative to deploy a multinational ECOWAS Monitoring Group force along the borders of Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .  
We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .  
We also called for an overhaul of this regime to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people by enabling Iraq to import all its basic humanitarian needs , medical supplies , foodstuffs and educational material , without requiring the prior consent of the Council .  
My delegation would like to join in the unanimous tribute to the French delegation for its work in presiding over the Council last month and to congratulate it for the outstanding way in which it handled the tragic events that plunged the United States of America and the world into mourning as a result of the horrendous attacks on New York , Washington D.C . and Pennsylvania , which caused incalculable human and material loss .  
Five years of neutrality have provided them with the opportunity for peaceful and constructive labour in conditions of internal harmony and stability , the laying of a stable material and spiritual foundation for accelerated economic reform , the gradual introduction of democratic standards and institutions , and the elevation of the country in the near future to the ranks of the worlds modern developed States .  
Concern has been expressed that , where the summary of a 1503 communication is edited to eliminate material that may not deal expressly with the rights of women , this may distort the overall gist of the communication and may make it difficult to evaluate a governmental response that addresses all issues raised in the original communication .  
His Government attached great importance to the material and spiritual lives of its people , and since 1986 , it had been encouraging the expansion of different economic sectors ; that policy had resulted in the growth of a national economy and had established the countrys legislative foundation as reflected in the 1991 adoption of its first Constitution and in other instruments .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Express our concern that beyond the material progress of racism is the disturbing fact that contemporary forms and manifestations of racism are striving to regain political , moral and even legal recognition in many ways , including through legislative prescriptions such as those relating to the freedom of expression , the platforms of some political parties and organizations , and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on racial superiority ;  
Also strongly reaffirm that as a pressing requirement of justice , victims of human rights violations as a result of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should be assured effective protection and remedies as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage as a result of violations in the implementation of human rights standards ;  
Consequently , the Council , in its resolution 724 ( XXVIII ) of 17 July 1959 , requested the Secretary-General to inform the IAEA of its desire that the IAEA be entrusted with the drafting of recommendations on the transport of radioactive material , on the understanding that these recommendations would be consistent with the principles adopted by the Committee and that they would be established in consultation with the United Nations and the specialized agencies concerned .  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
All the acts mentioned , in the context which concerns us , are formulated [ 62 ] through unilateral declarations , whether of individual or collective origin , and these declarations are subject to definite forms as far as their conditions of validity are concerned ; the rules apply to all of them regardless of their content or material classification .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
In addition to the continued unity of effort of its components , in close cooperation with KFOR , in the crucial period in the run-up to elections , the Mission will require the ongoing support of its activities by the international community , including material support , and , above all , the strong and committed support it has enjoyed from members of the Security Council and Member States since its inception .  
The simple fact that a particular category of the population suffers from underprivileged economic or social conditions does not mean that , in order to upgrade its material position , any distinction based on a characteristic defining the group should be considered legitimate , even if the ground is irrelevant as a basis of distinction with regard to a particular right .  
We express deep concern about the use of new information technologies , such as the Internet , for purposes contrary to respect for human values , equality , non-discrimination , respect for others and tolerance , including to propagate racism , racial hatred , xenophobia , racial discrimination and related intolerance , and that children and youth have access to this material ; others / [ respect and tolerance for diversity ] ; [ and urge their continued and enhanced use in this respect ; ] .  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
Urges States to take all necessary measures to address , as a matter of urgency , the pressing requirement for justice for the victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and to ensure that victims have full access to information , support , effective protection and national , administrative and judicial remedies , as well as legal assistance , including the right to seek and receive just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for material and moral damage ;  
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
The Unit otherwise supports the work of NGOs by disseminating international human rights promotional and training material and developing a mechanism through which information collated and analysed by the Unit and East Timorese NGOs will be preserved and accessible for future use .  
They urged that Israel should be required to pay reparations for the material losses resulting from its aggression against the occupied Palestinian territories , such as the destruction of urban and rural installations , as well as for the many Palestinian lives that have been lost , the serious wounds that have been inflicted and the permanent disabilities that have been caused , as has been the case in the past when compensation has been paid to victims of aggression in similar cases . 
A possible strategy is to establish such a capacity gradually , by assisting in developing requisite training / pedagogical material and by providing assistance in course delivery in a developing country on a regional basis jointly with local professional associations ( freight forwarders , exporters etc . ) and / or academic institutions .  
Quoting rule 4 of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities , 4 the Committee stated that , in addition to the need to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to adequate food , accessible housing and other basic material needs , it was also necessary to ensure that support services , including assisting devices were available for persons with disabilities , so as to assist them in increasing their level of independence in their daily life and in exercising their rights .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
With the strengthening and upgrading of the former Logistics Communications Service to the Logistics Support Division , due attention is given to the magnitude and level of responsibilities in terms of providing all United Nations peacekeeping operations and field political offices with the technical and domestic accommodation , communications , transportation , information technology , engineering , utilities , material supply , contracting services , medical support , detailed logistics planning and supporting coordination which they need for cost-effective and efficient performance of their mandates .  
Stressing that , in accordance with article 27 , paragraph 2 , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) , of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the right to protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific , literary or artistic production of which one is the author is a human right , subject to limitations in the public interest ,  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
Therefore , besides the legal instruments prohibiting weapons of mass destruction , it is vitally important today for the international community to promote closer cooperation to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material , combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and enhance the protection and control of nuclear facilities against acts of terrorism and sabotage .
