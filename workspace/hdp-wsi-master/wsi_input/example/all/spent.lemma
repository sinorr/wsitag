Mountains had to be traversed as there was no dynamite to blast out more convenient detours . In constant fear of aboriginal raids , builders cleared a wide area in order to discourage aboriginal attacks . Forts , outposts and military encampments were also set up at varying intervals along the course of the route . Chang Yeh Yi-hu , a first lieutenant in the Japanese army , spent 17 days travelling the trail .  
Equipment was often second-hand , bought from a foreign resident , or sometimes made by an eager enthusiast . These early disciples of the sport recall the crazy extremes their love for this new activity went to . In the pouring rain , or braving the damp chill of winter in wet suits , they spent hours learning the finer points of this exciting sport .  
These observations coincide closely with records concerning saris in the Buddhist scriptures . " The article went on to explain that " the reasons for the formation of gallstones can be hereditary , or one 's natural physical constitution , while the majority stem from a lack of physical excercise , a build-up of bile in the gallbladder , or irregular eating habits . . . .

It 's not like a lot of magazines that just skim over things superficially and after you 're done you ca n't remember a word you 've read . That two seasoned reporters spent three hours of their time interviewing for an article of something over l , 000 words with two photographs shows admirable dedication . Competition overseas must be intense , and it 's not easy for a magazine to be held in esteem both at home and abroad .  
What impressed me most about the museum was not only the amazing collections , the good preservation , the quality of the abundant publications or the nice the tea-room and garden ; I spent a lot of time talking with the museum staff , even going to the store rooms to see and discuss various items with them .

Pacific Construction , a real estate company chain that adopted a lot of parks , found itself scolded by some city council members as engaged in advertising and commercial activities , maybe because its signs were too conspicuous . " We thought we were going to raise our corporate image , and instead we spent all that money and wound up getting yelled at , " they say , feeling much abused .

Developing countries can not be expected to have the depth of accumulated research of say , the data going back 100 years on average for every trout and salmon species in Europe and America , or one rare British species of lycaenid butterfly which has been researched for thirty or forty years , or researchers in the mold of the British entomologist R.H.L . Disney , who has spent 25 years completing over 100 papers about " scuttle flies , " which most people have never even heard of .  
The Formosan landlocked salmon was the main reason for the establishment of Shei-Pa National Park ; the Formosan clouded leopard was fielded by the newly formed Green Party as its presidential candidate ; and NT $ 200 million has been spent on the rehabilitation of the Formosan sika deer . But by the ecological definition , because these three species ' wild populations are so small that they can no longer reproduce healthily , in effect they are already extinct .  
It has spent a great amount of funds on a few species like the Formosan landlocked salmon and the Formosan sika , but concern for the maroon oriole and other species is conspicuously absent . A huge quantity of cash is spent on rebuilding sika deer numbers , but the southern cross-island highway will be allowed to divide the Mt . Tawu clouded leopard nature preserve .  
To keep the will of heaven secret , the imperial astronomers of ancient China were forbidden to leave the capital . Although treated leniently if they committed crimes , even in old age they could never retire or return to their native places . They can surely never have guessed that the lonely months and years they spent staring through sighting tubes to record whatever changes they saw in the vastness of the heavens would make such a great contribution to the astronomy of later ages .  
Of Mr . Shih 's six years of employment , he spent the first three doing clerical work in the inspection department of a pharmaceuticals manufacturer .

Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
Looking back over his life , the first half was spent at the center of momentous events while , in the second half , history has continued to move inexorably forward without his participation . Has he really just these few lines as his testimony ? Before his oral history is published in 2002 we can only understand him from the books that have been written about him .  
The Taipei District Court ruled that although the topic of Ho Ya-wei 's report-about how Huang Chao-fu had spent NT $ 20 million in his first campaign as a KMT nominee for the legislature but received only 200 votes-could be described as " fair game . . . its sarcasm virtually dripped from the page . . . Because this affected the reputation of the plaintiff 's private moral character , the defendant was clearly acting maliciously . "  
In his autobiography , Chang reveals that the key period which shaped his life was the year he spent at Harvard at age 18 . Compulsory courses there included an extensive review of the Western classics , and this not only allowed him to become familiar with the development of Western culture , but also laid down the foundations of his understanding of the humanities .  
A research study on " Women and the Community " conducted by the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University revealed that environmental and quality-of-life issues are what concern women most in community after community . For the vast majority of women , their community-including nearby public facilities such as markets , parks and schools-is where their lives are centered and the bulk of their time is spent . Naturally , they are very sensitive to changes in the environment where they pass their days .  
Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education .

But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
Huang Wen-jung relates that , as most golf courses are located away from the cities , the 3-4 hours spent in a round of golf allow players to walk around and take in fresh air , aiding respiratory functions . Golf requires players to stand up straight , stand firmly at the legs , knees , and back , and to squat down to check wind direction and the lie of the grass . Therefore , requiring the use of the arms , wrists , and abdominal muscles , it qualifies as an ideal athletic pursuit .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .  
Written as a conversation among three people , in poking fun at the nobility and the emperor who spent all day hunting rather than in affairs of state , it also depicted a vast and colorful world : Sima exhausted his imagination to describe natural wonders , strange creatures and bizarre plants , presenting a dazzling and awesome spectacle .  
Of course , during the half century of life spent here , in which he married , raised children , and had a successful career , people from Shandong looked after each other , but the genuine selflessness of the people in Taiwan was like a loving mother consoling the hearts of these exiled sons . Pa 's feelings about Taiwan are without a shred of pretense .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color .

You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others . It declaims : " You could say that , prior to the ascendance of Western power , Zhu Xi had the greatest influence on East Asian civilization of any one individual . His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs .

He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement . They argued that the new government 's chief concerns should instead be with practical measures such as instituting work management controls and tracking down how reconstruction money was embezzled after the quake . It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music . The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .

Not wanting waste this gift , he has found an outlet for it on paper , allowing future generations of Taiwanese to know how their ancestors spent their days toiling and getting calluses on their hands . Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
" If we 're going to be in this game we have to be in at the forefront , " says Chen Ming-tang , who joined the AMiBA program after being involved in SMART . He spent the whole of last year designing and thinking about the new project .

This goes far beyond Huang 's original expectations , for he was motivated solely by a love for the aesthetic sensibility of Victorian England , with the delicate beauty of its art , architecture , furniture , and decorative style . That is precisely what is lacking in Taiwan , where people have spent the last several decades pouring most of their energies into economic development .  
On his one previous visit in the winter of 1958 , accompanied by his mother , Taipei always seemed grayish and wet as it was raining most of the time . A child prodigy with a phenomenal memory , Joppert never forgot the rainy month he spent here .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million . The Kaohsiung City Election Commission , following established precedent , was only able to levy a paltry fine of NT $ 100,000 . In addition to amending the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , there is a pressing need to enact legislation that will stamp out black gold corruption and provide for greater transparency .  
In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film . Not only was it the most expensive of all his previous works , but the actual filming was also the most painstaking . Each day , as work began , two to three hours were spent on setting up lighting alone , in an attempt to bring out the essence of middle-class urban life . The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life .

Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .

Kuo says that it is impossible to see how Diamond Stage had real respect for these low-status people . Most of the time in the " social concern segments " was spent in bantering among the hosts ( who got their start doing vulgar " dinner shows " ) and the guest star . Was it supposed to express respect just because the hosts bowed and said something like " that looked like hard work " at the end ?  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead .

" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
Banu Gabamumu , president of their cultural development association , spent many days inspecting the damage in the Shao ancestral lands around Sun Moon Lake . On seeing how the earthquake had almost split Kuanghua Island into pieces , he said : " This place , which we call Lalu , used to be the home of our highest ancestral spirit . But later it was occupied by the Han Chinese spirit the Old Man Under the Moon . Perhaps now our ancestor has grown angry , and wants to take back the land He lost . "  
Huang Wen-jung relates that , as most golf courses are located away from the cities , the 3-4 hours spent in a round of golf allow players to walk around and take in fresh air , aiding respiratory functions . Golf requires players to stand up straight , stand firmly at the legs , knees , and back , and to squat down to check wind direction and the lie of the grass . Therefore , requiring the use of the arms , wrists , and abdominal muscles , it qualifies as an ideal athletic pursuit .  
If you only knew about these two , you would think that the women of the Han court either spent their days relying on their beauty as weapons in internecine power struggles , or ended up getting married off to the ruler of a distant land to cement some strategic alliance . A code of proper female conduct was explicitly prescribed for the first time by two books that were written about 2,000 years ago .

Of course , during the half century of life spent here , in which he married , raised children , and had a successful career , people from Shandong looked after each other , but the genuine selflessness of the people in Taiwan was like a loving mother consoling the hearts of these exiled sons . Pa 's feelings about Taiwan are without a shred of pretense .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color .

You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others . It declaims : " You could say that , prior to the ascendance of Western power , Zhu Xi had the greatest influence on East Asian civilization of any one individual . His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
In particular , the group lambasted the government for the NT $ 200 million it had spent in vain on a reconstruction plan designed by academics that was impossible to implement . They argued that the new government 's chief concerns should instead be with practical measures such as instituting work management controls and tracking down how reconstruction money was embezzled after the quake . It called upon the government to put an end to the tradition of plans that are unfeasible and good for nothing but creating a lot of hot air .  
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music . The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .

Collected together , these paintings make for a lively history of life in a Taiwanese farming village of the past .  
The Western-led model of environmental protection that focused on rescuing a few big creatures , like the panda , rhino , and whale , has failed . Despite huge sums of money spent on these causes , as in the case of the Formosan landlocked salmon , these species remain threatened . Meanwhile , micro-organisms of far greater importance to mankind are given the cold shoulder .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
" If we 're going to be in this game we have to be in at the forefront , " says Chen Ming-tang , who joined the AMiBA program after being involved in SMART . He spent the whole of last year designing and thinking about the new project .

In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
This goes far beyond Huang 's original expectations , for he was motivated solely by a love for the aesthetic sensibility of Victorian England , with the delicate beauty of its art , architecture , furniture , and decorative style . That is precisely what is lacking in Taiwan , where people have spent the last several decades pouring most of their energies into economic development .  
On his one previous visit in the winter of 1958 , accompanied by his mother , Taipei always seemed grayish and wet as it was raining most of the time . A child prodigy with a phenomenal memory , Joppert never forgot the rainy month he spent here .  
For this reason , he has spent decades assiduously researching the " genes " of Chinese characters , to analyze the basic structure of Chinese writing on the basis of six essential factors : the characters ' constituent elements ; the sequence of those elements ; the shapes of the strokes and stroke combinations that make up the characters ; recognition features ; sound ( in those characters with a phonetic element ) ; and meaning . Using these factors , Chu hopes to make computers " understand " the concepts underlying the Chinese writing system .  
The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million . The Kaohsiung City Election Commission , following established precedent , was only able to levy a paltry fine of NT $ 100,000 . In addition to amending the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , there is a pressing need to enact legislation that will stamp out black gold corruption and provide for greater transparency .  
In a coffee shop smelling of stale cigarette smoke and pipe tobacco , Lin reflects on his new film .

The Cruise of Robinson portrays a real-estate agent who makes his home in a hotel .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
A doctor from a health center located in a southern county , who wishes to remain anonymous , says that when SARS hit , because the center had been converted into a treatment center , more than half their time was spent in examining patients rather than doing general epidemic prevention work . Indeed , even now the government lacks a clear focus for future tasks such as promoting cervical examinations , encouraging neighborhood environmental hygiene , or taking preventive measures against chronic diseases .  
" It 's the plainness of rice straw that attracts people to it , " says Kao Hsi-lin . " It gives rise to a desire for a natural , rustic life . " Kao is a vibrant man who builds installations , paints and studies creative media . After several years spent working on community building , he is now giving new life to rice straw , a material that the people of Jenju had previously thought of as a waste product .

Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
For Chiang Wei-shui personally , the 144 days that he spent in prison as a result of his two arrests connected with the incident provided him with an opportunity to do more reading and thinking .

Of the 34 lighthouses Taiwan has built on its coasts and nearby islands , Huang Ching-jung has been a keeper for 27 , more than any other person in the country . Forty-five of the 75 years of his life have been spent among the lighthouses . Although he has been retired for ten years , Huang has still not lost his feeling for the lighthouses . He uses discarded pipes to make models of the lighthouses that he puts in his home , and in many dreams late at night he is still connected to the lighthouses .  
Both Mori and another Japanese expert who spent much time deep in Taiwan 's mountain regions , naturalist Kana Tadao , concluded , " Generally speaking the tribespeople have a powerful sense of blood ties , with this feeling being strongest among the Bunun . " For example , whereas the Atayal , high mountain dwellers like the Bunun , had internal divisions and even wars among themselves , the Bunun were very loyal to the group , maintaining unity against outsiders .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent . Thanks to a high 13-degree sugar / acid ratio ( sugar content / free acid content ) and free media publicity thrown in by the home distribution company , the day after the ads appeared the borough head , Chang Jui-tuan , who was responsible for taking phone orders , spent the whole day on the phone .  
Their medicinal work was mostly done at night , after their day 's farmwork was done . Kung had loved drawing since childhood , and spent all his money on art supplies for his hobby .

I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
Despite a large degree of convergence on many of the issues that will be addressed by this convention , we feel constrained to reiterate that , for countries like India , whose nuclear programme is based on a closed fuel cycle , it would not be possible to consider including spent fuel in a convention dealing with the safety of radioactive waste management .  
They shall also be granted reasonable official time to prepare for and attend meetings of related bodies , to represent staff in joint advisory bodies and to conduct their representational activities ( such as meetings with supervisors or managers ) , provided that the proportion of the official time spent on representational activities should not be unreasonable in relation to their performance of assigned duties ;

For example , in trade policy , when a low uniform tariff rate is applied to all products , any extra amount spent on luxury goods deprives the industrial sector of scarce foreign exchange .  
From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .

Motivated by the need to protect the health and safety or our population and our environment , we believe that these efforts should continue , thus promoting the adoption of mechanisms that will provide sufficient guarantees to all the States concerned that the strictest safety measures will be applied in the international maritime transport of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel , and that any damage resulting from accidents in connection with such operations will be made good .  
For the island States , whether in the Caribbean or the Pacific , the international maritime transportation of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels is a real security threat , all the more serious because most of those potentially affected are small countries lacking the resources to cope with a crisis of such magnitude , caused by big countries and by technologies that those small countries do not control .  
That violence is particularly evident during raids in which large numbers of more or less arbitrary and often violent arrests are made , often on the basis of being the wrong sort 8 ] , and the burden of proof of legal status rests with the accused : many foreigners , even South Africans , have spent months in prison like this , as their status can sometimes be difficult to determine .
