The current period has been particularly important for this new international organization : the principal organs of the Authority - the Assembly , the 36-member Council and the Secretariat - have all been established , together with the subsidiary expert bodies , and the organizational work required to assume the substantive functions entrusted to the Authority by Part XI of the Convention and by the 1994 Agreement has been initiated .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .

Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 38 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Much remained to be done to advance the cause in terms of the tasks assigned to the Commissions and expert meetings , for the main challenge ahead was to perfect a pragmatic approach that would enable the international community to deal with the development problem in a globalized world economy and to endow UNCTAD with efficient and modern instruments for helping the developing countries to meet this challenge .  
The expert members of the Preparatory Committee , who represented a variety of national legal systems , were eminently qualified to prepare a comprehensive and widely acceptable proposal , provided that sufficient time was set aside for that purpose .  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
Mechanisms should continue to be developed within the United Nations to give the nominated representatives of indigenous organizations and peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice and take part in decision-making in the search for solutions to the problems faced by their peoples .

The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
At the same time the Commission further defined the mandate of the expert by requesting him to coordinate his efforts with other international actors in the field , to prepare a comprehensive plan concerning the excavation of mass graves and the exhumation of mortal remains , and to assume responsibility for securing appropriate support , including financial assistance , for these tasks .  
While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .  
They include : a Swedish firm with a successful record of restructuring private companies , which helped in the design and start-up of the overall change process , and whose former chief executive officer continues to advise UNDP 2001 ; a Canadian expert on change management ; an American expert on public sector change ; and a leading information technology management group from the United States .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
There are four main types of statistical activity and output : ( a ) methodological studies and the convening of ad hoc expert group meetings with a view to the formulation of international recommendations and guidelines for data collection ; ( b ) parliamentary services to intergovernmental bodies , consisting of reports and substantive servicing of intergovernmental meetings ; ( c ) compilation of international statistics into databases and the dissemination of the data in them through statistical publications , on-line access and customized data services ; and ( d ) support to technical cooperation projects .  
There is broad agreement on the need for the active involvement of expert groups from among national statistical offices in the elaboration of definitions and measurement standards on complex social phenomena and in the elaboration of classification systems for critical economic issues and the environment . 
Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .

The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
The Committee holds a closed meeting after the constructive dialogue with each State party in order to consider the main issues and tendencies to be reflected in the concluding comment relating to the report of the State party .  4 .  The expert nominated as main country rapporteur drafts the comment in close collaboration with the back-up rapporteur , the general rapporteur of the Committee and the secretariat .  
When the Human Rights Committee considered France 's report in 1983 , an extremely instructive debate took place on the validity of the reservations made by France to article 4 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 35 The expert from the German Democratic Republic asserted that France had confirmed that reservations to article 4 were permissible , in response to which the representative of France said that the reservations were limited to paragraph 1 of that article . 
The United Nations to create an international legal basis for the process of redirecting nuclear missile potential to the objectives stipulated in Agenda 21 and to ensure the financing of an international expert analysis of the attendant positive and negative factors ,  
Over the years , there has been a continuing and active participation of IMF and the World Bank in the meetings of the principal organs of the United Nations in the economic and social fields particularly at the Council and the main Committees of the General Assembly ; as well as in subsidiary bodies and expert group meetings .  
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In that connection , an expert group headed by the Minister of Justice and composed of representatives of governmental agencies , non-governmental and indigenous organizations and scientists and academics had been set up to elaborate a national policy with regard to indigenous people and to contribute to the lawmaking process in that new area of national legislation .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .  
The Secretary-General proposed to convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
In coming up with the recommendations contained in paragraph 79 ( d ) , the Panel benefited greatly from the presence of a Canadian expert among its members and through him received valuable inputs from the Canadian Government based on its extensive past experiences and lessons learnt in connection with the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations .  
The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
The secretariat convened five international expert working groups to study aspects of early-warning as they relate to geological hazards , hydrometeorlogical hazards including drought , technological hazards , the use and transfer of modern technology , and national and local capabilities pertinent to early-warning .  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
The parties agreed on a list of priority sites and a preliminary timetable for the clearing of unburied mortal remains , and established a joint expert commission consisting of two forensic pathologists from each party , with the task of implementing the agreed _ upon inter-party exhumations .  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Past experience , together with results from expert group meetings and the interactive dialogues to be held during the Commission in 1997 , may serve as a basis for identifying measures which could help to accelerate progress in achieving equality between men and women in the critical areas of concern identified at Beijing as crucial for eliminating discrimination against women and enabling women around the world to fully enjoy their human rights .  
In connection with item 3 of the provisional agenda , and in accordance with paragraph 4 of its agreed conclusions on enterprise development strategy ( see annex I ) , the Commission decided to convene an expert meeting on The respective roles of government and the private sector , including NGOs , and the interactions between them in creating a coherent policy framework and setting up effective support measures and structures for the development of SMEs and micro-enterprises , in particular those in least developed countries .  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 10 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein which address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,

Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
Seven ad hoc expert group meetings on environment statistics , vital statistics and civil registration systems ; compilation of trade statistics ; the computerization of national accounts , international economic and social classifications ( two expert meetings ) ; review of UNESIS draft standards for data structure and metadata in international data exchange and dissemination ; ( i ) Sixty-nine recurrent publications . 
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
In this connection , the expert group stressed the importance of the progressive development and codification of relevant norms of international law ( e.g . the law of State responsibility , including countermeasures in response to international wrongful acts or prior injury ) as well as specific enforcement provisions or mechanisms incorporated in international regimes , which provide a universally accepted basis for judging the legitimacy of the use of economic coercion under certain circumstances ( see sect .  B below ) .  
The expert group confirmed that the basic principles of international law to be applied in assessing the legality of coercive economic measures are those of non-intervention and non-discrimination , based on such norms as the sovereignty and sovereign equality of States and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means .  
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
The expert group expressed deep concern about the potential adverse effects of coercive economic measures on the structure of international relations , in particular in the area of trade and development .  
The expert group agreed that the problems raised by the imposition of coercive economic measures , including their economic , social , political and legal aspects , deserve increased attention by the international community and multilateral bodies .  
This set of activities also includes acquisition and distribution of reference samples of drugs under international control , their metabolites and of controlled chemicals and precursors to national laboratories in developing countries , drug-testing laboratories participating in the international collaborative exercises , regional training centres and collaborating institutions ; production and distribution of drug and precursor identification kits to law enforcement agencies ; and organization of expert group meetings on laboratory methodologies and standard guidelines .  
Activities include : preparing working documents and a draft report of the Board on the implementation of article 12 of the 1988 Convention ; providing Governments with relevant information to determine the legitimacy of shipments of precursor chemicals and to advise them regarding decisions on specific suspicious shipments ; preparing critical review documents and other relevant materials for the Board and its advisory expert group and for establishing a limited international special surveillance list ; and providing substantive advice on activities related to precursor control .  
This would achieve the objective sought by the Secretary-General without imposing any artificial delays or changing the standing of the Committee as an expert subsidiary body of the Council .  Yours sincerely ,  
The independent expert considered that the advisory services programme had not provided sufficient support for surveys required prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or for the preparation of reports by States in need of assistance .  
Japan has suggested that the words which should be close to those applied to the major narcotic drugs should be added at the end of subparagraph 20 ( b ) , in order to make it consistent with the original recommendation of the expert meeting held at Shanghai .  
The human rights treaty system , established under the six operative international human rights treaties , consists of a voluntary system of self-monitoring by way of reporting , supervised by six independent and expert international committees .  
It also included a compilation of the views of Committee members on the report of the independent expert on the functioning of the human rights treaty bodies and addressed issues raised at the eighth meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty bodies .  
Other relevant activities included a recent expert round table on benchmarks for economic , social and cultural rights ( 25 March 1998 ) , organized by the Office of the High Commissioner .  
One expert from a developing country which had announced the introduction of a GSP for LDCs raised the question of the proper legal accommodation under WTO rules for autonomous preferential market access for LDCs .  
As the expert had already observed , the greatest challenge faced by Haiti is to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable judicial system available to all .  
The team recommended that no further verification of Iraq 's current biological weapons full , final and complete disclosure be conducted at the senior international expert level , until Iraq commits itself to provide substantive , new information .  
To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Following clarification of conceptual , terminological and normative ambiguities remaining in the guidelines , through a broad consultative process , the expert plans to ensure that the Guidelines and Principles can gain wide international support and be formulated in a way that can best advance the right of victims to compensation , reparation and restitution for human rights violations .  
With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
We were responsible for convening the first periodic meeting on international humanitarian law , which in January 1998 dealt with the protection of humanitarian personnel and so-called unstructured conflicts , and also the expert meeting on the Fourth Geneva Convention , which in October 1998 considered general problems relating to the implementation of the Convention in general and in occupied territories .  
In its decision 1997 / 103 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to request the Chairman of the Commission , in consultation with the regional groups , to appoint an independent expert to study the effects of structural adjustment policies on economic , social and cultural rights , to be submitted to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session . 
In its decision 1998 / 102 , the Commission requested the independent expert to submit his report as envisioned in decision 1997 / 103 for consideration by the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights , which is scheduled to meet from 1 to 5 March 1999 . 
There is an impressive amount of expert knowledge and diplomatic skills concentrated in this room , and time and again our deliberations , which approach the subject matter from different , even opposing , viewpoints , have produced new and valuable insights and helped to clarify and develop national positions in no insignificant way .  
Depending on their specific mandate , field presences implement technical cooperation programmes to support governmental and civil society institutions in strengthening their capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights , through training , legal assistance , expert advice , public education and other activities .  
As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
The Sub-Commission 's working methods in respect of its research and study projects should , consistent with the independent expert character of the body , entail a well-prepared , thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question , any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission . 
The resources proposed reflect a net growth of $ 701,400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .

The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .  
Affirms that the informal consultations on measures to ensure international protection for all who need it have proved to be a valuable forum for constructive discussion of complex protection issues in an open manner ; and requests UNHCR , in consultation with States , to continue to organize from time to time , within the limits of available resources , and with broadly based participation , informal expert consultations on protection issues of current concern .  
An expert from a low-income country reported that the major objective of his country 's agricultural policy was to produce enough food grains and other agricultural commodities for direct consumption or for use as raw materials in agro-processing industries , and the problem for the country was not so much in terms of competition in the world market for exports but how to compete with cheap imports from outside , an excess inflow of which could be economically and socially destabilizing .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Meetings : two are planned for 2000 , with the leadership or close collaboration of the United Nations programme on ageing an expert examination of the interaction of social technologies and multigenerational ties ( supported by the Government of the United Kingdom and being organized by HelpAge International ) ; and an international conference on rural ageing ( being organized by the University of West Virginia ) .  
Three other meetings are being considered for 2000 a conference of national focal points ( at the initiative of the Government of Malta ) ; an expert group on midlife adjustments for resourceful ageing ( seeking the involvement of the media and research communities ) ; and resourceful ageing and the workplace ( with the corporate sector ) ;  
A series of round tables , expert meetings and regional consultations have been organized on key issues , such as adolescent sexual and reproductive health ( New York , 1417 April 1998 ) and implementing reproductive rights and implementing sexual and reproductive health programmes , including womens empowerment , male involvement and human rights ( 2225 June 1998 ) .  
The independent expert was nevertheless glad that , on the whole , the situation was handled with great sang-froid , but called upon all concerned to strive to create conditions conducive to the emergence of a social compact .  
During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
The independent expert is closely associated with the implementation of this component , particularly since he shares the MICIVIH approach of according absolute priority to strengthening the network of local NGOs engaged in protecting human rights , a priority which is all the more justified because , to the great regret of the independent expert , the mandate of MICIVIH could not be renewed . 
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
Poland expressed the view that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States constitutes a positive step towards the implementation of the provisions of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
In order to create and maintain such political will , it is important to give broad publicity to this issue by widely disseminating relevant information on the subject , including the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly , and above all by publicizing the costs borne by a few countries in supporting the decisions of the Security Council adopted in the name of the international community as a whole .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will .  
UNCTAD should do analytical work and provide a forum for exchanges of experiences at intergovernmental and at expert level on the formulation of policies favourable to the development of the private sector at local , national and regional levels .  
Under the terms of operative paragraph 12 , the General Assembly would , inter alia , request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene expert meetings , as requested in previous General Assembly resolutions in the past , to study and update the international legislation in force and to propose recommendations for a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make for more efficient prevention and punishment of mercenary activities .  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Following a brief introduction of the subject by the Chairman-Rapporteur and the independent expert , Ms . Anne-Marie Lizin , the first meeting of the workshop was devoted to a general discussion focusing on three major topics : sociological and political aspects , causes , types and situations of poverty ; the title of a possible draft declaration ; and the main orientations of a possible declaration .  
However , the workshop considered that the drafting mandate , which would focus on the rights-based approach , should be entrusted to the Sub-Commission as an expert body , while pursuing the usual broad consultative procedure involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the specialized agencies and all parties concerned .  
Providing expert advice to help improve the quality of justice rendered , supporting judicial reform , helping to revamp the inhumane prison system , improving the human rights conduct of the new police force and facilitating the emergence of new state and civic institutions are essential elements of the Missions activities in the area of institution-building .  
An expert group meeting , convened from 31 March to 2 April 1998 , in cooperation with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) , reviewed a comprehensive overview of the range of problems and issues which need to be addressed to improve statistics on paid and unpaid work , and defined activities which the project could carry out at the international , regional and national levels .  
Moreover , accusations have been based on highly questionable expert reports , such as autopsies failing to meet technical requirements or ballistic tests performed on manipulated evidence , as in the Xamn case , or superfluous procedures , such as the ballistic test performed on hogs in the same case .  
As mentioned in my last report ( S / 1999 / 987 ) , UNMIK has also established other consultative mechanisms through which the local population and leadership have been able to participate in the decision-making of the interim administration by providing expert guidance and advice to UNMIK on specific issues , for example in the fields of legislative matters , humanitarian affairs , economic policy , health , education , energy and public utilities .  
The expert group agreed that the Ombudsman Institute would be set up primarily to protect the rights and freedoms of all legal entities in Kosovo , by monitoring the activity of the Interim Civil Administration and emerging local institutions prior to and following provisional elections .  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will . 21 bis .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
The Commission examined the issue in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , and reported its conclusions to the Assembly in its annual reports for those years . 4 The responses of the Commission were based on extensive consultations and studies in the context of which it had sought advice from ACPAQ , its expert technical body on post adjustment , and the views of a legal consultant and several legal experts , the Legal Counsel of the United Nations and the legal advisers of the organizations . 
This report contained the conclusions and a summary of deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting , held in New York from 24 to 28 June 1998 , concerning the development of a possible methodology for assessing the consequences actually incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and the exploration of innovative and practical measures of international assistance that could be provided to said third States .  
In addition , the Commission on Human Rights has established special procedures mandates covering economic and social rights and the right to development , including the appointment of an independent expert on structural adjustment policies , special rapporteurs on the right to education and on foreign debt , and independent experts on extreme poverty and the right to development .  
The proposed resources reflect a net growth of $ 701 , 400 , or 5.5 per cent , required for , inter alia , the preparatory activities of the special session of the General Assembly in 2001 , organization of global and regional preparatory expert meetings and travel related to the preparatory activities and additional requirements for other staff costs and equipment .

As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
The Committee took note of the Harare expert group meeting in January 1998 , which concluded that integrated water resources management is essential for reconciling the interests of all actors in the river basin whether national or international regarding water quantity , quality and ecosystem protection .  
Moreover , in the light of the federal structure of Canada and the extensive provincial jurisdiction , the absence of any expert particularly representing the largest provinces , other than Quebec , significantly limited the potential depth of the dialogue on key issues .  
After an inventory had been drawn up of all these sets of barrels , the SBC expert concluded that it was impossible to determine the contents of the barrels without the assistance of teams of toxicologists equipped with suitable analytical instruments and protective gear .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
In his report to the General Assembly ( A 53-355 , para . 22 ) , the independent expert on Haiti reported that over the past year , Haiti had begun facing the challenge of putting into place a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable and accessible justice system .  
In its decision 1998-102 , the Commission decided to authorize the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights to meet for one week , at least four weeks before the fifty _ fifth session of the Commission , to consider the report of the independent expert and the comments received thereon and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In its resolution 1998 59 , the Commission requested the independent expert to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical cooperation through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector .  
Since her appointment , the independent expert held permanent consultations with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and visited several countries ( Albania , Bulgaria , France , Portugal and Yemen ) where she held consultations with Governments , international organizations , United Nations bodies , Programmes and Funds , as well as key non _ governmental organizations with extensive knowledge on human rights and extreme poverty .  
A meeting with the independent expert should be organized in 1999 in order to draw up for the international community the basic elements of a preliminary draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
This objective will be pursued through coordination and outreach programmes for encouraging networking and coalition-building among non-governmental organizations , ensuring their substantive contribution to the Council and its subsidiary bodies and in the follow-up to global conferences to secure expert information and advice from non-governmental organizations and to provide training and capacity-building as required .  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
The aim of the Union continues to be to promote , coordinate and develop at the international level the role of the notary as a technical and legal expert who ensures impartiality in private contractual relations , with the ultimate aim of forestalling and preventing controversies and conflicts .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .

But over and above traditional legal aid , which is generally limited to criminal matters , the expert emphasized the need to help rural people to use common law as an instrument to improve their rights situation .  
The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .  
The Security Council has addressed this issue of constructive dialogue and effective support through the establishment of expert panels and mechanisms , and some sanctions committees are looking into improving cooperation with regional and international organizations involved in the implementation of Security Council sanctions .

The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
In addition , the methodology moves away from an expert approach , in which the communication expert produces the communication component of the programme , towards participatory communication planning , where all of the countrys team members ( from government , UNICEF , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations ) are involved in the planning , with beneficial results in terms of sharing and learning skills as well as ownership of the final product , which has in itself important implications for the implementation of the strategic communication plan developed .  
The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue to coordinate activities on this issue and to organize an expert meeting to review progress on the development of the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil , to broaden participation and build scientific understanding of this subject before its sixteenth session , and to prepare a report for that session .  
In view of the suggestions that emerged from the first expert meeting and the text of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001 / 3 , it is recommended that the Special Rapporteur should continue to study mercenary activities as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination but should also take into account other situations in which mercenaries are involved , including illicit trafficking , terrorism , the use of mercenaries by private security companies to intervene in the internal affairs of States and organized crime .  
In its resolution 54 / 135 of 17 December 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant international organizations , specialized agencies , funds and programmes , and in consultation with Member States , to prepare a comprehensive report on the situation of rural women and challenges faced by them , based , inter alia , on the outcome of an expert group meeting , which would draw from the contributions and case studies provided by experts from various regions and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session .

Subscribes to the remarks of the expert to the effect that various obstacles linked to the realization of the right of everyone to drinking water supply and sanitation seriously impede the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , and that equality is an essential element for effective participation in the realization of the right to development and the right to a healthy environment ;  
The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .

In carrying out his mandate , the independent expert must respect a set of basic principles to be embodied in the resolution requesting his appointment , including international cooperation based on Article 2 of the United Nations Charter , the condemnation of unilateral actions , respect for the key role of States in action to combat impunity and the obligation to determine the responsibility of the perpetrators of human rights violations as an essential component of effective compensation and international cooperation through universally applicable mechanisms . 
With regard to the possible appointment of an independent expert on the issue of impunity , the Commission stated that , as impunity is a complex topic , impunity for violations of civil and political rights and for violations of economic and social rights give rise to different problems and should be treated separately .

Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 38 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Much remained to be done to advance the cause in terms of the tasks assigned to the Commissions and expert meetings , for the main challenge ahead was to perfect a pragmatic approach that would enable the international community to deal with the development problem in a globalized world economy and to endow UNCTAD with efficient and modern instruments for helping the developing countries to meet this challenge .  
The expert members of the Preparatory Committee , who represented a variety of national legal systems , were eminently qualified to prepare a comprehensive and widely acceptable proposal , provided that sufficient time was set aside for that purpose .  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
Mechanisms should continue to be developed within the United Nations to give the nominated representatives of indigenous organizations and peoples an opportunity to provide expert advice and take part in decision-making in the search for solutions to the problems faced by their peoples .

The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
At the same time the Commission further defined the mandate of the expert by requesting him to coordinate his efforts with other international actors in the field , to prepare a comprehensive plan concerning the excavation of mass graves and the exhumation of mortal remains , and to assume responsibility for securing appropriate support , including financial assistance , for these tasks .  
While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
It is for this reason that the expert has urged the political authorities and representatives of civil society , especially the Plate-forme des organisations ha \ x { 9ba0 } iennes des droits de lhomme , to develop a sweeping programme of civic education and human rights training and to introduce legal services into rural areas .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .

50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
There are four main types of statistical activity and output : ( a ) methodological studies and the convening of ad hoc expert group meetings with a view to the formulation of international recommendations and guidelines for data collection ; ( b ) parliamentary services to intergovernmental bodies , consisting of reports and substantive servicing of intergovernmental meetings ; ( c ) compilation of international statistics into databases and the dissemination of the data in them through statistical publications , on-line access and customized data services ; and ( d ) support to technical cooperation projects .

Although the aim of producing the above-mentioned report ( which was prepared by a United Nations expert ) was not to study the problem of landmines and remnants of war and their effect on the future of the country and its development , the references to and preliminary estimates of war damages make it clear beyond any doubt that what was suffered by Libya during the military operations , and the landmines and explosives left by those operations , represented a human and material disaster of incalculable proportions . 
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .

The Committee holds a closed meeting after the constructive dialogue with each State party in order to consider the main issues and tendencies to be reflected in the concluding comment relating to the report of the State party .  4 .  The expert nominated as main country rapporteur drafts the comment in close collaboration with the back-up rapporteur , the general rapporteur of the Committee and the secretariat .  
When the Human Rights Committee considered France 's report in 1983 , an extremely instructive debate took place on the validity of the reservations made by France to article 4 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 35 The expert from the German Democratic Republic asserted that France had confirmed that reservations to article 4 were permissible , in response to which the representative of France said that the reservations were limited to paragraph 1 of that article . 
The United Nations to create an international legal basis for the process of redirecting nuclear missile potential to the objectives stipulated in Agenda 21 and to ensure the financing of an international expert analysis of the attendant positive and negative factors ,  
Over the years , there has been a continuing and active participation of IMF and the World Bank in the meetings of the principal organs of the United Nations in the economic and social fields particularly at the Council and the main Committees of the General Assembly ; as well as in subsidiary bodies and expert group meetings .  
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In that connection , an expert group headed by the Minister of Justice and composed of representatives of governmental agencies , non-governmental and indigenous organizations and scientists and academics had been set up to elaborate a national policy with regard to indigenous people and to contribute to the lawmaking process in that new area of national legislation .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .

The IDNDR secretariat successfully completed its current work programme for early warning , with regard to natural disasters , in response to Assembly resolution 50 / 117 B . Six international expert groups were convened to examine scientific knowledge and public practices that could contribute to more accurate and timely short-term forecasting and warning applications for natural and similar disasters . 
The secretariat convened five international expert working groups to study aspects of early-warning as they relate to geological hazards , hydrometeorlogical hazards including drought , technological hazards , the use and transfer of modern technology , and national and local capabilities pertinent to early-warning .  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
The parties agreed on a list of priority sites and a preliminary timetable for the clearing of unburied mortal remains , and established a joint expert commission consisting of two forensic pathologists from each party , with the task of implementing the agreed _ upon inter-party exhumations .

A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
Part of the problem is attributed to the absence of adequate national and regional capacities to deal with the problem in terms of the expert human resources required , including the need for technical , technological and infrastructural requirements .  
Any expert meetings which might be convened would function under the precise terms of reference set by the Commission , which could be guided by the Midrand mandate , in particular : ( a ) enhancing greater understanding of the relationship between globalization and the instruments of the multilateral trading system ; ( b ) maximizing the positive developmental impact of expanding trade ; ( c ) trade in services ; and ( d ) issues relating to commodity diversifications .  
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;

In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Calls upon individual donor countries , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations to incorporate human rights principles and objectives into the humanitarian and development work they carry out in Somalia and to cooperate with the independent expert ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;  
Recognizing that the people of Somalia have the principal responsibility for their national reconciliation process and that they are the ones to decide freely on their political , economic and social systems but , as stated by the independent expert , that the international community should not abandon them in this tragic period of their national history ,

Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .  
In fact , it is extremely difficult to establish a regulatory regime which is both expert and independent of capture by well-endowed enterprises ( who may be supported by strong ministers ) , nor perverted by short-term political interests .  
Seven ad hoc expert group meetings on environment statistics , vital statistics and civil registration systems ; compilation of trade statistics ; the computerization of national accounts , international economic and social classifications ( two expert meetings ) ; review of UNESIS draft standards for data structure and metadata in international data exchange and dissemination ; ( i ) Sixty-nine recurrent publications . 
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
The outcome of the expert group meeting ( possibly , in the form of methodological or technical guidelines ) should then be submitted for the consideration of Member States , whose political support both at the United Nations and in the governing bodies of the agencies concerned would be essential for universal acceptability , and effective application of such guidelines .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
In this connection , the expert group stressed the importance of the progressive development and codification of relevant norms of international law ( e.g . the law of State responsibility , including countermeasures in response to international wrongful acts or prior injury ) as well as specific enforcement provisions or mechanisms incorporated in international regimes , which provide a universally accepted basis for judging the legitimacy of the use of economic coercion under certain circumstances ( see sect .  B below ) .  
The expert group confirmed that the basic principles of international law to be applied in assessing the legality of coercive economic measures are those of non-intervention and non-discrimination , based on such norms as the sovereignty and sovereign equality of States and the obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means .  
In illustration of a " top-down " method for estimating the impact of coercive economic measures , the expert group referred itself to a recent study that attempts to empirically measure the impact of sanctions on bilateral trade flows , particularly on exports by the United States which is the most frequent sender of unilateral sanctions . 36 But the method used , a common one in economics known as the " gravity model " , also captures the impact on the trade of the target country . 
The expert group expressed deep concern about the potential adverse effects of coercive economic measures on the structure of international relations , in particular in the area of trade and development .

To ensure the universality of the revised guidelines , the expert considers it necessary to conduct an in-depth comparative study of the relevant international , regional and domestic norms of States Members of the United Nations in order to reveal patterns and trends in the application of the right to restitution , compensation and rehabilitation in cases of human rights violations .  
Following clarification of conceptual , terminological and normative ambiguities remaining in the guidelines , through a broad consultative process , the expert plans to ensure that the Guidelines and Principles can gain wide international support and be formulated in a way that can best advance the right of victims to compensation , reparation and restitution for human rights violations .  
With a view to harmonizing the guidelines with existing forms of remedy , the expert considers it necessary to conduct a systematic review of forms of rights and remedies as they pertain to the mandate , the ways and means of the individual right of access by nationals and aliens before national legal bodies , and finally , the question of international legal consequences for failure to provide substantive redress for such right of procedural access to judicial and administrative bodies .  
Given the large number of remaining complex conceptual and terminological ambiguities , the expert emphasizes that considerable research must be carried out before the guidelines can be substantively revised in a manner that harmonizes them with laws and procedures already developed at international , regional and national levels .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .

The independent expert was nevertheless glad that , on the whole , the situation was handled with great sang-froid , but called upon all concerned to strive to create conditions conducive to the emergence of a social compact .  
During his stay in Haiti , the independent expert observed multiple human rights violations throughout the judicial system , which is supposed to be the principal guarantor of such rights .  
The independent expert is closely associated with the implementation of this component , particularly since he shares the MICIVIH approach of according absolute priority to strengthening the network of local NGOs engaged in protecting human rights , a priority which is all the more justified because , to the great regret of the independent expert , the mandate of MICIVIH could not be renewed . 
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
The independent expert expresses the hope that all actors will help to create conditions that will allow the electoral process to continue without incident so that free , democratic and transparent elections can be held with the broadest possible participation by the Haitian people .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
Poland expressed the view that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States constitutes a positive step towards the implementation of the provisions of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
In order to create and maintain such political will , it is important to give broad publicity to this issue by widely disseminating relevant information on the subject , including the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly , and above all by publicizing the costs borne by a few countries in supporting the decisions of the Security Council adopted in the name of the international community as a whole .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will .

Following a brief introduction of the subject by the Chairman-Rapporteur and the independent expert , Ms . Anne-Marie Lizin , the first meeting of the workshop was devoted to a general discussion focusing on three major topics : sociological and political aspects , causes , types and situations of poverty ; the title of a possible draft declaration ; and the main orientations of a possible declaration .  
However , the workshop considered that the drafting mandate , which would focus on the rights-based approach , should be entrusted to the Sub-Commission as an expert body , while pursuing the usual broad consultative procedure involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the specialized agencies and all parties concerned .

Moreover , accusations have been based on highly questionable expert reports , such as autopsies failing to meet technical requirements or ballistic tests performed on manipulated evidence , as in the Xamn case , or superfluous procedures , such as the ballistic test performed on hogs in the same case .  
As mentioned in my last report ( S / 1999 / 987 ) , UNMIK has also established other consultative mechanisms through which the local population and leadership have been able to participate in the decision-making of the interim administration by providing expert guidance and advice to UNMIK on specific issues , for example in the fields of legislative matters , humanitarian affairs , economic policy , health , education , energy and public utilities .  
The expert group agreed that the Ombudsman Institute would be set up primarily to protect the rights and freedoms of all legal entities in Kosovo , by monitoring the activity of the Interim Civil Administration and emerging local institutions prior to and following provisional elections .  
Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness , expert or other person having had , for a period of fifteen consecutive days , or for any period agreed upon by the Parties , from the date on which he or she has been officially informed that his or her presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities , an opportunity of leaving , has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory of the requesting Party or , having left it , has returned of his or her own free will . 21 bis .

The Commission examined the issue in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , and reported its conclusions to the Assembly in its annual reports for those years . 4 The responses of the Commission were based on extensive consultations and studies in the context of which it had sought advice from ACPAQ , its expert technical body on post adjustment , and the views of a legal consultant and several legal experts , the Legal Counsel of the United Nations and the legal advisers of the organizations . 
This report contained the conclusions and a summary of deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting , held in New York from 24 to 28 June 1998 , concerning the development of a possible methodology for assessing the consequences actually incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and the exploration of innovative and practical measures of international assistance that could be provided to said third States .  
In addition , the Commission on Human Rights has established special procedures mandates covering economic and social rights and the right to development , including the appointment of an independent expert on structural adjustment policies , special rapporteurs on the right to education and on foreign debt , and independent experts on extreme poverty and the right to development .

As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
The Committee took note of the Harare expert group meeting in January 1998 , which concluded that integrated water resources management is essential for reconciling the interests of all actors in the river basin whether national or international regarding water quantity , quality and ecosystem protection .  
Moreover , in the light of the federal structure of Canada and the extensive provincial jurisdiction , the absence of any expert particularly representing the largest provinces , other than Quebec , significantly limited the potential depth of the dialogue on key issues .  
After an inventory had been drawn up of all these sets of barrels , the SBC expert concluded that it was impossible to determine the contents of the barrels without the assistance of teams of toxicologists equipped with suitable analytical instruments and protective gear .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
In his report to the General Assembly ( A 53-355 , para . 22 ) , the independent expert on Haiti reported that over the past year , Haiti had begun facing the challenge of putting into place a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable and accessible justice system .  
In its decision 1998-102 , the Commission decided to authorize the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights to meet for one week , at least four weeks before the fifty _ fifth session of the Commission , to consider the report of the independent expert and the comments received thereon and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In its resolution 1998 59 , the Commission requested the independent expert to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical cooperation through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector .  
Since her appointment , the independent expert held permanent consultations with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and visited several countries ( Albania , Bulgaria , France , Portugal and Yemen ) where she held consultations with Governments , international organizations , United Nations bodies , Programmes and Funds , as well as key non _ governmental organizations with extensive knowledge on human rights and extreme poverty .  
A meeting with the independent expert should be organized in 1999 in order to draw up for the international community the basic elements of a preliminary draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
This objective will be pursued through coordination and outreach programmes for encouraging networking and coalition-building among non-governmental organizations , ensuring their substantive contribution to the Council and its subsidiary bodies and in the follow-up to global conferences to secure expert information and advice from non-governmental organizations and to provide training and capacity-building as required .  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
The aim of the Union continues to be to promote , coordinate and develop at the international level the role of the notary as a technical and legal expert who ensures impartiality in private contractual relations , with the ultimate aim of forestalling and preventing controversies and conflicts .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .

The demand for services in the biennium 2000-2001 had been higher than originally anticipated because of , inter alia , a greater than average number of meetings of intergovernmental and expert organs and the extension of the sessions of several bodies beyond their scheduled closing dates .  Consequently , the overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 of $ 423,865,400 reflected a net increase of $ 8,488,900 , or 2 per cent , as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2000-2001 .

Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
In addition , the methodology moves away from an expert approach , in which the communication expert produces the communication component of the programme , towards participatory communication planning , where all of the countrys team members ( from government , UNICEF , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations ) are involved in the planning , with beneficial results in terms of sharing and learning skills as well as ownership of the final product , which has in itself important implications for the implementation of the strategic communication plan developed .
