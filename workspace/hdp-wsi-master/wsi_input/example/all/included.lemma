Visitors had come from all around the world to witness the opening of the largest fine arts museum in the Far East , as well as to view the ten scheduled opening exhibitions , which included a selection of international prints and the works of overseas and local Chinese artists .

Attempts were made by the first director to restore the interior to its former splendour . He had seen what Victoria 's workmen had removed and was given permission by the queen to select items from the boxes in which they lay and begin returning them to the Pavilion .

He says that it is their understanding of proper traditional rituals that makes the bando master chefs unique , and it 's something that hotel chefs lack .  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
The best base line for statistical comparisons is 1990 , when the drug problem in Taiwan became apparent for the first time after amphetamines were made controlled substances and amphetamine use began to be included in narcotics crime statistics .

Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law .

ICM researcher Chen Ta-chih first studied both folk prescriptions and those prescriptions found in ancient medical texts . He discovered that just as modern Western treatments call for injections into the penis or doses to be taken directly in the urinary canal , ancient Chinese medical texts included many similar external applications to treat impotency .  
In an attempt to rein in this flaw in human character , some legislators and members of medical associations who recognized the potential problem proposed measures to seal loopholes in the system .

At first , there was much less coverage of the Kaohsiung mayoral race .
