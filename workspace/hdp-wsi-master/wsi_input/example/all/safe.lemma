The presence of newly planted mines along some secondary roads which were previously considered safe is raising serious concerns among humanitarian agencies responsible for the distribution of agricultural assistance .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
Postponed : ( i ) inventory of existing railway line standards and parameters ; ( ii ) inventory of existing combined transport standards and parameters ; ( iii ) inventory of existing road standards and parameters ; ( iv ) compendium on safe storage of cargo in containers ; ( vii ) European Code of Inland Waterways ; ( ix ) standardized vocabulary for inland navigation ; ( xi ) environmental performance of road vehicles ; and ( xv ) glossary for transport statistics ) ;

My delegation highly appreciates the valiant and expeditious efforts of the Canadian Government in taking the lead and ensuring broad participation by the international community in the formation of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian aid and the voluntary , orderly and safe repatriation of refugees .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;

UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .

Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .

Other practices are the use of indigenous objects like the buho or bamboo in cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn baby instead of unnatural objects , like scissors , the use of which , it is believed , will influence the child to be disloyal to the family and the hanging of dried umbilical cord pusod of a newborn baby beneath the doorway or window in the belief that this will keep the infant safe from accident or harm .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes .

Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .

As the peace implementation process in Bosnia and Herzegovina enters its most critical stage , it is imperative that the relatively safe and secure environment created by the presence of the multinational force be maintained and further consolidated to ensure that all the efforts and resources invested so far will bear the desired results .  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,

Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .

Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Our overriding and ultimate concern is to ensure a clean and safe planet that is hospitable and friendly to human life , now and in the future .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
On 28 March 1997 , the Security Council adopted resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , in paragraph 2 of which it welcomed the offer made by certain Member States to establish a temporary and limited multinational protection force to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
The assembled leaders renewed their commitment to ensure that all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life .  
Established in June 1987 at Dublin , Ireland , under the initial name of the World LPG Forum , with the objective to promote worldwide the use of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) as a safe , convenient , clean and efficient fuel . 
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;  
The State and conflicting parties are required to adhere to the humanitarian imperative and facilitate safe and easy access to endangered populations and affected areas for rapid provision of humanitarian assistance ;  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
The reports of the experts are equally ominous .  A lack of safe drinking water for more than one third of the world 's population , continuing soil degradation , increasing global warming , unchecked urbanization , influxes of refugees , population growth and a failure to protect the fragile mountain ecosystem are some of the threatening signs .  
My country also highlighted the great importance of fostering sustainable development , whose objective is to harmonize human activities and nature by means of policies and actions that will achieve an efficient and fair economy , a just society and the preservation of the environment , in order to ensure a better quality of life for present and future generations in a safe environment .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Urges all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , so as to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting children ;  
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
Mr . Erds ( Hungary ) said that Hungary firmly believed that , for the scourge of terrorism to be successfully suppressed , there must be no safe havens for terrorists , and that objective could only be achieved through the establishment of a global system based on a unified international approach and effective regional cooperation .  
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , at both the national and international levels , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food , as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
In this context , the OIC Contact Group lends full support to the Secretary-General for his initiatives and diplomatic efforts in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons under international protection throughout Kosova . * Reissued for technical reasons .  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
The Council informed Mr . Rugova of its current efforts to solve the Kosovo crisis through a political settlement that would provide for the safe return of all refugees and for substantial self-government for Kosovo within the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and help abate the overheated nationalist sentiments now prevailing in the area .  
The serious intent of the Indonesian Government to fulfil its commitment is also evidenced by the establishment of a special task force at the ministerial level on 11 May 1999 , to monitor and ensure the safe and peaceful implementation of the popular consultation to be held under United Nations auspices .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .  
The main aim of IATA , the global airline trade association with a membership of 257 carriers , of which 18 are based in landlocked developing countries is to promote safe , reliable and secure services and to develop collaboration among airlines and cooperation with ICAO .

The private sector may assist the efforts of Governments , but it can not substitute for the Governments responsibility to ensure and provide quality , full , safe , accessible , affordable and convenient health services , including reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services .  
The Council expresses its concern , in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions , about the continuous erosion , in many cases , in the respect for international humanitarian and human rights law and principles , both in terms of denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need and through deliberate violence against all those protected under international humanitarian law , especially women and children .  
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;

As of January 1997 , under the technical cooperation project entitled Legislative Assistance for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy , IAEA has been supporting countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States in their national efforts to establish , develop or review the national laws governing the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to adopt implementing legislation for the international instruments to which they have adhered .  
Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
Resources should be allocated to basic priority human concerns , for example , moving away from military towards social spending and shifting the focus to better education , health services and safe water accessible to people living with poverty .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,

We are troubled to see that in a world dominated by a single military and technological Power , we are today less safe than during the difficult years of the cold war .  
By actively participating in the preparatory process for the special session on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit , my Government would like to contribute to achieving our common goals in fighting poverty , creating productive jobs and making a stable , safe and just society for all .  
For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
Without denying the importance of developing renewable power sources , we should admit that at present the only realistic industrial-scale solution to this problem is to intensify efforts to develop a safe , environmentally acceptable and economically attractive nuclear power sector.Will the nuclear power industry be equal to a task of this magnitude ?  
The Republic of Belarus notes with satisfaction the multifaceted , fruitful and useful activities of the IAEA , a unique international organization that brings together the efforts of Member States to ensure the effective and safe use of the achievements of nuclear science and technology for the good of humankind in the spirit of the lofty United Nations principles of humanism .

The feelings of my delegation and of my Government are divided between profound compassion for the families of those killed and for the French Government and indescribable outrage at this act , a most heinous , most barbaric , most cowardly , most unsoldier-like and most politically senseless act : the assassination of an unsuspecting person from a safe distance and under cover .  
It also demanded the immediate withdrawal of Bosnian Serb paramilitary units from areas surrounding that town and the cessation of armed attacks against it , requested the Secretary-General to take steps to increase the presence of UNPROFOR in Srebrenica and to arrange for the safe transfer of the ill and wounded , and decided to send a mission of Council members to ascertain , first hand , the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
The Council declared that Sarajevo and other such threatened areas , in particular the towns of Tuzla , Zepa , Gorazde , Bihac , as well as Srebrenica , should be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned and should be free of armed attacks and from any other hostile act .  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Following the perverse logic of ethnic cleansing , ethnic Serbs were often evacuated prior to an attack against civilian targets in ethnically mixed regions so that Serb forces could conduct indiscriminate shelling and wholesale random killings , safe in the knowledge that among the victimized population there were no ethnic Serbs .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
The Indonesian delegation has consistently expressed its strong condemnation of the shelling of safe areas and population centres , the sniping at civilians , the obstruction of humanitarian relief efforts and the perpetration of ethnic cleansing involving , inter alia , the relocation of populations by force , summary executions and the destruction of homes , cultural institutions and places of worship by the Bosnian Serbs .  
During the Conference , deep concern was voiced over the recent brutal attacks carried out by Bosnian Serbs against United Nations-declared safe areas , special emphasis being given to the massacre of civilians and the continued policy of ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the civilian population . 
It is for this reason that I have decided to appoint a resident deputy to my Special Envoy who will assist him in the efforts to find and implement a comprehensive settlement , based on three essential elements : the safe and early return of the refugees and internally displaced persons , maintenance of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and a special status for Abkhazia .  
Oman , like the rest of the international community , accepts neither this new escalation of fighting by attacking United Nations peace-keepers nor the status quo prevailing in those safe areas which recently became subject to the policy of ethnic cleansing .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
minimize pollution , waste , discards , catch by lost or abandoned gear , catch of non-target species , both fish and non-fish species , ( hereinafter referred to as non-target species ) and impacts on associated or dependent species , in particular endangered species , through measures including , to the extent practicable , the development and use of selective , environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques ;  
This measure was adopted in view of the exceptional circumstances and at the request of Romania , supported by other Danube riparian States , the Danube Commission and the European Union / Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( EU / OSCE ) Sanctions Coordinator , who stressed the importance for safe international navigation on the Danube of the Iron Gates I system being properly maintained and repaired in a timely manner . 
Enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence .

Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice , as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility which are not against the law , and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant .  
Women , who represent half of all adults newly infected with HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases , have emphasized that social vulnerability and the unequal power relationships between women and men are obstacles to safe sex , in their efforts to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , and sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
It would be safe to state that , so far , the Convention has not only failed to serve the noble cause of eliminating the abhorrent practice of racial discrimination , but has had the exact opposite effect by contributing to the dilution of the concept , by confusing racial discrimination with other forms of discrimination . "

However , for real progress to be achieved , my Special Envoy believes that both sides must show concrete signs that they are willing and able to reach and implement a comprehensive settlement , based on three essential elements - the safe and early return of the refugees and internally displaced persons , maintenance of the territorial integrity of Georgia and a special status for Abkhazia .  
The objectives of the social , economic and technical strategies addressing the conditions of women in poor rural and marginal urban areas were to provide an immediate remedy for their survival needs , help them find economic options that improve their conditions , and propose strategies to achieve sustainable food security , safe energy sources , clean water , sanitation , and secure income to alleviate extreme poverty .

flow of men and mat �� iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
The violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Croatian forces which were mentioned in the Secretary-General 's report on the situation in the occupied territories of Croatia ( A / 50 / 648 ) were a cause of deep concern , and Canada called upon the Croatian Government to prosecute those responsible , to do everything in its power to protect fundamental human freedoms in the territories under its control , and to permit the safe return of refugees and displaced persons .

The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
We recognize that access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services is essential to a person 's physical , psychological , social and economic well-being and should be a fundamental part of our urgent actions for the more than 1-billion people without decent living conditions .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .

These policy options will endeavour to link land and water management issues ; water for food security ; and safe drinking water supply , sanitation and sewerage and human health in the context of economic and social development .  NULLThe report will be supplemented by commissioned studies on the economic aspects of sustainable water resources development and use and gender issues , as well as a study on the relationship between water resources and growing urbanization and a study on cooperative approaches to the development of shared river basins .  
Major areas for policy , programme and project intervention will include nutrition ; the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity ; comprehensive reproductive health , including fertility regulation and sexual health , maternal health and safe motherhood , sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS ; violence against women and girls as a public health issue ; female genital mutilation ; occupational health ; and increasing the use of gender-based indicators and of national legislation to promote women 's health .  
Seek to identify strategies for the safe , effective and affordable peaceful use of nuclear material no longer required for defence purposes or for its safe permanent disposal ;

Promoting cooperation among government agencies , health-care workers , non-governmental organizations , women 's organizations and other institutions of civil society in order to develop a comprehensive national strategy for improving reproductive health care and child health-care services and ensuring that people living in poverty have full access to those services , including , inter alia , education and services on family planning , safe motherhood and prenatal and postnatal care , and the benefits of breast-feeding , consistent with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development ;  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
Often linked to other criminal activities such as the illegal arms trade , drug trafficking and money laundering , terrorism knew no boundaries , and no one State was safe against it ; effective and concerted international cooperation was therefore essential . 
The presence of newly planted mines along some secondary roads which were previously considered safe is raising serious concerns among humanitarian agencies responsible for the distribution of agricultural assistance .  
However , it is still the case that the means placed in man 's hands by science and technology , which now enable him to affect , even indirectly , the physical integrity , freedom or privacy of the individual , constitute a serious threat to human rights in any country , especially since scientific and technological progress has achieved such a degree of sophistication that individuals hardly have any truly " private " life any more and are no longer safe from genetic manipulation .  
Postponed : ( i ) inventory of existing railway line standards and parameters ; ( ii ) inventory of existing combined transport standards and parameters ; ( iii ) inventory of existing road standards and parameters ; ( iv ) compendium on safe storage of cargo in containers ; ( vii ) European Code of Inland Waterways ; ( ix ) standardized vocabulary for inland navigation ; ( xi ) environmental performance of road vehicles ; and ( xv ) glossary for transport statistics ) ;  
The Parties consider that the delimitation of the Caspian Sea between the littoral States in one form or another is fully consistent with international practice and the principles and rules of international law and will facilitate their cooperation on the basis of equal rights and mutual advantage and help to attract investments and modern technology for the purpose of the effective , rational and safe use of the natural resources of the Caspian .  
At their fourth meeting , they also expressed their concern regarding the safe and secure transportation of INF materials through the region . 187 They called on all States to maintain cooperation and exchange information on the transportation of nuclear material and radioactive waste and to continue working through IMO and IAEA in the development of additional measures which would complement the 1993 INF Code .  
Strongly urges Member States , on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the OAU , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary , orderly and secure repatriation of refugees ;

The Security Council in resolution 1078 ( 1996 ) urged Member States on an urgent and temporary basis and in cooperation with the Secretary-General and with the Organization of African Unity , to prepare the necessary arrangements , in consultation with the States concerned , to allow the immediate return of humanitarian organizations and the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to displaced persons , refugees and civilians at risk in eastern Zaire , and to help to create the necessary conditions for the voluntary orderly and secure repatriation of refugees .  
My delegation highly appreciates the valiant and expeditious efforts of the Canadian Government in taking the lead and ensuring broad participation by the international community in the formation of a temporary multinational force to facilitate the effective delivery of humanitarian aid and the voluntary , orderly and safe repatriation of refugees .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
The programmes contained in the appeal are aimed at establishing nationwide mechanisms that respond to immediate needs , such as basic relief , mine clearance and repatriation , and other mechanisms that respond to priority needs in deprived areas in the different regions , such as the provision of safe drinking water , primary health care , urban and rural recovery .  
UNMIBH was established pursuant to annex 11 of the Peace Agreement to assist the parties in their obligations of providing a safe and secure environment for all persons in their respective jurisdictions , by maintaining civilian law enforcement agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards and with respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
Implementing measures for the safe and appropriate return of the refugees , their active involvement in the social , political and economic life of the country and the provision of assistance in reconstruction of the housing and industrial and agricultural facilities destroyed by the war ;  
Considering the increasing environmental cost to society of wastes from burnt fossil fuels and the risk of global warming , we believe in safe and peaceful nuclear energy as a cost-effective and clean source of energy for the future .  
Specifically , this has included activities such as moving people to safe havens and providing assistance upon their arrival , arranging for medical treatment abroad for those wounded and unable to obtain it in situ , and facilitating third-country resettlement on either a temporary or permanent basis .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky due to the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State _ chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
Other practices are the use of indigenous objects like the buho or bamboo in cutting the umbilical cord of a newborn baby instead of unnatural objects , like scissors , the use of which , it is believed , will influence the child to be disloyal to the family and the hanging of dried umbilical cord pusod of a newborn baby beneath the doorway or window in the belief that this will keep the infant safe from accident or harm .  
The promotion and maintenance of the child 's health through strengthened safe motherhood ; breastfeeding , and improved weaning ; universal immunization ; control of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections ; and other existing public health programmes . 
By means of resolution 1101 ( 1997 ) , adopted on 28 March , the Council authorized a number of Member States to establish a multinational protection force of a temporary and limited nature to facilitate the safe and prompt delivery of humanitarian assistance and to help create a secure environment for the missions of international organizations in Albania , including those providing humanitarian assistance .  
Eleven countries , under the leadership of Italy , declared their readiness to send a total of up to 7,200 troops to form a multinational protection force with the mission of facilitating the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and of helping create the secure environment needed for the missions of international organizations in Albania , to provide humanitarian assistance and to help in monitoring elections .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
The International Atomic Energy Agency is continuing its activities and studies in such key areas as : creation of an international nuclear information system ; problems of migration of radionuclide contaminants in soils , forests and lakes ; training for the safe operation and management of nuclear power plants ; radiation monitoring and protection and radioactive waste management ; and reduction of internal radiation doses to the population .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
The proportion of endemic villages having access to safe water was still quite low , however , and only half of the villages possessed water filters in good condition , the treatment of surface water did not include all endemic areas , the supervision of community-level agents was inadequate and the information to lower levels insufficient .  
Also urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
As the peace implementation process in Bosnia and Herzegovina enters its most critical stage , it is imperative that the relatively safe and secure environment created by the presence of the multinational force be maintained and further consolidated to ensure that all the efforts and resources invested so far will bear the desired results .  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live , and that children are particularly vulnerable when deprived of an adequate standard of living in that respect ,  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Peace , security and disarmament are vital to a safe and secure planet , and the countless individuals who live daily in constant fear whether because of terrorists , hatred between ethnic groups , internecine warfare or religious persecution gives us much concern . 
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .

The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Our overriding and ultimate concern is to ensure a clean and safe planet that is hospitable and friendly to human life , now and in the future .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .

The Croatian Government is now proceeding with a laborious , costly , delicate and time-consuming campaign to return to their pre-conflict homes the mostly non-Serb victims of ethnic cleansing and the mostly Serb persons who were displaced or became refugees because of their affiliation with the occupying authorities .  The returns are carefully managed , keeping in mind international conventions which state that they should be voluntary , safe and dignified .  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
The assembled leaders renewed their commitment to ensure that all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life .  
Established in June 1987 at Dublin , Ireland , under the initial name of the World LPG Forum , with the objective to promote worldwide the use of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) as a safe , convenient , clean and efficient fuel . 
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;

The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
The reports of the experts are equally ominous .  A lack of safe drinking water for more than one third of the world 's population , continuing soil degradation , increasing global warming , unchecked urbanization , influxes of refugees , population growth and a failure to protect the fragile mountain ecosystem are some of the threatening signs .  
My country also highlighted the great importance of fostering sustainable development , whose objective is to harmonize human activities and nature by means of policies and actions that will achieve an efficient and fair economy , a just society and the preservation of the environment , in order to ensure a better quality of life for present and future generations in a safe environment .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation protecting girls from all forms of violence , including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection , female genital mutilation , rape , domestic violence , incest , sexual abuse , sexual exploitation , child prostitution and child pornography , and to develop age-appropriate safe and confidential programmes and medical , social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence ;  
Urges all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , so as to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting children ;  
When the General Assembly had adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 , the Governments of the region had felt confident that they would take concrete measures to reduce high infant and maternal mortality rates and severe malnutrition and to provide universal access to basic education , health and safe drinking water .  That had not happened , however , and most Governments , particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa , had fallen far short of the goals set for the year 2000 .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
Mr . Erds ( Hungary ) said that Hungary firmly believed that , for the scourge of terrorism to be successfully suppressed , there must be no safe havens for terrorists , and that objective could only be achieved through the establishment of a global system based on a unified international approach and effective regional cooperation .  
Achieving food security by ensuring a safe and nutritionally adequate food supply , at both the national and international levels , a reasonable degree of stability in the supply of food , as well as physical , social and economic access to enough food for all , while reaffirming that food should not be used as a tool for political pressure ;  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
In this context , the OIC Contact Group lends full support to the Secretary-General for his initiatives and diplomatic efforts in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons under international protection throughout Kosova . * Reissued for technical reasons .  
Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food , consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities ;  
The Security Council must endorse the proposals which , among other things , would pave the way for a verifiable end to violence and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo , the withdrawal of Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces , the establishment of an interim administration in the province , the safe and free return of refugees and a political settlement providing self-government for Kosovo .  
The OIC Contact Group lends its full support to all diplomatic efforts and initiatives in search of a just and durable political solution which would ensure , inter alia , an end to the Yugoslav policy of ethnic cleansing and the swift , safe and unimpeded return of all Kosovar refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes under international protection .  
The Council informed Mr . Rugova of its current efforts to solve the Kosovo crisis through a political settlement that would provide for the safe return of all refugees and for substantial self-government for Kosovo within the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and help abate the overheated nationalist sentiments now prevailing in the area .  
The serious intent of the Indonesian Government to fulfil its commitment is also evidenced by the establishment of a special task force at the ministerial level on 11 May 1999 , to monitor and ensure the safe and peaceful implementation of the popular consultation to be held under United Nations auspices .  
At present , it is safe to say that the use of judicial mechanisms may be risky because of the problem of different interpretive tools , the subjective and highly political nature of these State-chartered forums , and continuing cultural biases demonstrated by Governments .  
We have to come to grips with some very urgent questions , including the guarantee for the safe and unimpeded return of all refugees and displaced persons who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and villages in the wake of the heinous policy of ethnic cleansing that has been carried out by the Yugoslav military , police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo at the behest of the leadership in Belgrade .

As of January 1997 , under the technical cooperation project entitled Legislative Assistance for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy , IAEA has been supporting countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States in their national efforts to establish , develop or review the national laws governing the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to adopt implementing legislation for the international instruments to which they have adhered .  
Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
Resources should be allocated to basic priority human concerns , for example , moving away from military towards social spending and shifting the focus to better education , health services and safe water accessible to people living with poverty .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,

For the first time , Governments agreed that family planning , reproductive and sexual health , safe motherhood , healthy newborns , support and guidance for youth and empowerment of women were closely linked to the provision of adequate food , water , education , sanitation , shelter and other primary health services . 
The activities of the Agency in that area have been strengthened by the adoption of additional standards for the safe management and transportation of radioactive waste and for the security of nuclear power stations , which were approved by the Board of Governors , as well as by the adoption of resolutions in the General Conference on the radiological protection of patients , the safety of transport of radioactive materials and the security of radiation sources .  
Without denying the importance of developing renewable power sources , we should admit that at present the only realistic industrial-scale solution to this problem is to intensify efforts to develop a safe , environmentally acceptable and economically attractive nuclear power sector.Will the nuclear power industry be equal to a task of this magnitude ?
