Squyres , chief scientist of the Mars Rover Program , provided an explanation that he believed might be the most plausible for the above discovery : " Water percolated through the subsurface and dissolved out minerals .  As water evaporated near the surface , it left concentrated salts behind . "  
Article 20 Conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water that cut across provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal boundaries shall be delimited through consultation among the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned .  
In delimiting other conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water , the city and county people 's governments concerned shall consult with one another and then propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .  
Those who violate the provision in Article 23 , Section 2 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by discharging pollutants in excess of the pollutant discharge standards set by the state or the locality in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by a people 's government at or above the county level to make improvement within a time limit and be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan ;  
Those who violate the provisions in Article 23 , Section 3 of these Detailed Rules and Regulations by setting up a wharf for loading and unloading garbage , oils , and other toxic and harmful matter in Class Two conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water shall be ordered by the environmental protection department of a people 's government at or above the county level to demolish the wharf within a time limit and shall be liable to a fine below 100,000 yuan .  
Based on the needs of modern naval warfare that involves surface , underwater , aerial and electromagnetic offense and defense , the ships created life-like battle situations , such as being attacked and damaged by enemy planes and precision guided missiles and launching counterattacks against enemy submarines while navigating in heavy seas at night .  
During the " yichi . focal lens 99 " exercise , the US troops used its most advanced simulation system and automated command system .  For instance , it used for the first time the simulated environmental technology for airforce reconnaissance and monitoring and the most advanced long-range air to surface monitoring system installed in E-8C airborne early warning aircraft to provide target data to the exercising troops , thus greatly improving the simulation effects of a computerized battlefield .  
During the continuous cooperation of an electronic warfare exercise , the naval , air , and marine troops staged coordinated exercises and training on dozens of scenarios , including such naval training scenarios as firing at surface targets , launching anti-submarine rockets , launching air defense missiles , and launching an underwater anti-submarine operation , a surface interception operation , a surface search operation , a surface rescue operation , or a surface fire support operation , and so on ; 
During integrated barrier-breaking drills on shores and beachheads , with the support of sea and aerial long-range striking firepower and with fire cover provided by new-type ship-borne air-defense missiles and anti-tank missiles , underwater and surface demolition teams serving ship-carried rocket vehicles , motor boats , high speed boats , and armored transport vehicles successively broke barriers by various means .  
Along with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the development of the socialist market economy , and along with the increase in economic and social contradictions and the increase in different ideological and conceptual problems , corruptive ideas and culture can take advantage and build up .  In addition , the remains of feudal ideas , including feudal superstition and ignorant ideas and concepts that have long been in our society , can arise - - as the popular Chinese saying goes , " dregs float to the surface " .  
In the course of the operations , he discovered that some commanding officers were unable to take advantage of the terrain and surface features , but instead fought recklessly , causing huge casualties to their units .  Therefore , he resolutely assisted the direction of the units , breaking through the enemy positions with accurate tactical maneuvers .  
Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .  
As the aircraft had flown at a low altitude for a long time , the temperature had risen to as high as 50 degrees centigrade inside the cabin , where the crew had become rather tired , sweating all over .  Nevertheless , they were still tightly bending over the portholes , carefully looking at each and every object floating on the sea surface and waiting for a miracle to happen .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Second , the environment , air , surface and water quality in municipalities directly under the Central Government , provincial capitals , special economic zones and major tourist cities along the coast must meet relevant criteria specified by the state according to the function of the individual zone .  
In history , some people called the geographical linkage between Asia and Europe a " continental bridge . "  Today , the Asian and European foreign ministers ' meeting is also building an invisible " bridge . "  It is hoped that this " bridge " will be built with a firmer and stronger foundation and a broader surface , thus becoming a new model of friendly coexistence and common development among all peoples of the two continents .  
Since its independence , India has already established an intelligence organization which is fully equipped and functional .  On the surface , it does not seem to be as famous as the CIA of the United States , KGB of the Soviet Union , MI5 of Britain , and Mossad of Israel but just as confidential as the intelligence work should be , Indian is quietly and secretly doing its intelligence work and achieving real results which are not necessarily a bit less outstanding than others .  
The southern Fujian fishing ground is among the Chinese fishing grounds abundant in aquatic products .  It is adjacent to the Zhoushan fishing grounds , the eastern Guangdong fishing grounds , and Taiwan 's shallow water fishing grounds and has an actual operational fishing ground as large as 26,000 sq . km . in area and shoals and surface as large as more than 200 sq . km .  
They are unwilling to delve into reality , to get down and mix with the masses , and to conduct difficult and detailed investigative research .  Even if they do try this , it is just a gourd dropping into a well : it seems to sink , but then it just floats on the surface .  These organizations report good news , but not anything that might be worrying , or they report a lot of good news and little that is bad .  
Having made strenuous efforts to develop itself , China 's ocean-going space survey sector has finally acquired the world 's most advanced ocean-going survey and control technology , bringing about five tremendous leaps forward in this field , namely , from ground to sea , from surface to underwater , from inside the country to outside the country , from survey to survey and control , and from satellite to spaceship .  
Covered by the forceful firepower of guided missiles , rockets , and cruise missiles fired by surface vessels , attack planes , and bombers , the dual-purpose amphibian tanks , dual-purpose armored cars , assault vessels , and hovercrafts of the " Red Army " Marines boldly rushed onto the beachhead position guarded by the " Blue Army . " The Marines transported by vessel-carried helicopters of the " Red Army " also conducted helicopter landing on the " Blue Army 's " rear .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
The goal of the project is to develop new spare parts which can be inserted into a light wave vibrator ; to develop some eight new light beams , such as the surface physical beam , the diffracted and scattering X-ray beam , the atomic molecular physical beam , and so on ; and to build some eight corresponding laboratories on the basis of guaranteeing the accelerator 's long-term , reliable , and steady operation and enhancing integral flow intensity , brightness , and position stability of synchrotron radiation light sources by a large margin .

On 20 May 2000 , the new Taiwan leader delivered a so-called " inaugural speech , " entitled : " Taiwan Stands Up : Toward the Dawn of a Rising Era . " The speech seemed relatively mild on the surface .  In reality , it was tough behind its softness and there were hidden needles inside the soft cotton .  
Such circumstances have already emerged in some localities .  Take the northern region which has relied upon drilling water to irrigate cultivated land for a long time as an example : Owing to the excessive pumping of underground water , the underground water level in this region has fallen rapidly , causing strata to subside in varying degrees .  In north China and other regions , the excessive extraction of underground water has led to underground funnels and surface subsidence and has entailed rather serious consequences .  
The " headlong mass action " has laid emphasis on the surface form but neglected the realistic work , giving rise to the " tofukasu project . "  This brings nothing but harm to the ongoing ecological construction .  
The ore bed is made up of three to four strata of main ore body .  The exposed width of the strata combined is about 800 meters on average and the grade of the titanic schorl is between 2% and 4.1% .  Calculated on the basis of a 50-meter depth from the earth 's surface , the reserves of the titanic schorl deposit within this area amount to more than 50 million metric tons , equivalent to the size of 500 large titanic schorl beds .  
The quality of the environment of surface water of various municipalities , provincial capitals , cities of special economic zones , coastal cities and key tourist cities must meet the state standards .  
Apart from the key components of upper air sounding , weather radars , wind profilers and oceanographic observations , an automatic weather station network located in the Pearl River Delta area ( see attached diagram ) will also be mobilized to collect the necessary surface data .  
( a ) before the commencement of SSDS , whether it had evaluated if SSDS would cause soil settlement ; if it had , of the estimated average monthly settlement in the districts concerned , and the impact of SSDS on buildings and public utilities such as underground mains and road surface ; and of the related remedial measures formulated ;  
( c ) The accident analysis by the Labour Department shows that the most common causes of occupational accidents in the catering industry are ( i ) contact with hot surface or substance , ( ii ) injured by hand tool , ( iii ) striking against fixed or stationary object , ( iv ) injured whilst lifting or carrying , and ( v ) slip , trip or fall on same level .  
Regarding the six-month trial scheme for electric light buses launched by the Administration in June last year , I have learnt that the company providing these electric light buses has encountered considerable difficulties in setting up power charging facilities for electric light buses , which include the long time required for various government departments to vet the relevant applications , and the potential sites being often found to be unsuitable for setting up power charging facilities due to the presence of other underground facilities which are found only after the road surface has been dug open . 
Mr Tsang cautioned that any minor cracking , spalling or bulging of cement rendering ; damage to the concrete wall surface , wall tiles or other finishes on external parts of buildings should be repaired promptly to prevent the defective and loose parts from falling onto the streets .  
The spokesman cautioned that any minor cracking , damage or spalling or bulging of cement rendering , concrete surface , loose plasters , wall and delaminated mosaic tiles or other finishes on external and internal walls should be removed or repaired promptly to prevent the defective and loose parts from falling onto the streets .

* Purchase " lap mei " with dry outer surface , naturally pinkish colour , and when cut across , they should look firm and shiny .  
Volcanic rock erupted as ash and lava flows from now extinct volcanoes ; granite hardened deep beneath the earth 's surface from molten rock ; and sedimentary rock originally accumulated in ancient seas , lakes and river deltas .  
( c ) The current lighting requirement for swimming pools for recreational use were drawn up having regard to guidelines recommended by an international professional body , i.e . , average illumination of not less than 200 lux measured horizontally at the pool water surface .  
This was due largely to the development of an El Nino in the year , which was characterised by above normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific . The associated change in atmospheric steering flow caused tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific to turn towards the north before entering the South China Sea . 
" In Spite of Wishing and Wanting " explores the state just before falling asleep when unexpected desires surface .  The all-male cast projects barely controllable emotions : man in direct confrontation with his extreme instincts .  Poetic and passionate , it is a powerful mix of movement , music , symbols , words and silence , culminating in an unforgettable closing sequence .  
They included electronic commerce using the Internet , secure Internet communications over a wireless network , development and application of biosensor technologies , transport logistics , advanced surface coating technologies , industrial applications of micro-electro-mechanical systems , innovative product development of textiles , clothing and footwear industry , applied genomics ; and nanotechnology .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Looking at the cloisonne duck , we see a smooth and curved but , none theless , strong and powerful neck , supporting a rather small and frail head . The surface of the duck is smooth , the roughness and sharp angles of the original lump of bronze eliminated . The beauty of this piece of cloisonne is further seen by the many different " layers " of ruffled feathers , contributing to the life-like image .  
Li uses special machinery to replace human labor , creating slabs of so fine a texture that the grain of the slick wooden mold used for shaping is clearly visible on the surface of the product . As production increased , Li opened a number of " cultural service centers " in smaller towns to offer his products at close-to-cost prices . He also opened a gallery where calligraphers and painters may exhibit their works free of charge .  
But its rich color , smooth surface and pure appearance have given it a special value , and the highest quality coral is in fact more precious than gold .  
The usual shape of a seal is oblong , but some seals are unusual in form . The most important variant shapes are introduced below : Stringed seal . This seal is also known as the two surface stringed seal . This is cut in a square shape with carvings on the top and bottom and a hole in the middle to make it easy to carry .  
The Chinese , who have long emphasized careful cutting techniques and the attractive combining of colors in their cuisine , have applied these same skills in tart making . Another important consideration is freshness . Many chefs add a layer of cake or chocolate to the surface of their tart shells to prevent them from becoming soggy .  
" Their hooves are split to cling tightly to the rock surface , are hard and strong to support stress and are covered with a soft elastic cuticle that reduces friction and prevents them from slipping , " explains Professor Lu Kuangyang of National Taiwan Normal University .  
When young people dance they obtain satisfaction on the surface ; but the concealed subconscious motive may be a rebellious heart , " says Huang Wei-hsien , professor of Sociology at National Cheng-chi University . " The value judgments derived from the ideal of scholastic advancement cause those students with less than outstanding academic records to look elsewhere for support , rebelling against the superiority of society at large .  
Since September 1984 , when the joint declaration was announced , the ships have continued to ply the harbor as busily as before ; the young people and Westerners continue to crowd the shopping district , with its windows full of tempting goods from around the world ; and the sound of mahjong continues to rise and fall from the upstairs tearooms . . . on the surface , nothing seems to have changed .  
Perhaps you 've experienced these conditions : Your teeth are sensitive to eating cold , hot , or sweet foods . You experience swelling at the base of your gums or experience minor pain when chewing . The surface of your teeth becomes darkened with black or brown spots . Perhaps you experience continual pain in your mouth or nasal passage .  
On the surface , this second plenum is a routine meeting . However , given the rapidly changing domestic and international situation , the changes in ranking personnel in party and government , and the approaching challenge of the year-end elections , as well as the sudden bursting forth of the democracy movement in mainland China , the convening of the plenum has its timeliness and significance . "  
Innate rebelliousness combined with his father 's authoritarianism formed a character that is hard to fathom - - plain and taciturn on the surface , but complex and changeable inside , with more than a dash of the unexpected .  
The lake , which covered 13 acres , was dug out completely by human labor , one stroke at a time . Besides the five pavilions , the lake was surrounded by carved stones and Canadian pines , whose dense needles , twisted roots and gnarled branches were reflected in the tranquil surface of the lake .  
Film critic and dramatist Huang Chien-yeh lauds Stan Lai as an intelligent , expert creator with a strong sense of the social pulse who is a master at handling transitions , at propelling the action forward and at providing an abundance of content in a tightly knit structure . However , he only touches on the surface and reins himself in , stopping at a cheerful and upbeat level before delving into deeper concerns .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
The secluded pond is as flat as a mirror , and only rarely does a gust of cool wind passing through the woods wrinkle the white clouds and blue sky of the northern Taiwan summer day reflected on its surface .  
Some yellow and black dragonflies chase each other along the green banks . Several tiny demoiselles rest and alight among the yellow flowers of Nuphar shimadai . Occasionally , a beautiful and brightly colored Precis lightly skims over the water 's surface across to the opposite bank .  
As they entered the farm , Chang Chih-man led his bride-to-be to the front of a grave . The tombstone could not be considered grandiose and was made of gray stone slabs and concrete . Carved on its surface was the inscription , " Tomb of the misfortunate father and sons Chang Chi-lang , Tsung-jen and Kuo-jen who unjustly met their deaths on the night of 4 April , 1947 . " The parallel verses to each side read : " Two sons as companions ; Patriotic fervor floods the plains beyond the town . "  
An irreplaceable part of modern living : CFCs have many advantages . They are non-toxic , odorless , cheap , stable , non-combustible , and non-corrosive . They are also easy to put to use , and do not leave polluting residues on the surface environment .  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
She would frequently paint beyond the borders of the picture frames or add wooden blocks to the flat surface . When her colors went freely flying in " No Going , No Coming , " which was made out of transparent pieces of acrylic , her thoughts already had no way of completely expressing themselves on a canvas . Then in her powerful work " People / positioning , " she explored the Eastern conception of the mutual interaction between people , objects , time and space .  
UP into very recently , some dozen neighboring households had all been drinking the water from the pond , but when construction began on the Sun City course four years ago , run-off from the golf course polluted their water . Turned yellow and murky , the pond surface no longer reflects the sky and clouds , and the fish that the Los had raised here for generations have gone belly up .  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
In the past decade or so , Lin Tsung-sheng has been to a primeval mountain forest that even the Yangmingshan National Park Headquarters has yet to check out . He has followed upstream more than 140 major and tributary waterways in the Tatun mountain area and discovered that " the national park that gets five million visitors a year is really just the surface . " Tatun has many startling secrets hidden under its dense bamboo tree cover . "  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
When the sampans brought chest after chest of tea wrapped in bamboo strips and oiled paper and lined with lead , the stevedores expertly packed them tightly into the hold , starting with the cheapest teas at the bottom . As they built up layer upon layer , they used different sized chests and stone dunnage to pack the tea chests together seamlessly , then used wooden mallets to tap the surface of each layer down as flush as a ship 's deck .  
Or perhaps , with his keen memory , was a recollection floating to the surface of his mind , of a battlefield deep in the tropical virgin forest , permeated by gunsmoke , stray bullets flying in all directions ? China soldiers goodbyeAt first Linwang had a Burmese name which meant " King of the Jungle . "  
It 's a long read homeThe weather tended to be hot and dry , and the road went from being asphalt or grass to an uneven stone surface , strewn with pot-holes . As they rushed their journey both day and night , the elephants ' feet quickly blistered and tore , even becoming infected and festering .  
The definition of porcelain is still a matter of some dispute , but in China the usual distinguishing criteria are that porcelain is fired from china clay at high temperatures over 1200 ( earthenware is fired at around 700-800 , or sometimes up to 1000 ) ; its surface is vitrified by the high kiln temperature ( earthenware may be unglazed or sealed by a low-temperature glaze ) ; and its body is pure white in color , is translucent , has low porosity , and rings brightly when tapped .  
Where Hong Kong and Taiwan dealers differ is that Taiwan sellers are usually addicts themselves , and they get into the trade to keep up their habits . In Hong Kong , however , dealers are professionals . After being accepted by the drug organizations , they are prohibited from taking drugs and are given " training . " They are required to be well-dressed and gentlemanly , at least on the surface , and they are made familiar with police detection techniques and procedures ; they are extremely alert and cautious .  
Whenever there was a construction site , a few bizarre pieces of stone , some large , some small , would appear on the surface of the ground . Some of them were still recognizable in shape ; it was obvious that they were knives , axes , arrowheads or other crafted objects that people had used at one time . Huge stone slabs made local residents suspect that they were the lids of coffins for some people of long ago .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
In keeping with this principle , any enclosed space can be made into a " pinhole camera " by piercing a small hole in it . Rays of light passing through the pinhole cause a vertically and laterally inverted real image of the object in view to fall onto the surface opposite it , as illustrated in the diagram above .  
On that day countless swans were on the lake in their orderly lines , stretching their necks under the surface in the shallow waters to gulp down the algae . Floating on the surface of the water , each plump swan formed a round white spot .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
But a month later , when the planting , harvesting and sale of quick-growing vegetables had resumed down in the plains , there were still many places on the Northern Cross-Island Highway where the road bed was continuing to collapse and the surface still being washed away , and rocks were still falling down the mountainsides . As for various farming access roads which were never graded or built on proper foundations in the first place , whenever it rains many of them simply " disappear . "  
Upon entering the clean room , you see large machines in a row : The " ion implant machine " lays a membrane on the chip . Then , in a process called photolithography , the circuit design is projected onto the surface using glass " photomasks . " Then the chip goes into the " etch " process , where areas of excess metal ( i.e . metal which is outside the design projected on to the chip ) are chemically eroded away . What is left is are rows of oblong dies .  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
ROC naval planning assumes that the PRC is the most likely enemy . Considering Taiwan 's defensive strategy and the limits on the tolerable defense budget burden , the ROC is aiming for a force that will be " small in numbers but high in quality . " The maritime component of such a force must be able to deal with threats from the air or from the surface or sub-surface of the ocean ; it is also responsible for maintaining a credible amphibious capability .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Order is occasionally disturbed when an osprey-which features in China 's most ancient poetry-having finished eating a fish it caught fresh from the river , flies away against the grey background of the concrete city , startling the many ducks on the surface of the river . . . .  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
" Generally speaking , based on the production process , dZi beads ought to count as a kind of " etched agate " [ agate to which alkaline metal has been applied and heated to create a surface for etching designs ] , " Chang Hung-shih explains .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
G-Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water-soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time . G-Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .  
3,500 years ago people in Egypt and Mesopotamia had already mastered the core-forming method of glassmaking , in which molten glass was extracted from the crucible on the end of an iron bar that had first been wrapped in a mixture of clay and horse manure . Threads of colored glass were then wound around the surface and decorative wave patterns were added . Once the glass cooled the core was scooped out , leaving a flask for storing perfume or collecting teardrops .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Some paddies are full of plants rising above the water to all different heights . Others are set aside just for lotus and water lily . Bits of clouds and blue sky reflect between the plants off the broken surface of the water . Plants of every description cover the raised earthen barriers between the different paddies , their tiny maroon , yellow , and white blossoms standing out brilliantly in the sun .  
Unlike Taiwan 's many man-made lakes and ponds , which are often planted with water lily and lotus , this pond is home to the little-known Taiwan brandy bottle , a species endemic to Taiwan . Over half the surface of the water is covered with this beautiful plant 's oval leaves and yellow blossoms .  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
Every 11 years , when the solar magnetic field goes into overdrive , in some areas of the sun 's surface the temperature sinks to 4000oC , so that these areas look darker in color than the surrounding photosphere . Seen from the earth they appear as small dark spots on the face of the sun , but in fact a single sunspot may be many times larger than the total surface area of the earth .  
Combining a mild outward appearance with a man-of-action personality lurking just beneath the surface , Robert Huang is actually rather similar to the seemingly stoic but untamably adventurous Victorian Englishmen that he admires . It probably is n't fair to attribute the success of Rose House , with its emphasis on Victorian style , to simple chance .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
In the course of Taroko 's upward movement , intensive mountain-forming activity was churning up the soil underneath the surface . Sedimentary layers beneath the surface were continually pushed upward , compressed , and twisted by tectonic activity , and then were folded back under the surface . The high temperatures and pressure associated with such tectonic activity tempered the sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock .  
The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
Tsao Shuh-jong explains how the basalt got this columnar shape : " After the lava stopped flowing , the molten rock began to cool . At the top and bottom ends there were polygonal cracks caused by shrinking , which eventually penetrated through the rock to form closely-packed hexagonal vertical pillars . In areas where the surface has risen , you can sometimes see groups of basalt pillars in the shape of a fan or angled like toppled dominoes . "  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
After the gold veins of the took shape , they were raised upward as the land surface rose . Within the last million years , erosion effects have gradually exposed the gold to the surface , and gold particles from shallow veins have been washed into rivers . It was possible to run across gold in the Keelung River , which is how it was discovered in the first place .  
Occasionally , they would venture outdoors to converse , and from these sessions emerged a wealth of poetry . " Sipping zhou in the mountainside cottage / Pursuing beauty in elegant company / Today the splendid colors seem even brighter / The lake 's rippling surface shining like a maiden 's red dress . "  
Besides these there were also pinch-mouthed and wide-rimmed basins , often decorated from the neck down with various design motifs that vary greatly , although square criss-cross patterns and slanting criss-cross patterns predominate . In addition , there are a few impressed circles and dotted designs . Usually such ornamentation is found on the exterior surface and above the lips of the pots .  
His objective was to achieve a new kind of texture and break with the norms of traditional lacquered pottery . Artists before Li simply took pottery as the base for the lacquer , while Li sought to preserve the linear patterns and texture of pottery along with the " layered light " effect of lacquer right on the surface of the finished work , thereby adding to its visual impact and achieving a melding of these two millennia-old art forms and blazing a new trail in the arts .  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
It was also at this time that the family adopted corporate management methods . On display alongside the shoulder pole-with its dark , shiny surface hinting at a long history-are a number of other important historical mementos from the company 's past , including a ceiling beam , a brick , and a foundation stone quarried in northern Taipei 's Chili-an district . All these items were taken from the original building before it was torn down to be replaced by the new company headquarters building .  
Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
The outer surface of the skull of the left temple surrounding the gunshot wound of entry showed abundant soot deposits indicating that the end of the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the head at the time the shot was fired .  
Ocean thermal energy conversion ( OTEC ) , despite its high capital cost , offers specific attractions for small islands because of their typical location close to deep oceans and warm surface water .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
For long-lived , high-level waste , the Act of December 1991 established rules of research that will lead to the appropriate management of such wastes : separation and transmutation of long-lived radioactive elements ; possibilities of reversible and irreversible storage in deep geologic formations ; and laboratory research including conditioning and long-term surface depositories for such wastes .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .

The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development : ( a ) the back scatter lidar , with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology ; ( b ) the differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) , which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity , temperature and pressure ; ( c ) the Doppler lidar , with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies ; and ( d ) the ranging and altimeter lidar , which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth 's surface features .

The proportion of endemic villages having access to safe water was still quite low , however , and only half of the villages possessed water filters in good condition , the treatment of surface water did not include all endemic areas , the supervision of community-level agents was inadequate and the information to lower levels insufficient .  
While no one can yet accurately estimate the total number of items at large or which areas are contaminated , historic estimates have assumed 3-million anti-personnel landmines , and recent government estimates suggest that as much as 13,000 square kilometres ( a quarter of the land surface of Croatia ) , are being treated as suspected mined areas . 
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
The Russian cosmonauts performed five space walks , during which they succeeded in mounting a new telescopic loading boom on the external surface of the station , together with supplementary scientific instrumentation , and also transferred fresh a solar array , fitted with United States photoelectric elements , from the docking unit to the Kvant astrophysics module .

Though national and local approaches to the problem of mine clearance have existed for decades , millions of landmines and other unexploded ordnance are still buried in the soil or scattered on the surface in over 60 countries around the world , and thousands of innocent people are being killed or injured every day .  
In the light of the developing situation on the ground and particularly the resumption of hostilities in May 2000 , which necessitated the rapid reinforcement of the military component of the Mission and consequently the rapid transportation of contingent-owned equipment to the mission area , 10,635 and 2,057 metric tons of contingent-owned equipment were transported by air and surface , respectively , resulting in the unforeseen additional requirements totalling $ 22,023,000 .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Many delegations called for increased international cooperation in financial and technology assistance in building capacity , education , training and raising public awareness , particularly in systematic observations of the Earths atmosphere and of the oceans and the land surface , including satellite data .  
As stated in paragraph 13 of the attached executive summary , the peak levels of production recorded in phases VI and VIII of the programme were only achieved at the expense of long-term damage to the oil-bearing structures utilized , and with increasing collateral damage to surface facilities operating beyond recommended ( and safe ) maintenance periods .  
The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .  
The shuttle had mapped 90 per cent of the earths surface with unprecedented precision , and astronauts on board had discovered and confirmed ancient impact craters on earth , tracked deforestation , monitored coral reefs , studied air and water pollution and documented the effects of drought , floods , volcanoes and hurricanes .  
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
The task of preparing for the arrival of external drilling contractors for the almost 400 new wells planned is an enormous one , requiring numerous access roads , earth-moving and foundation works to allow access to the incoming drilling units and to construct , repair and maintain surface facilities required to treat current and future crude oil production flows before export or refining can be undertaken .  
Squyres , chief scientist of the Mars Rover Program , provided an explanation that he believed might be the most plausible for the above discovery : " Water percolated through the subsurface and dissolved out minerals .  As water evaporated near the surface , it left concentrated salts behind . "  
Article 20 Conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water that cut across provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal boundaries shall be delimited through consultation among the provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal people 's governments concerned .  
In delimiting other conservation zones for surface sources of domestic potable water , the city and county people 's governments concerned shall consult with one another and then propose a delimitation plan to be submitted to the provincial , autonomous regional , or municipal people 's government for approval .

Based on the needs of modern naval warfare that involves surface , underwater , aerial and electromagnetic offense and defense , the ships created life-like battle situations , such as being attacked and damaged by enemy planes and precision guided missiles and launching counterattacks against enemy submarines while navigating in heavy seas at night .  
During the " yichi . focal lens 99 " exercise , the US troops used its most advanced simulation system and automated command system .  For instance , it used for the first time the simulated environmental technology for airforce reconnaissance and monitoring and the most advanced long-range air to surface monitoring system installed in E-8C airborne early warning aircraft to provide target data to the exercising troops , thus greatly improving the simulation effects of a computerized battlefield .  
During the continuous cooperation of an electronic warfare exercise , the naval , air , and marine troops staged coordinated exercises and training on dozens of scenarios , including such naval training scenarios as firing at surface targets , launching anti-submarine rockets , launching air defense missiles , and launching an underwater anti-submarine operation , a surface interception operation , a surface search operation , a surface rescue operation , or a surface fire support operation , and so on ; 
During integrated barrier-breaking drills on shores and beachheads , with the support of sea and aerial long-range striking firepower and with fire cover provided by new-type ship-borne air-defense missiles and anti-tank missiles , underwater and surface demolition teams serving ship-carried rocket vehicles , motor boats , high speed boats , and armored transport vehicles successively broke barriers by various means .  
Along with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the development of the socialist market economy , and along with the increase in economic and social contradictions and the increase in different ideological and conceptual problems , corruptive ideas and culture can take advantage and build up .  In addition , the remains of feudal ideas , including feudal superstition and ignorant ideas and concepts that have long been in our society , can arise - - as the popular Chinese saying goes , " dregs float to the surface " .  
In the course of the operations , he discovered that some commanding officers were unable to take advantage of the terrain and surface features , but instead fought recklessly , causing huge casualties to their units .  Therefore , he resolutely assisted the direction of the units , breaking through the enemy positions with accurate tactical maneuvers .  
Mutual exchanges between Jinmen and Mazu on the one hand and Fujian 's coastal areas on another hand have been going on since a long time ago .  The so-called " mini three links " currently implemented by Taiwan authorities merely transformed such exchanges from " underground " to " the surface . "  Or just as what the Taiwan mass media pointed out , the measure would merely " decriminalize " the existing exchanges and does not have any realistic significance .  
As the aircraft had flown at a low altitude for a long time , the temperature had risen to as high as 50 degrees centigrade inside the cabin , where the crew had become rather tired , sweating all over .  Nevertheless , they were still tightly bending over the portholes , carefully looking at each and every object floating on the sea surface and waiting for a miracle to happen .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Second , the environment , air , surface and water quality in municipalities directly under the Central Government , provincial capitals , special economic zones and major tourist cities along the coast must meet relevant criteria specified by the state according to the function of the individual zone .  
In history , some people called the geographical linkage between Asia and Europe a " continental bridge . "  Today , the Asian and European foreign ministers ' meeting is also building an invisible " bridge . "  It is hoped that this " bridge " will be built with a firmer and stronger foundation and a broader surface , thus becoming a new model of friendly coexistence and common development among all peoples of the two continents .  
Since its independence , India has already established an intelligence organization which is fully equipped and functional .  On the surface , it does not seem to be as famous as the CIA of the United States , KGB of the Soviet Union , MI5 of Britain , and Mossad of Israel but just as confidential as the intelligence work should be , Indian is quietly and secretly doing its intelligence work and achieving real results which are not necessarily a bit less outstanding than others .  
The southern Fujian fishing ground is among the Chinese fishing grounds abundant in aquatic products .  It is adjacent to the Zhoushan fishing grounds , the eastern Guangdong fishing grounds , and Taiwan 's shallow water fishing grounds and has an actual operational fishing ground as large as 26,000 sq . km . in area and shoals and surface as large as more than 200 sq . km .  
They are unwilling to delve into reality , to get down and mix with the masses , and to conduct difficult and detailed investigative research .  Even if they do try this , it is just a gourd dropping into a well : it seems to sink , but then it just floats on the surface .  These organizations report good news , but not anything that might be worrying , or they report a lot of good news and little that is bad .  
Having made strenuous efforts to develop itself , China 's ocean-going space survey sector has finally acquired the world 's most advanced ocean-going survey and control technology , bringing about five tremendous leaps forward in this field , namely , from ground to sea , from surface to underwater , from inside the country to outside the country , from survey to survey and control , and from satellite to spaceship .  
Covered by the forceful firepower of guided missiles , rockets , and cruise missiles fired by surface vessels , attack planes , and bombers , the dual-purpose amphibian tanks , dual-purpose armored cars , assault vessels , and hovercrafts of the " Red Army " Marines boldly rushed onto the beachhead position guarded by the " Blue Army . " The Marines transported by vessel-carried helicopters of the " Red Army " also conducted helicopter landing on the " Blue Army 's " rear .  
With its great efforts over the past 50 years , the Chinese Navy has initially built a modern marine operational force composed of the crack troops of five branches - - surface warships , submarines , naval air force , coastal guard , and the marines .  The Chinese Navy is capable of carrying out various kinds of operational tasks on coastal waters .  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
The goal of the project is to develop new spare parts which can be inserted into a light wave vibrator ; to develop some eight new light beams , such as the surface physical beam , the diffracted and scattering X-ray beam , the atomic molecular physical beam , and so on ; and to build some eight corresponding laboratories on the basis of guaranteeing the accelerator 's long-term , reliable , and steady operation and enhancing integral flow intensity , brightness , and position stability of synchrotron radiation light sources by a large margin .

On 20 May 2000 , the new Taiwan leader delivered a so-called " inaugural speech , " entitled : " Taiwan Stands Up : Toward the Dawn of a Rising Era . " The speech seemed relatively mild on the surface .  In reality , it was tough behind its softness and there were hidden needles inside the soft cotton .  
Such circumstances have already emerged in some localities .  Take the northern region which has relied upon drilling water to irrigate cultivated land for a long time as an example : Owing to the excessive pumping of underground water , the underground water level in this region has fallen rapidly , causing strata to subside in varying degrees .  In north China and other regions , the excessive extraction of underground water has led to underground funnels and surface subsidence and has entailed rather serious consequences .  
The " headlong mass action " has laid emphasis on the surface form but neglected the realistic work , giving rise to the " tofukasu project . "  This brings nothing but harm to the ongoing ecological construction .  
The ore bed is made up of three to four strata of main ore body .  The exposed width of the strata combined is about 800 meters on average and the grade of the titanic schorl is between 2% and 4.1% .  Calculated on the basis of a 50-meter depth from the earth 's surface , the reserves of the titanic schorl deposit within this area amount to more than 50 million metric tons , equivalent to the size of 500 large titanic schorl beds .  
The quality of the environment of surface water of various municipalities , provincial capitals , cities of special economic zones , coastal cities and key tourist cities must meet the state standards .  
Apart from the key components of upper air sounding , weather radars , wind profilers and oceanographic observations , an automatic weather station network located in the Pearl River Delta area ( see attached diagram ) will also be mobilized to collect the necessary surface data .  
( a ) before the commencement of SSDS , whether it had evaluated if SSDS would cause soil settlement ; if it had , of the estimated average monthly settlement in the districts concerned , and the impact of SSDS on buildings and public utilities such as underground mains and road surface ; and of the related remedial measures formulated ;  
( c ) The accident analysis by the Labour Department shows that the most common causes of occupational accidents in the catering industry are ( i ) contact with hot surface or substance , ( ii ) injured by hand tool , ( iii ) striking against fixed or stationary object , ( iv ) injured whilst lifting or carrying , and ( v ) slip , trip or fall on same level .  
Regarding the six-month trial scheme for electric light buses launched by the Administration in June last year , I have learnt that the company providing these electric light buses has encountered considerable difficulties in setting up power charging facilities for electric light buses , which include the long time required for various government departments to vet the relevant applications , and the potential sites being often found to be unsuitable for setting up power charging facilities due to the presence of other underground facilities which are found only after the road surface has been dug open . 
Mr Tsang cautioned that any minor cracking , spalling or bulging of cement rendering ; damage to the concrete wall surface , wall tiles or other finishes on external parts of buildings should be repaired promptly to prevent the defective and loose parts from falling onto the streets .  
The spokesman cautioned that any minor cracking , damage or spalling or bulging of cement rendering , concrete surface , loose plasters , wall and delaminated mosaic tiles or other finishes on external and internal walls should be removed or repaired promptly to prevent the defective and loose parts from falling onto the streets .

* Purchase " lap mei " with dry outer surface , naturally pinkish colour , and when cut across , they should look firm and shiny .  
Volcanic rock erupted as ash and lava flows from now extinct volcanoes ; granite hardened deep beneath the earth 's surface from molten rock ; and sedimentary rock originally accumulated in ancient seas , lakes and river deltas .  
( c ) The current lighting requirement for swimming pools for recreational use were drawn up having regard to guidelines recommended by an international professional body , i.e . , average illumination of not less than 200 lux measured horizontally at the pool water surface .  
This was due largely to the development of an El Nino in the year , which was characterised by above normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific . The associated change in atmospheric steering flow caused tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific to turn towards the north before entering the South China Sea . 
" In Spite of Wishing and Wanting " explores the state just before falling asleep when unexpected desires surface .  The all-male cast projects barely controllable emotions : man in direct confrontation with his extreme instincts .  Poetic and passionate , it is a powerful mix of movement , music , symbols , words and silence , culminating in an unforgettable closing sequence .  
They included electronic commerce using the Internet , secure Internet communications over a wireless network , development and application of biosensor technologies , transport logistics , advanced surface coating technologies , industrial applications of micro-electro-mechanical systems , innovative product development of textiles , clothing and footwear industry , applied genomics ; and nanotechnology .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
Looking at the cloisonne duck , we see a smooth and curved but , none theless , strong and powerful neck , supporting a rather small and frail head . The surface of the duck is smooth , the roughness and sharp angles of the original lump of bronze eliminated . The beauty of this piece of cloisonne is further seen by the many different " layers " of ruffled feathers , contributing to the life-like image .  
Li uses special machinery to replace human labor , creating slabs of so fine a texture that the grain of the slick wooden mold used for shaping is clearly visible on the surface of the product . As production increased , Li opened a number of " cultural service centers " in smaller towns to offer his products at close-to-cost prices . He also opened a gallery where calligraphers and painters may exhibit their works free of charge .  
But its rich color , smooth surface and pure appearance have given it a special value , and the highest quality coral is in fact more precious than gold .  
The usual shape of a seal is oblong , but some seals are unusual in form . The most important variant shapes are introduced below : Stringed seal . This seal is also known as the two surface stringed seal . This is cut in a square shape with carvings on the top and bottom and a hole in the middle to make it easy to carry .  
The Chinese , who have long emphasized careful cutting techniques and the attractive combining of colors in their cuisine , have applied these same skills in tart making . Another important consideration is freshness . Many chefs add a layer of cake or chocolate to the surface of their tart shells to prevent them from becoming soggy .  
" Their hooves are split to cling tightly to the rock surface , are hard and strong to support stress and are covered with a soft elastic cuticle that reduces friction and prevents them from slipping , " explains Professor Lu Kuangyang of National Taiwan Normal University .  
When young people dance they obtain satisfaction on the surface ; but the concealed subconscious motive may be a rebellious heart , " says Huang Wei-hsien , professor of Sociology at National Cheng-chi University . " The value judgments derived from the ideal of scholastic advancement cause those students with less than outstanding academic records to look elsewhere for support , rebelling against the superiority of society at large .  
Since September 1984 , when the joint declaration was announced , the ships have continued to ply the harbor as busily as before ; the young people and Westerners continue to crowd the shopping district , with its windows full of tempting goods from around the world ; and the sound of mahjong continues to rise and fall from the upstairs tearooms . . . on the surface , nothing seems to have changed .  
Perhaps you 've experienced these conditions : Your teeth are sensitive to eating cold , hot , or sweet foods . You experience swelling at the base of your gums or experience minor pain when chewing . The surface of your teeth becomes darkened with black or brown spots . Perhaps you experience continual pain in your mouth or nasal passage .  
On the surface , this second plenum is a routine meeting . However , given the rapidly changing domestic and international situation , the changes in ranking personnel in party and government , and the approaching challenge of the year-end elections , as well as the sudden bursting forth of the democracy movement in mainland China , the convening of the plenum has its timeliness and significance . "  
Innate rebelliousness combined with his father 's authoritarianism formed a character that is hard to fathom - - plain and taciturn on the surface , but complex and changeable inside , with more than a dash of the unexpected .  
The lake , which covered 13 acres , was dug out completely by human labor , one stroke at a time . Besides the five pavilions , the lake was surrounded by carved stones and Canadian pines , whose dense needles , twisted roots and gnarled branches were reflected in the tranquil surface of the lake .  
Film critic and dramatist Huang Chien-yeh lauds Stan Lai as an intelligent , expert creator with a strong sense of the social pulse who is a master at handling transitions , at propelling the action forward and at providing an abundance of content in a tightly knit structure . However , he only touches on the surface and reins himself in , stopping at a cheerful and upbeat level before delving into deeper concerns .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
It 's too bad that negative population growth is n't quite so ideal as it appears on the surface , " says Chang Pei Chi , director of the Office of Man power Planning at Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan . A low birth rate leading to negative population growth will cause the population structure to be perverted into an inverse pyramid . Over time , society will quickly age and lose its vitality . Besides having streets filled with " white-haired old gentlemen , " many social problems will follow .  
The secluded pond is as flat as a mirror , and only rarely does a gust of cool wind passing through the woods wrinkle the white clouds and blue sky of the northern Taiwan summer day reflected on its surface .  
Some yellow and black dragonflies chase each other along the green banks . Several tiny demoiselles rest and alight among the yellow flowers of Nuphar shimadai . Occasionally , a beautiful and brightly colored Precis lightly skims over the water 's surface across to the opposite bank .  
As they entered the farm , Chang Chih-man led his bride-to-be to the front of a grave . The tombstone could not be considered grandiose and was made of gray stone slabs and concrete . Carved on its surface was the inscription , " Tomb of the misfortunate father and sons Chang Chi-lang , Tsung-jen and Kuo-jen who unjustly met their deaths on the night of 4 April , 1947 . " The parallel verses to each side read : " Two sons as companions ; Patriotic fervor floods the plains beyond the town . "  
An irreplaceable part of modern living : CFCs have many advantages . They are non-toxic , odorless , cheap , stable , non-combustible , and non-corrosive . They are also easy to put to use , and do not leave polluting residues on the surface environment .  
For a long time , the WCB has only built wall-type dikes which stand perpendicular to the surface . In the past the main purpose of the sea dikes was to prevent intense waves brought by bad weather from heading inland . Today the coast suffers from the effects of inland gravel extraction and ground water extraction and is continually eroding .  
Furthermore , in the spirit of " If I do n't enter hell , who will ? " he has courageously infiltrated the heart of the system . Perhaps on the surface it appears that he can gain status and honored treatment . But , on the outside , he must fend off vicious attacks from right and left , and , on the inside , must constantly be thinking about how to maintain his judgement and not become confused . This is certainly no easy process !  
She would frequently paint beyond the borders of the picture frames or add wooden blocks to the flat surface . When her colors went freely flying in " No Going , No Coming , " which was made out of transparent pieces of acrylic , her thoughts already had no way of completely expressing themselves on a canvas . Then in her powerful work " People / positioning , " she explored the Eastern conception of the mutual interaction between people , objects , time and space .  
UP into very recently , some dozen neighboring households had all been drinking the water from the pond , but when construction began on the Sun City course four years ago , run-off from the golf course polluted their water . Turned yellow and murky , the pond surface no longer reflects the sky and clouds , and the fish that the Los had raised here for generations have gone belly up .  
The explanation is very simple : the ancients gathered their knowledge completely from nature ; they inferred a direct relation between the waxing and waning of the natural world and the birth and death of every human being . When would the fish swim up to the water 's surface through the broken ice ? When would the swallows arrive ? When would the crops bloom and wither ?  
In the past decade or so , Lin Tsung-sheng has been to a primeval mountain forest that even the Yangmingshan National Park Headquarters has yet to check out . He has followed upstream more than 140 major and tributary waterways in the Tatun mountain area and discovered that " the national park that gets five million visitors a year is really just the surface . " Tatun has many startling secrets hidden under its dense bamboo tree cover . "  
TapaishaAt Green Island 's southern extremity , in the water along the coast where the depth exceeds ten meters , there are a lot of large reefs , some of which even rise above the surface of the water . From 50 to 250 meters out , you can see indications of two gigantic reefs . The reefs ' rocks have a great variety of shapes , and giant pieces of coral are spread about . If divers go into the caves , they can see many creatures seeking refuge inside .  
When the sampans brought chest after chest of tea wrapped in bamboo strips and oiled paper and lined with lead , the stevedores expertly packed them tightly into the hold , starting with the cheapest teas at the bottom . As they built up layer upon layer , they used different sized chests and stone dunnage to pack the tea chests together seamlessly , then used wooden mallets to tap the surface of each layer down as flush as a ship 's deck .  
Or perhaps , with his keen memory , was a recollection floating to the surface of his mind , of a battlefield deep in the tropical virgin forest , permeated by gunsmoke , stray bullets flying in all directions ? China soldiers goodbyeAt first Linwang had a Burmese name which meant " King of the Jungle . "  
It 's a long read homeThe weather tended to be hot and dry , and the road went from being asphalt or grass to an uneven stone surface , strewn with pot-holes . As they rushed their journey both day and night , the elephants ' feet quickly blistered and tore , even becoming infected and festering .  
The definition of porcelain is still a matter of some dispute , but in China the usual distinguishing criteria are that porcelain is fired from china clay at high temperatures over 1200 ( earthenware is fired at around 700-800 , or sometimes up to 1000 ) ; its surface is vitrified by the high kiln temperature ( earthenware may be unglazed or sealed by a low-temperature glaze ) ; and its body is pure white in color , is translucent , has low porosity , and rings brightly when tapped .  
Where Hong Kong and Taiwan dealers differ is that Taiwan sellers are usually addicts themselves , and they get into the trade to keep up their habits . In Hong Kong , however , dealers are professionals . After being accepted by the drug organizations , they are prohibited from taking drugs and are given " training . " They are required to be well-dressed and gentlemanly , at least on the surface , and they are made familiar with police detection techniques and procedures ; they are extremely alert and cautious .  
Whenever there was a construction site , a few bizarre pieces of stone , some large , some small , would appear on the surface of the ground . Some of them were still recognizable in shape ; it was obvious that they were knives , axes , arrowheads or other crafted objects that people had used at one time . Huge stone slabs made local residents suspect that they were the lids of coffins for some people of long ago .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
In keeping with this principle , any enclosed space can be made into a " pinhole camera " by piercing a small hole in it . Rays of light passing through the pinhole cause a vertically and laterally inverted real image of the object in view to fall onto the surface opposite it , as illustrated in the diagram above .  
On that day countless swans were on the lake in their orderly lines , stretching their necks under the surface in the shallow waters to gulp down the algae . Floating on the surface of the water , each plump swan formed a round white spot .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
But a month later , when the planting , harvesting and sale of quick-growing vegetables had resumed down in the plains , there were still many places on the Northern Cross-Island Highway where the road bed was continuing to collapse and the surface still being washed away , and rocks were still falling down the mountainsides . As for various farming access roads which were never graded or built on proper foundations in the first place , whenever it rains many of them simply " disappear . "  
Upon entering the clean room , you see large machines in a row : The " ion implant machine " lays a membrane on the chip . Then , in a process called photolithography , the circuit design is projected onto the surface using glass " photomasks . " Then the chip goes into the " etch " process , where areas of excess metal ( i.e . metal which is outside the design projected on to the chip ) are chemically eroded away . What is left is are rows of oblong dies .  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
Before the plants have sprouted , a net structure will be watered for five minutes ; in the second phase , for half that time , and in the last phase for only thirty seconds . " This is because the leaves are growing , and blocking the surface of the soil . The sun ca n't get in , and the soil stays wet , so it does n't need too much water . "  
The water lily , which grows from the depths to above the surface of water , seems to bring a tremendous hidden vitality out of nowhere , hinting at the true source of creation . Many ancient Egyptian myths are connected to the water lily . In Egypt , where they worshipped the sun , they have discovered designs in which the sun god Ra sits as a child on a water lily .  
ROC naval planning assumes that the PRC is the most likely enemy . Considering Taiwan 's defensive strategy and the limits on the tolerable defense budget burden , the ROC is aiming for a force that will be " small in numbers but high in quality . " The maritime component of such a force must be able to deal with threats from the air or from the surface or sub-surface of the ocean ; it is also responsible for maintaining a credible amphibious capability .  
The main weaponry for surface warfare at sea is anti-ship missiles , which are superior to traditional shipboard guns in terms of precision , range , and firepower . Currently , all of the ROC 's major warships are equipped with weapons to counter anti-ship missiles .  
Order is occasionally disturbed when an osprey-which features in China 's most ancient poetry-having finished eating a fish it caught fresh from the river , flies away against the grey background of the concrete city , startling the many ducks on the surface of the river . . . .  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
" Generally speaking , based on the production process , dZi beads ought to count as a kind of " etched agate " [ agate to which alkaline metal has been applied and heated to create a surface for etching designs ] , " Chang Hung-shih explains .  
" Her paintings amalgamate various techniques , including glue-and-color-on-silk and water-and-ink . On the surface is the coordination of realism , symbolism and surrealism , reflecting a sort of natural , balanced and fresh effect , attained after traditional art has been baptized by modern civilization , " opines art critic Huang Hsiao-shih .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
Because past surveys of Taiwan faults were mostly limited to examinations of surface geology , with no money to obtain more precise results by digging or drilling under the surface , major mistakes were common . Particularly in metropolitan areas where high real estate prices mean that all the land is covered by buildings , ruptures are impossible to see .  
G-Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water-soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface . Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time . G-Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .  
3,500 years ago people in Egypt and Mesopotamia had already mastered the core-forming method of glassmaking , in which molten glass was extracted from the crucible on the end of an iron bar that had first been wrapped in a mixture of clay and horse manure . Threads of colored glass were then wound around the surface and decorative wave patterns were added . Once the glass cooled the core was scooped out , leaving a flask for storing perfume or collecting teardrops .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Some paddies are full of plants rising above the water to all different heights . Others are set aside just for lotus and water lily . Bits of clouds and blue sky reflect between the plants off the broken surface of the water . Plants of every description cover the raised earthen barriers between the different paddies , their tiny maroon , yellow , and white blossoms standing out brilliantly in the sun .  
Unlike Taiwan 's many man-made lakes and ponds , which are often planted with water lily and lotus , this pond is home to the little-known Taiwan brandy bottle , a species endemic to Taiwan . Over half the surface of the water is covered with this beautiful plant 's oval leaves and yellow blossoms .  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
Kuanshan Township is located on eastern Taiwan 's main north-south highway . The township is ringed by a 12-kilometer bicycle trail , three to four meters wide , with a concrete surface all the way . The trail is marked off with red bricks , and every 100 meters colored bricks are set in the ground in all kinds of patterns , to remind you that you have advanced another 100 meters !  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Twenty years ago theorists proposed that the magnetic field extended down below the sun 's surface to a depth of 0.7 solar radii from the center of the sun surface , but signals from the magnetic field are very weak , and could not be detected by the methods and instruments then available . But today acoustic imaging has enabled Chou Dean-yi to find much stronger evidence in support of the 20-year-old theory , and this is highly significant for solar astronomy .  
Every 11 years , when the solar magnetic field goes into overdrive , in some areas of the sun 's surface the temperature sinks to 4000oC , so that these areas look darker in color than the surrounding photosphere . Seen from the earth they appear as small dark spots on the face of the sun , but in fact a single sunspot may be many times larger than the total surface area of the earth .  
Combining a mild outward appearance with a man-of-action personality lurking just beneath the surface , Robert Huang is actually rather similar to the seemingly stoic but untamably adventurous Victorian Englishmen that he admires . It probably is n't fair to attribute the success of Rose House , with its emphasis on Victorian style , to simple chance .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
According to statistics of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , if greenhouse gases ( mainly carbon dioxide ) continue to increase at the current rate , in 50 years the global temperature will be five degrees higher than it is now , causing the ice caps to melt faster , raising sea level , and putting one percent of the Earth 's current land surface under water . Other effects will be a sharp increase in the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves .  
After the government of the Republic of China came to Taiwan in 1949 , the island of Kinmen became the front line in the Chinese Civil War and an important military base . A huge network of tunnels was dug out underground , while , on the surface , lovely traditional villages remained totally intact .  
In the course of Taroko 's upward movement , intensive mountain-forming activity was churning up the soil underneath the surface . Sedimentary layers beneath the surface were continually pushed upward , compressed , and twisted by tectonic activity , and then were folded back under the surface . The high temperatures and pressure associated with such tectonic activity tempered the sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock .  
The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
Tsao Shuh-jong explains how the basalt got this columnar shape : " After the lava stopped flowing , the molten rock began to cool . At the top and bottom ends there were polygonal cracks caused by shrinking , which eventually penetrated through the rock to form closely-packed hexagonal vertical pillars . In areas where the surface has risen , you can sometimes see groups of basalt pillars in the shape of a fan or angled like toppled dominoes . "  
Eight million years ago , the east coast of Taiwan was at the very edge of where the Philippine Sea Plate was crashing into the Asian mainland . As compression along the edge of the Eurasian Plate increased , fracturing of the crust in the Taiwan Strait came to an end . Channels for magma to reach the surface were sealed , and volcanic activity was locked out . All that remains is the basalt that the sea has been continuing to erode for tens of millions of years .  
After the gold veins of the took shape , they were raised upward as the land surface rose . Within the last million years , erosion effects have gradually exposed the gold to the surface , and gold particles from shallow veins have been washed into rivers . It was possible to run across gold in the Keelung River , which is how it was discovered in the first place .  
Occasionally , they would venture outdoors to converse , and from these sessions emerged a wealth of poetry . " Sipping zhou in the mountainside cottage / Pursuing beauty in elegant company / Today the splendid colors seem even brighter / The lake 's rippling surface shining like a maiden 's red dress . "  
Besides these there were also pinch-mouthed and wide-rimmed basins , often decorated from the neck down with various design motifs that vary greatly , although square criss-cross patterns and slanting criss-cross patterns predominate . In addition , there are a few impressed circles and dotted designs . Usually such ornamentation is found on the exterior surface and above the lips of the pots .  
His objective was to achieve a new kind of texture and break with the norms of traditional lacquered pottery . Artists before Li simply took pottery as the base for the lacquer , while Li sought to preserve the linear patterns and texture of pottery along with the " layered light " effect of lacquer right on the surface of the finished work , thereby adding to its visual impact and achieving a melding of these two millennia-old art forms and blazing a new trail in the arts .  
Can you remember road workers applying a mixture of asphalt and gravel on dirt roads ? How they would spread it lightly and evenly , laying down a black carpet ? Although asphalt smells unpleasant , we love the smooth surface of asphalt roads and the comfortable rides they provide . Indeed for most of us , our impressions about asphalt are pretty much limited to roads .  
It was also at this time that the family adopted corporate management methods . On display alongside the shoulder pole-with its dark , shiny surface hinting at a long history-are a number of other important historical mementos from the company 's past , including a ceiling beam , a brick , and a foundation stone quarried in northern Taipei 's Chili-an district . All these items were taken from the original building before it was torn down to be replaced by the new company headquarters building .  
Chen explains that in the earlier times most of these were made from bamboo pulp and sheets of strawboard , but those were n't water repellent and were easily damaged when it rained . Today they use cardboard or thick construction paper . The white paper surface makes it easy to apply colors and the pleats are more obvious and beautiful .  
The outer surface of the skull of the left temple surrounding the gunshot wound of entry showed abundant soot deposits indicating that the end of the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the head at the time the shot was fired .  
Ocean thermal energy conversion ( OTEC ) , despite its high capital cost , offers specific attractions for small islands because of their typical location close to deep oceans and warm surface water .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
For long-lived , high-level waste , the Act of December 1991 established rules of research that will lead to the appropriate management of such wastes : separation and transmutation of long-lived radioactive elements ; possibilities of reversible and irreversible storage in deep geologic formations ; and laboratory research including conditioning and long-term surface depositories for such wastes .  
Should evidence surface that unlawful acts were committed , we are determined to bring to justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law , as would anyway be the case with any individual who would be responsible for crimes committed , in particular , against civilian population .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The detailed information required for these purposes includes the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . ammunition ) and any specific handling instructions .  
lump-sum amount of 75 per cent of the cost of the full economy-class fare by the least costly scheduled air carrier between the staff member 's duty station and the closest airport to the approved destination is paid in lieu of all applicable entitlements and expenses relating to the specific travel , including local surface transportation , subsistence allowance for rest stopovers , terminal expenses , accompanied baggage and unaccompanied shipment , as well as provision of travel documents and visas .  
The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
There were currently four types of lidar systems under development : ( a ) the back scatter lidar , with a wide range of possible applications in meteorology and climatology ; ( b ) the differential absorption lidar ( DIAL ) , which could provide precise measurements of atmospheric humidity , temperature and pressure ; ( c ) the Doppler lidar , with the capability of improved weather forecasting and applications in global atmospheric studies ; and ( d ) the ranging and altimeter lidar , which could provide very accurate measurements of Earth 's surface features .

This plan is responsible for all programmes related to desertification , surface and ground water pollution , atmospheric pollution , poor sanitation suffered by rural and urban peoples , poor management of industrial and household waste and population growth and its impact on urban sprawl .  
Weather forecasts based on numerical weather prediction utilize , among other things , operational satellite measurements of both surface and upper air winds and atmospheric temperature fields ;  
The main scientific objectives of the mission were the global study of the physical parameters of the planet Mars ( atmosphere , surface and interior ) so as to trace the complex history of its evolution since it was first formed .  
The two major releases from surface and underground mining relevant to reprocessing and utilization are mineral wastes ( overburden and waste rock ) and contaminated waters ( acidic , metal-laden discharges from waste disposal sites and workings ) .  
The mathematical model for the determination of outer limits from straight baselines on the surface of a geodetic reference ellipsoid is computationally more intensive than the method of envelopes of arcs .  
From a geomorphological perspective , the shelf in ideal cases is the part of the seabed adjacent to the continent which forms a kind of large submerged terrace , the average surface of which generally dips gently seaward .  
Percussion test : The specimen shall be placed on a sheet of lead which is supported by a smooth solid surface and struck by the flat face of a mild steel bar so as to cause an impact equivalent to that resulting from a free drop of 1.4 kg through 1 m .  
One of the most important challenges being tackled by Ukrainian specialists is to study the seas surface , atmospheric and oceanic dynamics , and marine temperatures and colours by means of satellite data , such research constituting a basic component of environmental monitoring and surveillance of navigational hazards .  
This camera applies the international standard for photographic images with frame dimensions of 230 x 230 mm , an enlarged photographed area of the Earths surface , improved resolution and an envisaged automatic exchange between up to 12 spectral zones ; in addition , the camera offers automatic exposure regulation and adjustment to take account of cloud cover and other conditions at the time of photography .  
Technological and human-induced ecological hazards , such as accidental releases of chemicals in surface water catchments , dumping of toxic and radioactive materials in coastal zones or on the high seas , and hydrological and climatic problems created by excessive withdrawals from large water bodies etc . add to or complicate problems related to natural hazards , particularly in CIS countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia . 
The principal topics covered were the following : electromagnetic radiation , the reflective properties of various types of materials on the surface of the Earth and elementary optics ; electronic imaging ; georeferencing of objects in the field , on maps and on satellite imagery ; remote sensing for land use planning and environmental monitoring ; and Earth resources and environmental satellites .  
Though national and local approaches to the problem of mine clearance have existed for decades , millions of landmines and other unexploded ordnance are still buried in the soil or scattered on the surface in over 60 countries around the world , and thousands of innocent people are being killed or injured every day .  
In the light of the developing situation on the ground and particularly the resumption of hostilities in May 2000 , which necessitated the rapid reinforcement of the military component of the Mission and consequently the rapid transportation of contingent-owned equipment to the mission area , 10,635 and 2,057 metric tons of contingent-owned equipment were transported by air and surface , respectively , resulting in the unforeseen additional requirements totalling $ 22,023,000 .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
Many delegations called for increased international cooperation in financial and technology assistance in building capacity , education , training and raising public awareness , particularly in systematic observations of the Earths atmosphere and of the oceans and the land surface , including satellite data .  
As stated in paragraph 13 of the attached executive summary , the peak levels of production recorded in phases VI and VIII of the programme were only achieved at the expense of long-term damage to the oil-bearing structures utilized , and with increasing collateral damage to surface facilities operating beyond recommended ( and safe ) maintenance periods .  
The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .  
The shuttle had mapped 90 per cent of the earths surface with unprecedented precision , and astronauts on board had discovered and confirmed ancient impact craters on earth , tracked deforestation , monitored coral reefs , studied air and water pollution and documented the effects of drought , floods , volcanoes and hurricanes .  
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
The task of preparing for the arrival of external drilling contractors for the almost 400 new wells planned is an enormous one , requiring numerous access roads , earth-moving and foundation works to allow access to the incoming drilling units and to construct , repair and maintain surface facilities required to treat current and future crude oil production flows before export or refining can be undertaken .
