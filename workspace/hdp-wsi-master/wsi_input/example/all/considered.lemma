It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .

The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .  After the two-state theory incident in the summer of 1999 , the communist military aircraft even considered west of the strait 's central line as the scope of their free movements .  
It will soon be 100 days since Little Bush became US President , but the impression he has given observers at home and abroad is one that can not be considered as good - - one that he handles international affairs in an intransigent , conceited and obstinate manner , showing no strategic vision whatsoever .  
The mechanism for talks between the two associations on the two sides of the strait is presently still the most feasible and workable consultative channel .

In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .

Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .

For example , an item called " using signal guns to launch hand grenades , " which had won an award in demonstrations and which quite a few people considered " innovative , " was eliminated because the yardstick of actual combat exposed numerous shortcomings such as the fact that it was complex to do , it could easily be dangerous , and its combat value was not great .

Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .

The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior .

For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan .

Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election .

"  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern .

Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture .

He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
In local folk-worship traditions in Taiwan , there are so-called " unmarried miss temples , " dedicated to women who died unwed . Deceased unmarried women are considered to be among the " lonely souls without homes " to whom offerings are made on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month each year . This is because memorial tablets for unmarried women can not be placed in the family home after their deaths , so there is no one to make offerings to them in the afterlife .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation .

A five-star planetary alignment can last three to five days , and in Chinese astrology signifies " the appearance of a shining king . " Professor Huang calculates that there should have been one such alignment during the regency of Empress Dowager Wei Hou , who was murdered in 710 AD . But there is no record of any such alignment , and he speculates that male-oriented dynastic historians may have considered a woman 's regency an aberration , and accordingly kept quiet about such an auspicious sign occurring while the empress dowager was in power .  
It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .

For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C .

In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy . At a time when standard universities and colleges seem unsure of their own development and are establishing an increasing number of money-making , functional departments , they have begun to impinge on a market formerly considered the preserve of vocational schools . Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers . " When they were young the country had nothing , and they were confined to small , pragmatic dreams .

considered the question of capital punishment as a very sensitive human rights issue , and had always requested that it should be considered in international forums in a constructive and cooperative spirit .

These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments .

In the light of the above , it is considered that the provision of exchange of information and consultations only in the case of water utilization liable to cause significant harm would be sufficient in respect of satisfying the criteria of equitable and reasonable utilization of international watercourses .  
Moreover , since there were wide variations in the actual vacancy rates in different duty stations , and the standard cost of each post differed in terms of post adjustment and the percentage attributable to common staff costs , the Board considered that the adoption of a uniform vacancy rate for formulation of budgetary proposals for staff costs was likely to give rise to significant inaccuracies ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol .

I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
In view of the politico-economic environment in which well over half the 1995 expenditure was incurred , it is still considered that the additional resources , both human and financial , which would be required to analyse and forecast the inflation and exchange rate variation factors with any degree of reliability would be costly to UNHCR , the degree of reliability would most probably not be reached , and the added value to UNHCR would most probably be minimal .  
There were also those who considered that , in view of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly , the profound and far-reaching changes that have transformed the international security landscape since the end of the cold war era , and the advent of a new century , profitable use could be made of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to review and assess progress towards the " grand vision " and programme of action of the Final Document .  
The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries .

The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
However , CPC had been unable to reach agreement on the content of that document at its session in June 1996 and had recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to present to the current session of the General Assembly , through CPC at its September session , a short and concise document to be considered for inclusion in the proposed medium-term plan based on relevant resolutions and decisions of intergovernmental bodies and taking into account the views expressed by the members of CPC .

The hiring of mercenaries to guarantee internal security and public order in African States could be regarded as a threat to the inalienable sovereign responsibility of States for their own internal order and security and to their responsibility to prevent the repression of their citizens or the violation of their human rights ; and the international community should examine the extent to which it considered the recruitment of mercenaries to be legal .

Firstly , Costa Rica wishes to express its satisfaction at the initiation of the consultative process for the formulation of the medium-term plan , agreed in General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 , which , with the initiation of systematic consultations with sectoral and technical bodies of the United Nations , will allow the experts directly involved in programme implementation to give constructive expression to their views and for these views to be considered when making budgetary allocations .

Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered .

It had also considered a study , prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 51 , entitled " Survey of liability regimes relevant to the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law " ( A / CN . 4 / 471 ) .  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
Given that the rules they set forth were complementary , and that States parties to the Code would , ipso facto , be called upon to recognize the existence of an international criminal court , her delegation considered that the Commission should concentrate on drafting two harmonious and complementary texts of equal legal value , whether separate or incorporated .  
On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .  
At its fifty-second session , in October 1994 , the Human Rights Committee , the treaty body established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , decided to invite henceforth representatives of specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies to make oral presentations at the Committee 's pre-sessional working group on article 40 of the Covenant during which the Human Rights Committee conducts a preliminary review of periodic reports which are scheduled to be considered by the plenary . 
While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
Like other Member States , Israel considered article 20 to be complex and sometimes confusing because it attempted to include all the major conventional sources of international law , irrespective of the extent to which they had been accepted as law by the international community .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
IV of the Constitution of the United Mexican States provide that public service in the armed forces is compulsory ; that it is an obligation for Mexicans to receive military instruction making them fit to exercise the rights of citizens skilled in the handling of weapons and proficient in military discipline ; that males who are Mexicans and have reached 18 years of age shall be considered to be citizens of the Republic and that it is a prerogative of those persons to bear arms in the armed forces for the defence of the Republic and its institutions .

Although his delegation acknowledged that the obstacles to its inclusion were more political than legal , it considered that the task assigned to the Preparatory Committee and the court itself would be incomplete if such a core crime were not included in the statute of the court .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
He considered the creative freedom for women to express themselves , to create and nourish culture and to bring into the light suffering that stays hidden because of societal taboos an essential means to overcome the many manifestations of the use of violence against women , which can negatively affect their enjoyment of the right of freedom of opinion and expression .  
As stated in those agreed conclusions , the Commission considered that its effectiveness and efficiency could be improved through innovative methods of work , including inviting experts to participate in the substantive debate on selected issues as part of the regular work of the Commission .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
After having considered the note , the Executive Committee , at its forty-seventh session , adopted a conclusion on comprehensive and regional approaches within a protection framework , 4 which identified certain principal elements of protection-based comprehensive approaches and encouraged States , in coordination and cooperation with each other , and with international organizations , if applicable , to consider the adoption of such approaches . 
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
In fact , we are aware and convinced that merely meeting the requirements of the ritual of holding periodic elections is not enough and can in no way be considered decisive in establishing and guaranteeing lasting democracy in a country , particularly in a developing country such as my own , which is classified among the least developed .  
In his annual report on the work of the Organization ( A / 52 / 1 ) , the Secretary-General considered that post-conflict situations have special requirements and that successful recovery from disturbances caused by conflicts is assisted by facing up quickly to general development challenges , and the provision of appropriate legal frameworks , stable social and political environments and economic opportunities .  
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Bearing in mind the place where the unknown substance was released , it can be established that the most risky area for infection is a zone covering 15 to 20 kilometres to the west and 20 to 25 kilometres to the east of the Gir \ x { 93ee } air corridor , although the whole territory of Matanzas Province is considered a probable infected zone . 
Regarding energy as a substantive topic , it was considered vital to take into account a number of pertinent issues , such as the uneven distribution of fuel and energy resources , the interactive management of energy , energy savings , the problems related to biomass sources from contaminated forests and the need for a total energy system , and the special needs of small island countries .  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
During the period under review , the special process received a total of 3,058 cases through non-governmental organizations and field offices , which were considered , processed and transmitted to the authorities allegedly held responsible .  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
In addition , during its session , the Governing Council considered reports submitted by a number of Governments on the distribution of compensation awarded to successful claimants in category B . The Council agreed that further discussion was needed regarding the situation where , following the transfer of funds to the relevant Governments or international organizations , awarded compensation has not been distributed to individual claimants , for one reason or another , after a reasonable period of time has elapsed . 
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
We need to pursue these relevant Utopias and I believe the programme proposed by the 28 countries should be considered in the light of the present international context , but also within the expanding horizon of an international disarmament agenda which is intended to have a decisive impact on the status quo and advance even further the swing of the pendulum in the global security system . 
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
The many initiatives which had subsequently led to the drafting of new instruments were considered by delegations as particularly valuable , as was the exploration of especially critical problems encountered in the modern world , including attention to issues in the field of social and economic rights , such as the right to housing , extreme poverty and indigenous rights . 
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies submitted by Bulgaria be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .

While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
If such an approach was to be adopted , the following alternatives could be considered : to leave it for national conflict-of-laws rules to determine the law applicable to the questions of liability and damages ; to draft a specific uniform conflict-of-laws rule ; or to determine directly which conflict-of-laws rule should be applied ( e.g . , the conflict-of-laws rule of the country in which the certification authority was registered or otherwise authorized to do business ) .  
Having completed its preliminary consideration of the legal issues and possible provisions to be considered in uniform rules on digital signatures , as reflected in part II of the present report , the Working Group noted that , for lack of sufficient time , it could not enter into any detailed discussion of the issues of incorporation by reference at the current session . 
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
She asked whether the proposals for substantive reform put forward by the Secretariat , such as those concerning the Department of Administration and Management , the merging of the three departments dealing with economic and social issues and the establishment of a Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services , would be included in the budget proposals for 1998-1999 or whether they would be considered in the form of revised estimates .  
However , my Special Representative and all observers concur that , at this time of renewed violence and growing political and social tension , the situation in Haiti is more precarious than it was four months ago , when the authorized strength of the Mission was considered a minimum .

The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks .

It is widely known that , in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction , our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters .

They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power .  
In his daily life , he was consistently clean in fulfilling his official responsibilities , without contamination at all .  He is considered an excellent political cadre who was the most convincing and the most authoritative in the eyes of the masses .

The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
In the wake of former president Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in 1995 , communist China 's air force overturned the decades-long tacit understanding that its fighter aircraft would not venture far over the sea .

It will soon be 100 days since Little Bush became US President , but the impression he has given observers at home and abroad is one that can not be considered as good - - one that he handles international affairs in an intransigent , conceited and obstinate manner , showing no strategic vision whatsoever .  
The mechanism for talks between the two associations on the two sides of the strait is presently still the most feasible and workable consultative channel .  The government has not considered changing or adjusting the consultative mechanism for the two associations from the two sides of the strait .

In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .  They are mature and stable in terms of their technological standard , and capable of independently handling more complicated situations .  Moreover , since they are the ones who give demonstrations and guidance to novices , they are considered the " high production units " in the operation .  
The MAC emphasized : After reviewing the specifics of the policy on the three mini links , it is initially decided that the restriction of " one area and one port " will be relaxed conditionally on the premise that security and effective management are considered , and passenger transport facilities will be completed first and passenger service center planned for Kinmen 's Shuitou Port before opening the port for passenger transport service .  
NSC Consultative Committee Member Ko Chen-heng has seriously considered this issue .  He thinks that the system under which the military 's command authority belongs to the minister of national defense in peacetime and to the chief of the general staff during wartime is dangerous and is faulty in design .  Ko Chen-heng told his friends in private that the only military suggestion that he , as a Consultative Committee member , has given President Chen is : " The command authority in the military command system must be an integral whole and should not be divided " .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
When constructing new ports , roads , and railways and optic fiber and ground satellite projects , counties and cities in the coastal regions have fully considered the practical needs for coastal defense and incorporated them into unified planning and construction .  This is to ensure coordination in coastal defense management and economic development of coastal regions .  
Zhao Leji , a native of Qinghai , has made himself conspicuous within a very short period of time in recent years , and is now the youngest governor in the country .

Japanese militarists described Taiwan and the northeast of our country as Japan 's lifeline and considered the entire Korean Peninsula as their permanent colony .  They included all of Asia in Japan 's sphere of influence .  Those false reasoning and fallacies have long been discarded in the garbage can of history .  
For example , an item called " using signal guns to launch hand grenades , " which had won an award in demonstrations and which quite a few people considered " innovative , " was eliminated because the yardstick of actual combat exposed numerous shortcomings such as the fact that it was complex to do , it could easily be dangerous , and its combat value was not great .  Therefore , it was not included among the items to be converted to actual use .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
One of the most prominent mistakes in this misunderstanding zone is this : Some immature methods adopted in the past by the Chinese intellectual elite and common Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have been considered as China 's democratic methods .  These methods have been treated as a standard for the evaluation of China 's current democratic progress .  Consequently , a misunderstanding zone has been created .

As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
Those who proposed " unrestricted warfare " fully considered the changing military operations brought by the new technological means , but they failed to consider the rules , morals , and conscience of mankind that also govern the course of war .  The new military means and modes of warfare are still governed by traditional rules of war , including the restrictions of international laws ; there is no legal vacuum .  
However , relevant media personalities have totally not seriously and sincerely considered whether or not his remarks are reasonable and whether or not they are based on certain facts .  Instead , they have bludgeoned him saying he has " interfered in freedom of the press . "  They have even raised the matter to the high plane of principle and said the Central Government wants Hong Kong to practice " uniformity of public opinion " and has violated the principle " one country , two systems . "

As they entered the farm , Chang Chih-man led his bride-to-be to the front of a grave . The tombstone could not be considered grandiose and was made of gray stone slabs and concrete . Carved on its surface was the inscription , " Tomb of the misfortunate father and sons Chang Chi-lang , Tsung-jen and Kuo-jen who unjustly met their deaths on the night of 4 April , 1947 . " The parallel verses to each side read : " Two sons as companions ; Patriotic fervor floods the plains beyond the town . "

For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
Before the 1970s , ceramic art in Taiwan could only truly be considered a ceramics industry , and was still developing in terms of mass production .

They demolished the Empress of Heaven Temple ( built by the Qing court ) and other symbols of Chinese culture . They employed what they considered to be the most modern urban planning methods , imported from the West . Not even in Japan proper did they have an opportunity to implement such a comprehensive urban design .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Frankly speaking , the entire educational system in Taiwan is seriously lacking in understanding of aboriginal culture . Thus , not only Han Chinese , but even many indigenous people themselves , are mostly in the dark about their culture . This has meant that many pieces of aboriginal music already widely considered to be " treasures of world culture " ( please see accompanying article ) do not get the attention in Taiwan that they should .

At that time , yew wood was not considered suitable for making utensils . The only thing it was thought fit for was to be burnt to make charcoal . But big yews left standing in the forests were put to another use : with their well-developed root systems , they could be used as anchoring points when moving timber : steel cables would be run around them to haul together the logs from felled trees .  
In former times , because the yew 's wood was not considered straight enough , it was not valued for making furniture or other utensils . But once people in Taiwan were well clothed and well fed , and their aspirations turned from the simply utilitarian towards a desire for valuable and unusual artistic artefacts , what had formerly been seen as the yew 's defects now became its virtues .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ?

He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
In local folk-worship traditions in Taiwan , there are so-called " unmarried miss temples , " dedicated to women who died unwed . Deceased unmarried women are considered to be among the " lonely souls without homes " to whom offerings are made on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month each year . This is because memorial tablets for unmarried women can not be placed in the family home after their deaths , so there is no one to make offerings to them in the afterlife .  
Edwin Yen was a pioneer who was studying and promoting sex education for schoolchildren as long as 20 years ago ; he is now director of the Health Education Department at NTNU and executive director of the Mercy Memorial Foundation .

Children were left to find out for themselves as best they could .  
Even for Mr . and Mrs . Chang Erh-lien , who had run a nursery for nearly 30 years and considered themselves very knowledgeable about preschool children , the reality of foster parenting was far different from what they had been anticipating .

He became aware of how vastly different the Buddhist carvings in the Yungang Grottoes were to ancient Greek sculptures : the East emphasized tranquillity , capturing the essence , whereas the West stressed unrestrained energy and realistic depiction .

A five-star planetary alignment can last three to five days , and in Chinese astrology signifies " the appearance of a shining king . " Professor Huang calculates that there should have been one such alignment during the regency of Empress Dowager Wei Hou , who was murdered in 710 AD .

It should be noted that , according to international standards , a loan is considered " non-performing " if interest has not been paid in three months . But Taiwan uses a more lax standard of six months . And if you figure in special cases of the government stepping in to negotiate debt rescheduling for selected enterprises , or the postponement of debt repayment for victims of the September 21 earthquake , the real non-performance ratio for banks in Taiwan is over 10% , with total bad loans approaching NT $ 1.5 trillion .

For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C .

The earliest tea in Taiwan was wild tea growing in the mountains around Puli , Nantou County . A small number of Aborigines also cultivated tea for medicinal purposes , but because under theories of Chinese medicine it was considered " cold , " it was not deemed suitable as a casual drink .

In point of fact , the development of technical and vocational education can not be considered in isolation from the motivations of broader education policy .

Little wonder then that concerns have been voiced that measures introduced by the Ministry of Education will gradually result in the collapse of technical and vocational education .  
The third and fourth generations ( born in the 1940s and 1950s ) are the " post-war baby boomers .

Developed country representatives underlined their support for the process through contributions to the two funds : they are both considered important , since it is essential that the high quality of Secretariat work be maintained ; and necessary that developing countries , in particular least developed countries , be well represented at forthcoming sessions of the Committee .  
Issues addressed here are closely related to those being considered by the General Assembly at its current session with respect to international cooperation in the eradication of poverty in developing countries , the International Year for Poverty Eradication , the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development , the coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences and the comprehensive policy review of operational activities .

His delegation therefore considered that the Commission 's decision to link the notion of proportionality to the regime of prohibited countermeasures envisaged in part two , article 14 was correct , but felt that it was inappropriate to prohibit any conduct which derogated from basic human rights , since neither the text nor the commentary indicated specific criteria for determining which human rights were " basic " .  
6 Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries .

Certain parties seemed to have adopted a selective approach to the Rio commitments , either because the threats posed to the global environment had been exaggerated or because a decision had been taken to ignore the dangers , leaving them for future generations .  Perhaps some considered that the problems were specific only to the third world , but that view was shortsighted .

considered the question of capital punishment as a very sensitive human rights issue , and had always requested that it should be considered in international forums in a constructive and cooperative spirit .  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .

Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
Referring to paragraph 25 of the report concerning communications in which individuals or non-governmental organizations reported human rights violations , she said that her delegation insisted on the need to make judicious use of those procedures in order to avoid giving free rein to partisan judgements , and considered that , in order to preserve the credibility of the United Nations , the Organization should make every effort to prevent the machinery and procedures from being exploited for unacknowledged purposes .  
Though aware of the precarious security situation and the poor condition of the infrastructure in Goma and the consequent need for official government assistance , the Commission considered that the insistence of Zairian officials on attending all its interviews was obstructive , unhelpful and not in keeping with the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1013 ( 1995 ) , and especially paragraphs 5 ( a ) and ( e ) thereof .

The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments .

All norms and principles of human rights enshrined in regional and international human rights instruments and covenants shall be an integral part of the constitution of the Sudan and any law , decree , executive order or policy measure contrary thereto shall be considered null and void and unconstitutional ;  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
of those Conventions had deviated from customary international law on certain matters , France nevertheless considered that the rules concerning reservations contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention functioned fairly well and that the system established in 1969 must not be abandoned in favour of positions adopted by some international human rights bodies concerning the allegedly special case of human rights treaties . 
Firstly , Costa Rica wishes to express its satisfaction at the initiation of the consultative process for the formulation of the medium-term plan , agreed in General Assembly resolution 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 , which , with the initiation of systematic consultations with sectoral and technical bodies of the United Nations , will allow the experts directly involved in programme implementation to give constructive expression to their views and for these views to be considered when making budgetary allocations .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
The Human Rights Committee , after having considered the initial report of Estonia ( CCPR / C / 79 / Add . 59 ) in October 1995 , had expressed satisfaction at the fundamental and positive changes in Estonia , which provided a better political , constitutional and legal framework for the implementation of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Several options may be considered , such as : ( a ) encouraging governments to provide greater support to national , regional and international institutions ; ( b ) requesting the governing bodies of international organizations to give a high priority to work in support of the UNFCCC process ; ( c ) revising the guidance to the GEF so as to encourage support for specific methodological issues ; and ( d ) providing for additions to the secretariat budget and / or contributions to the supplementary fund for the period 1998-1999 .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] / in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Fully aware of the enormous risk inherent in the presence of a large number of refugees along their shared borders , the three States , acting together and backed by UNHCR in particular , have continually sounded the alarm and requested the assistance of the international community for a triple operation they considered essential : the repatriation of the refugees to their respective countries ; the disarmament of some 40,000 runaway Rwandan soldiers and their adjuncts , the interahamwe militia ; and finally , encampment in areas far from the frontiers for refugees who opted to remain abroad .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in accordance with his mandate , to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;  
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered . 
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Intensive humanitarian assistance was required from the international community to improve the living conditions and relieve their suffering until a just and comprehensive solution was reached in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) of 11 December 1948 .  Lebanon considered that the presence of Palestine refugees in its territory was temporary and was a consequence of Israeli occupation and the continuation of the Middle East crisis .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to encourage the independent expert to finalize his interim report on possible long-term approaches to enhancing the effective operation of the human rights treaty system [ 10 ] in time for the final report to be considered by the Commission on Human Rights , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 120 of 20 December 1993 , at its fifty-third session ;

It had also considered a study , prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 51 , entitled " Survey of liability regimes relevant to the topic of international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law " ( A / CN . 4 / 471 ) .  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
Given that the rules they set forth were complementary , and that States parties to the Code would , ipso facto , be called upon to recognize the existence of an international criminal court , her delegation considered that the Commission should concentrate on drafting two harmonious and complementary texts of equal legal value , whether separate or incorporated .  
On the question whether the scope of the draft articles should be extended to include other activities not prohibited by international law that did not involve the risk of significant transboundary harm but that nevertheless caused such harm , her delegation considered that , at the current stage in the progressive development of international law , the draft articles should cover all situations that might entail the strict liability of States for lawful acts .  
At its fifty-second session , in October 1994 , the Human Rights Committee , the treaty body established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , decided to invite henceforth representatives of specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies to make oral presentations at the Committee 's pre-sessional working group on article 40 of the Covenant during which the Human Rights Committee conducts a preliminary review of periodic reports which are scheduled to be considered by the plenary . 
While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
Like other Member States , Israel considered article 20 to be complex and sometimes confusing because it attempted to include all the major conventional sources of international law , irrespective of the extent to which they had been accepted as law by the international community .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
IV of the Constitution of the United Mexican States provide that public service in the armed forces is compulsory ; that it is an obligation for Mexicans to receive military instruction making them fit to exercise the rights of citizens skilled in the handling of weapons and proficient in military discipline ; that males who are Mexicans and have reached 18 years of age shall be considered to be citizens of the Republic and that it is a prerogative of those persons to bear arms in the armed forces for the defence of the Republic and its institutions .  
The right of a detained or imprisoned person to be visited by and to consult and communicate , without delay or censorship and in full confidentiality , with his legal counsel may not be suspended or restricted save in exceptional circumstances , to be specified by law or lawful regulations , when it is considered indispensable by a judicial or other authority in order to maintain security and good order .  
Although his delegation acknowledged that the obstacles to its inclusion were more political than legal , it considered that the task assigned to the Preparatory Committee and the court itself would be incomplete if such a core crime were not included in the statute of the court .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
He considered the creative freedom for women to express themselves , to create and nourish culture and to bring into the light suffering that stays hidden because of societal taboos an essential means to overcome the many manifestations of the use of violence against women , which can negatively affect their enjoyment of the right of freedom of opinion and expression .  
As stated in those agreed conclusions , the Commission considered that its effectiveness and efficiency could be improved through innovative methods of work , including inviting experts to participate in the substantive debate on selected issues as part of the regular work of the Commission .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
The delegation of Colombia considered that the reference in article 6 , paragraph 4 the representation of different forms of civilization was not only unnecessary but also constituted a dangerous precedent in the universal conception of the human rights , considering that gross human rights violations often took place using as a pretext the necessity of defending particular forms of civilization .  
After having considered the note , the Executive Committee , at its forty-seventh session , adopted a conclusion on comprehensive and regional approaches within a protection framework , 4 which identified certain principal elements of protection-based comprehensive approaches and encouraged States , in coordination and cooperation with each other , and with international organizations , if applicable , to consider the adoption of such approaches . 
The Commission , however , decided that the automatic stay should cover not only execution of claims but also the individual actions and proceedings conducted prior to execution ; that was considered necessary to allow the foreign representative the necessary temporary respite to organize the affairs of the debtor without having to participate in possibly numerous actions against the debtor .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
The Commission considered the question whether the Model Provisions should expressly provide that a foreign representative had procedural " standing " ( a concept in some procedural systems referred to by expressions such as " active procedural legitimation " , " active legitimation " or " legitimation " ) to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors ( such actions were sometimes referred to as " Paulian actions " ) .  
The Commission also considered the report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 17 ) , submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1996 / 12 , concerning the problems related to the right to enjoy an adequate standard of living ; foreign debt , economic adjustment policies and their effects on the full enjoyment of human rights and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
In fact , we are aware and convinced that merely meeting the requirements of the ritual of holding periodic elections is not enough and can in no way be considered decisive in establishing and guaranteeing lasting democracy in a country , particularly in a developing country such as my own , which is classified among the least developed .  
In his annual report on the work of the Organization ( A / 52 / 1 ) , the Secretary-General considered that post-conflict situations have special requirements and that successful recovery from disturbances caused by conflicts is assisted by facing up quickly to general development challenges , and the provision of appropriate legal frameworks , stable social and political environments and economic opportunities .  
And only a few days ago the Assembly extensively considered the question of Palestine and expressed its views in no uncertain terms on the Government of Israel 's continued evasion of the commitments and agreements reached as well as its blatant unilateral measures to impose a fait accompli in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Bearing in mind the place where the unknown substance was released , it can be established that the most risky area for infection is a zone covering 15 to 20 kilometres to the west and 20 to 25 kilometres to the east of the Gir \ x { 93ee } air corridor , although the whole territory of Matanzas Province is considered a probable infected zone . 
Regarding energy as a substantive topic , it was considered vital to take into account a number of pertinent issues , such as the uneven distribution of fuel and energy resources , the interactive management of energy , energy savings , the problems related to biomass sources from contaminated forests and the need for a total energy system , and the special needs of small island countries .  
A paradox arises in that , while globalization may be considered desirable because of the potential beneficial effects on national economic growth , at the same time , current levels of growth and dynamism in a particular economy may determine whether the effects of globalization are positive or negative .  
At a time of universal consensus that the international protection of human beings against gross and systematic violations of their basic human rights is no longer considered as interference with the sovereignty and internal affairs of the State , we also have to recognize the legal , moral and political responsibility of the international community , above all the powerful States in the region , to prevent acts of genocide and to protect the population against other gross and systematic violations of human rights .  
During the period under review , the special process received a total of 3,058 cases through non-governmental organizations and field offices , which were considered , processed and transmitted to the authorities allegedly held responsible .  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
In addition , during its session , the Governing Council considered reports submitted by a number of Governments on the distribution of compensation awarded to successful claimants in category B . The Council agreed that further discussion was needed regarding the situation where , following the transfer of funds to the relevant Governments or international organizations , awarded compensation has not been distributed to individual claimants , for one reason or another , after a reasonable period of time has elapsed . 
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
We need to pursue these relevant Utopias and I believe the programme proposed by the 28 countries should be considered in the light of the present international context , but also within the expanding horizon of an international disarmament agenda which is intended to have a decisive impact on the status quo and advance even further the swing of the pendulum in the global security system . 
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .  
The many initiatives which had subsequently led to the drafting of new instruments were considered by delegations as particularly valuable , as was the exploration of especially critical problems encountered in the modern world , including attention to issues in the field of social and economic rights , such as the right to housing , extreme poverty and indigenous rights . 
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
However , instead of differentiating the list of relief available to those representatives , it was considered preferable to express those differences by including a wording in the article that would make it clear that , in granting relief under article 17 to a representative of a foreign non-main proceeding , the court had to be satisfied that the relief related to assets falling under the authority of that representative or that it concerned information required in the foreign non-main proceeding .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies submitted by Bulgaria be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by Ethiopia be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by Panama be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
While some delegations noted that there was a need to update the report of the Secretary-General containing a preliminary set of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 10 ) , a number of other delegations considered that it was a valuable and useful document .  
If such an approach was to be adopted , the following alternatives could be considered : to leave it for national conflict-of-laws rules to determine the law applicable to the questions of liability and damages ; to draft a specific uniform conflict-of-laws rule ; or to determine directly which conflict-of-laws rule should be applied ( e.g . , the conflict-of-laws rule of the country in which the certification authority was registered or otherwise authorized to do business ) .  
Having completed its preliminary consideration of the legal issues and possible provisions to be considered in uniform rules on digital signatures , as reflected in part II of the present report , the Working Group noted that , for lack of sufficient time , it could not enter into any detailed discussion of the issues of incorporation by reference at the current session . 
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
She asked whether the proposals for substantive reform put forward by the Secretariat , such as those concerning the Department of Administration and Management , the merging of the three departments dealing with economic and social issues and the establishment of a Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services , would be included in the budget proposals for 1998-1999 or whether they would be considered in the form of revised estimates .  
However , my Special Representative and all observers concur that , at this time of renewed violence and growing political and social tension , the situation in Haiti is more precarious than it was four months ago , when the authorized strength of the Mission was considered a minimum .  
This concern has found expression at the meetings , seminars and study groups held in various parts of the world that have considered the grievous suffering caused by the sanctions and by the embargo and that have addressed urgent appeals to the United Nations and the international community as a whole for action to lift the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and to enable that people , through the use of its own resources and capacities , to secure the provision of its basic civilian needs . 
Before proceeding to the concrete facts that will serve as evidence of flagrant violation by the separatists of the norms of international humanitarian law , it is necessary to consider the issue as to whether the " ethnic cleansing " referred to in the above-mentioned documents and as it is being pursued in Abkhazia can be considered a crime against humanity and a form of genocide , since upon that depends the appropriateness of raising the question of bringing the accused to trial before an international tribunal .  
Comparisons of the two types of solutions considered at the preliminary pilot project stage provided ample confirmation that the " tunnel " option was more realistic and advantageous , from the technical , economic and environmental standpoint , than the " bridge " option .  
In its decision 1996 / 119 , the Sub _ Commission , having considered that report decided to request the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its forty _ ninth session a revised version of the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity contained in annex II of the final report , taking into account the comments and observations received .  
When the Human Rights Committee considered France 's report in 1983 , an extremely instructive debate took place on the validity of the reservations made by France to article 4 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 35 The expert from the German Democratic Republic asserted that France had confirmed that reservations to article 4 were permissible , in response to which the representative of France said that the reservations were limited to paragraph 1 of that article . 
The section prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex , race , colour , nationality , religion , political opinion , social or family status or other similar circumstances .  Notwithstanding the fact that this principle was , before the Act entered into effect , considered to be one of the unwritten basic principles of administrative law , it was deemed necessary to enact an express provision to this effect .  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
Parts are considered equivalent to one piece when a suitable method of glued assembly is used as for instance Lindermann joint , tongue and groove joint , ship lap or rabbet joint ; or butt joint with at least two corrugated metal fasteners at each joint , or when other methods at least equally effective are used . 
The large packagings shall be dropped onto a rigid , non-resilient , smooth , flat and horizontal surface , in such a manner as to ensure that the point of impact is that part of the base of the large packagings considered to be the most vulnerable . 
Two representatives from North and South America respectively complained about the role of the United Nations which was considered to be too weak ; one of them lamented the paternalistic approach of the United Nations towards indigenous issues ; the other stressed the need for the United Nations to take a more active role along with its speciliazed agencies , in particular as far as the voluntary funds were concerned .  
In taking this step , I have considered the prevailing precarious situation in Angola , the incomplete nature of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , the need to give the parties an additional chance to complete the peace process , as well as the need to ensure the security of United Nations and other international personnel in Angola .  
In order to increase the representation of women at the Professional level , FAO developed strategies to identify suitable female candidates and established a roster of international experts working in the area of women in development to be considered for future vacancies .  
Senior staff of the Buildings Management Service inspected the current office arrangements and acknowledged that there was a need for additional office space ; however , they also indicated that the Fund 's requests had to be considered in the context of the amount of space required and the desired location ( the main Secretariat building ) , and the competing requests from United Nations departments and offices for contiguous space for their operations .  
Not many reports have furnished sufficient information concerning such relevant matters as the minimum age at which a juvenile may be charged with a criminal offence , the maximum age at which a person is still considered to be a juvenile , the existence of special courts and procedures , the laws governing procedures against juveniles and how all these special arrangements for juveniles take account of " the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation " .  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
Having considered the final report of Mr . Leandro Despouy on Protection of human rights during states of emergency and the tenth annual list of States which , since 1 January 1985 , have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 19 and Add . 1 ) ,  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
However , the United Nations faced a choice between the widespread use of economic , diplomatic and other sanctions as a standard approach to the conduct of international relations , and their more considered use in exceptionally serious circumstances , when they would be applied in a spirit of openness for a fixed , renewable period to achieve results clearly identified in advance .  
Therefore , the Workshop considered areas in society where participation might be encouraged and developed , as in legal , political , economic and administrative areas , in addition to more traditional areas such as provision of social services , development of non-governmental organizations and access to information .  
The Commission also recalled that the current level of the ceiling ( 25 per cent of net salary ) was based on an administrative decision and that a reduction of the ceiling would be beneficial to duty stations with a large non-pensionable component since a lesser proportion of income would be considered non-pensionable and the relationship between income while in service and income after service would improve . 
The international community has come to realize that only an integrated and holistic response to the issue of landmine contamination , and its multifaceted humanitarian and socio-economic consequences , is capable of bringing real and lasting benefits to those who are considered at risk from those weapons .  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
The receding fears of inflation have allowed some central banks to maintain accommodative monetary policy longer than would have been considered appropriate even a few years ago ; and , with perhaps some exceptions , substantial new tightening should not be needed , at least in the short run . 
As public gatherings are considered by individuals and groups as the last remaining alternative means to express publicly differing views and opinions , given the denial of access to Government _ controlled media and the harassment of the independent press , the direct and indirect limitations presently imposed on such events must be considered highly undesirable .  
The Committee also recommended that the optional protocol should apply in relation to all economic , social and cultural rights as set forth in the Covenant and that this would include all rights contained in articles 1 to 15 with the exception of the right to self _ determination which would be considered only insofar as the economic , social and cultural rights dimensions of that right were involved . 
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .
