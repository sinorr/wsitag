This includes such research work as seed selection , introduction of new varieties , cross breeding , tissue culture and quality analysis to prevent pests and diseases . It also seeks increased productivity and improved quality . Taiwan pineapple s in different export items are expected to play an increasingly important role in international markets .  
Work on the plan , supported by a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development , got under way in July 1984 and is expected to take six years to complete . The ultimate goal is to store the complete text of China 's 25 traditional dynastic histories , around 60 million Chinese characters , onto one thin computer disk , enabling researchers to search , index , and analyze the material by software commands .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
In the space of a year 19 sites with prehistoric relics were discovered . A location at Wangwei stream two kilometers north of the Chuping tribe of the Bunung aboriginal people of Wanfeng was selected . The place is called Qais in Bunung , meaning " the territorial limit . " A search was tried , turning up artifacts as expected .  
Next morning many customers visiting bakeries were surprised to discover the bill came to NT $ 1 more than expected , as bread prices had quietly risen overnight . In the evening when they went to the night market for a bowl of oyster noodles they found new prices written on red paper had unaccountably been stuck over the plastic price boards .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
Just ten years ago research into computer " artificial intelligence " was being abandoned as computer researchers around the world were stymied in getting computers to understand models of human thought . Now Chu , who holds boundless enthusiasm for Chinese-language computers , has declared that he has designed " an intelligent Chinese computer " that " can think , learn skills and communicate directly with people using language . " The first stages of its development have already been completed successfully , and it is expected to be formally unveiled within two years . "  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
Because economic activity was more vigorous at the beginning of 1994 than had been expected , many international economic institutions revised their mid-year estimates of total growth for 1994 upward , yet " actual growth was higher than even the revised estimates . "  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
Developing countries can not be expected to have the depth of accumulated research of say , the data going back 100 years on average for every trout and salmon species in Europe and America , or one rare British species of lycaenid butterfly which has been researched for thirty or forty years , or researchers in the mold of the British entomologist R.H.L . Disney , who has spent 25 years completing over 100 papers about " scuttle flies , " which most people have never even heard of .  
Ma Kai suggests that one reason for the current rise in frictional unemployment is that , now that Taiwan is wealthy , far fewer young people need to be so careful about hanging on to an " iron rice bowl " ( as secure jobs are called by Chinese ) . In addition , the implementation of national health insurance means that job-seekers have one major worry off their minds . It was thus only to be expected that frictional unemployment has risen rapidly .  
Since the 1980s , when US researchers confirmed that taxol ( derived from the Pacific yew , Taxus brevifolia , which belongs to the same genus as the Taiwan yew , Taxus mairei ) is effective in treating ovarian and breast cancers , clinical trials have been conducted or are planned to test the drug against more than 60 types of tumor . As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
In the 1992 production Dance Over the Universe , Kuang Huan 's secret weapon-baby oil-appeared for the first time . As expected , it made an eye-catching spectacle-dancers with shaved heads , bodies nearly naked so they can slide freely ; with the baby oil as a catalyst , linear motions become scarce and are replaced by continuous sliding , twisting and rolling .  
According to Liu , the new US-Japanese guidelines can be seen as an example of " soft containment " by a maritime power against a continental power . It is very worthy of note , in this regard , that the PRC-which has , under Jiang Zemin , repaired relations with the US-responded much less angrily than was expected to the revised guidelines . Indeed the PRC has continued to move forward actively in relations with the US .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
All foster parents receive basic training and understand that abused children are different from other children . Nevertheless , as one foster mother put it , " Until you 've actually been through it , you just ca n't imagine how tough it is . " For most prospective foster parents , the task that lies ahead will be more difficult than expected .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr . Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter . He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful . A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
It involves eighteen countries , headed by the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France and mainland China . The project was originally scheduled for completion in 2005 , but intense competition from a privately owned gene-sequencing company , Celera Genomics , spurred the multinational team to bring forward its timetable , and a full , precise map of the human genome is now expected before 2003 .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .

"  
But performers who are used to singing in the restrained , thin falsetto of Peking Opera can not be expected to open their throats and produce a powerful voice , capable of reaching out over the orchestra and into the ears of the audience , without comprehensive prior training .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
A year earlier , during the celebration of their anniversary in 1999 , they sold models of Taiwan 's earliest locomotive , the Tengyun , " Cloud Rider , " with the words " Remembering our Trains " carved on them . These models were a 1000-unit limited edition , with each selling for NT $ 35,000 ; no-one expected they would sell out in the space of a day-even the TRA were blown away .  
It is expected that interactive services will change the public 's passive TV viewing habits , shifting them toward active choice and control over viewing times . They are also likely to allow audiences to pay for programming according to what they wish to watch . However , the key to success is that the content delivered must be varied and extensive .  
The most exciting game was that against Japan , which went into extra innings , with Chinese Taipei being clipped by only a single run . Head coach Hsu Sheng-ming said that although the team lost , no one had even expected it to give Japan much of a fight , so their efforts both at the plate and in the field were very admirable . Star pitcher Tsao Chin-hui threw until his hand blistered and began bleeding , giving an idea of the determination shown by the whole squad .

If the probability of late effects is proportional to effective dose at low doses , which is probably the case , the collective effective dose is an indicator of the total attributable harm to be expected in that group and its descendants .  
A number of delegations addressed the issue of the continued growth of foreign direct investment in the world economy in the context of expected recovery in world economic performance and growth and continuing structural changes in the world economy .  
In the medium term , this decline in the construction sector can be expected to be reversed given the potential for industrial restructuring , the need for extensive infrastructure investment , and the social pressures for a renewal of the housing stock .  
While national efforts are the key to a successful export strategy , bilateral and multilateral support , including longterm capital , should make a major difference in reducing the period required to achieve the expected results . 
While distinct , small units coordinate those preparations , the respective divisions are expected to provide the main substantive backstopping for those processes and are headed by the same senior staff who supervise the units .  
The experiences at Gorazde and Bihac provide stark evidence that in the absence of consent and cooperation , the " light option " , adopted as an initial measure and supported by air power alone , can not be expected to be effective in protecting the safe areas .  
Two additional manuals , one on public and official use for civil registration and vital statistics records and another on population , education and communication for civil registration , are being planned and are expected to be completed in 1996 .  
Economic development and increasing per capita incomes in rural areas may be expected to be accompanied by substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels not only in modernized agriculture and transportation but also in households , especially if prices in real terms remain as low as in recent years .  
It is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain development in 1997 ( see para . 75 below ) will alert Governments and national agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
All designated depository libraries are expected to place the material received in the care of qualified library staff , to keep it in good order and to make it accessible to the public , free of charge , at reasonable hours .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
A monthly equipment reimbursement rate used with the wet / dry lease system which is the generic fair market value divided by the equipment 's expected useful life expressed in months plus a factor for attrition for wear and tear ; or the replacement value divided by the equipment 's expected useful life expressed in months , whichever is less . 
National participating organizations would be expected to constitute teams of qualified volunteers ( perhaps focusing on a limited number of areas of coverage identified by each organization ) , assure their specialized training and facilitate the rapid deployment and integration of such teams , including the building of linkages with local non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in the receiving countries .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
No country could be expected to stand idle when its own territorial integrity is incessantly threatened by blatant cross-border attacks of a terrorist organization based and operating from a neighbouring country , if that country is unable to put an end to such attacks .  
Those results will then need to be integrated into a clear set of conclusions and policy recommendations for advancing international understanding and consensus on forest issues : on that basis , the Panel is expected to propose coherent approaches to addressing the problem of the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests .  
Four months after the Mission took over from the multinational force , the Secretary-General stated in his report dated 24 July 1995-3 / that UNMIH had made significant progress towards achieving the goals adopted in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) and it was expected that it would be able to maintain a secure and stable environment throughout the current election period and the forthcoming presidential elections .  
Regarding protection of the marine environment , the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities , expected to be adopted at an intergovernmental conference on the subject to be held in Washington , D.C . , from 23 October to 3 November 1995 , would contribute to the effective implementation of relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and various regional maritime conventions and protocols .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
In the Code of Conduct , the collective membership of SACB also agreed that international assistance to Somalia is founded on the basic principle that responsibility for its effective execution shall remain with the Somali people and that responsible Somali authorities are therefore expected to assume their proper role to ensure that conditions exist for the effective implementation of aid activities .  
Upon inquiry , however , the Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .  
The average monthly cost for the previous period was $ 5,000 , but requirements for the current period are expected to be much higher because , while some of these services were covered under the logistic support services contract during the last mandate , the new service contract does not provide for them , thus requiring use of local contractors to provide these services .

In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Parties to the Protocol on Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) , not yet in force , are also expected , as a second step , to negotiate further measures to reduce VOC emissions or their transboundary fluxes and their resulting secondary photochemical oxidant products , taking into account , inter alia , the best available scientific and technological developments , scientifically determined critical levels and internationally accepted target levels , as well as the role of nitrogen oxides in the formation of photochemical oxidants .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
Prices of internationally traded goods ( measured in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) ) are expected to change only marginally over the short term , as productivity increases , trade is further liberalized and competitive forces ( including in commodity markets ) contribute to keep global inflationary pressures at bay .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;

A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
Host Governments are expected to provide stable and transparent regulatory and fiscal environments including supportive administrative frameworks while at the same time providing acceptable socio-economic environments .  
In view of the pattern of meetings and conference-servicing requirements in 1994-1995 , it is expected that any requirements of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that can not be absorbed from within permanent capacity would require an additional appropriation and could not be met from within the reduced budgeted resources for temporary assistance in the approved programme budget for 1996-1997 .

It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
With regard to the progress that has been made since registration in relation to exploration , it is proposed that a workshop / seminar be convened to assess the current state of deep seabed mineral exploration with a view to determining if there are any outstanding technical issues to be overcome as well as to provide the Authority with a clear set of guidelines for work that may be expected of a contractor in a plan of work for exploration approved in the form of a contract ( stage I of the exploration plan ) . 
For this to be a viable arrangement , the current value of the gross salary corresponding to the individual 's level at retirement would have to be used as the point of reference , as it is expected that retirees will be reassigned to functions similar or identical to those for which they were compensated prior to retirement .  
Factual and informative , as opposed to literary or propagandist , this publication has been well received : all of the six issues published so far have been reprinted , and its increased dissemination is expected to stimulate interest in the Tribunal 's work . 
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
As indicated in the March report , further vacancies are expected to be realized through full use of attrition in 1996-1997 ; strict enforcement of retirement age ; freeze in recruitment , subject to limited exceptions ; introduction of a programme for lateral redeployment of staff ; and , should these measures prove insufficient , the involuntary separation of staff .  
In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .  Such harmonization should , however , be treated as a longer-term objective .  
These populations can not be expected to return to their homes if the political systems and national laws to which they are subject fail to offer them reliable guarantees against summary executions , enforced disappearances , torture and unfair trials .  
I should like to mention by way of example the return of UNITA members to the National Assembly , which they left in 1992 ; the return of the expected total number of general officers to the Angolan Armed Forces ; the completion of the selection process of a total 26,300 UNITA military troops for induction into the Angolan Armed Forces ; the re-establishment of government administration , given the continued illegal occupation of certain areas of the national territory ; and the free circulation of goods and people in the areas under its control .  
This positive development now makes judicial corporal punishment for ordinary crimes a historical relic and may be expected substantially to reduce the incidence of such cruel , inhuman and degrading punishments .  
Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
The oversight role of the General Assembly , as stressed in resolution 49 / 28 , may be expected to assume yet greater significance with universal acceptance of the Convention and be further consolidated by the addition of the new law of the sea institutions to the wider group of international organizations responsible in various specialized aspects of ocean affairs , whose competence therein is affirmed and further reinforced by the Convention . 
Bangladesh strongly felt that the independent status of major information centres should be maintained and where necessary restored , and expected the Department of Public Information to take urgent action in respect of the Centre in Dhaka and nominate a director for the Centre . 89 .  Bangladesh attached the highest priority to freedom of speech and the media , in the belief that democracy , development and peace were integrally related and that the free flow of information was an essential component of democracy .  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .  
Although the final account on the construction at ESCAP was to have been submitted to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session , as reported in document A / C . 5 / 50 / 17 , it was expected that there would be additional charges against the project for minor retrofit of main vehicular entrance , final finishes and so on before the exact total project cost could be known .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
Upon enquiry , however , the Advisory Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .  
For example , the Board was pleased to see that UNITAR had prepared detailed plans for the programmes on pollutant release and transfer registers and on national action plans , which provided clearly defined objectives , expected outputs and milestones and set out the respective responsibilities of UNITAR and participating countries .  
Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
The rich variety of geographical , ethnic , cultural and linguistic origins within the staff of the Commission has served , as I intended , to centre and balance the work of the secretariat to meet the required high standards of independence , effectiveness and impartiality , which are expected from a United Nations operation .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
Taking into consideration the overall needs of the country , the expected core resources of the United Nations agencies and the unique operating environment , the United Nations , together with non-governmental organizations spent the latter half of 1996 developing a joint strategy for efficient and targeted assistance in four main areas : emergencies , reintegration , rehabilitation and governance .  
Given the high level of technical sophistication that might be expected from certification authorities and the high level of trust they were intended to generate , certification authorities should , in normal circumstances , be held liable whenever the issuance of faulty certificates resulted in damages .  
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
He agreed that periodic reviews of the Model Law would be desirable because of the particular nature of the subject matter and the rapid technical changes that could be expected ; for that same reason it would also be useful for the current text to be described as the " 1996 version " of the Model Law .  
Although dependence on imported oil and coal for total energy requirements is not expected to be reduced , natural gas is anticipated to have an increasing role in electricity production and in the residential heating market .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
The expected outcome of the Conference is a Lisbon Declaration on Youth Policies and Programmes by ministers responsible for youth to further promote the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond through more focused and specific intersectoral measures at the regional , national and local / municipal levels .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
Further significant deficit declines could hardly be expected at least in the short run , as wage and social security arrears have to be paid ; but fiscal positions remain rather shaky principally because of poor tax collection , probably the major economic disappointment of 1997 .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
In the context which I have just outlined , my country believes that the best chance we have here today to begin work which can produce rapid and concrete results which are understandable and expected by the entire international community lies in establishing as soon as possible an ad hoc committee to negotiate a comprehensive ban on anti _ personnel mines by means of a step _ by _ step approach .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .

The recent statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterating Israel 's absolute sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish people which will never again be divided typifies the uncompromising and brazen attitude of the present Israeli leadership , not the statesmanship that would have been more appropriate , and that is expected of it in the current delicate situation .  
The force would perform such duties as accompanying humanitarian convoys , protecting international humanitarian personnel , protecting some key ports or airports where humanitarian goods are expected to enter Albania , guarding depots and other places where humanitarian goods are kept , and securing safe corridors for humanitarian convoys on parts of national roads .  
Furthermore , my Office 's overall efforts towards the economic reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina , functioning common institutions and the improvement of the overall human rights , policing and judicial situation can be expected to have beneficial effects for the provision of durable solutions for displaced persons and returning refugees .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
Thus , four Governments considered that a conference could suggest ways of reducing or preventing forced or involuntary migration ; one Government was interested in reducing illegal migration , while another hoped that a conference might lead to the regularization of the status of illegal migrants ; and a further four Governments expected that a conference might contribute towards improving the management of migration so that it could be reduced , stabilized or even eliminated . 
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
Furthermore , it is expected that in Bolivia , Colombia and Peru , national alternative development agencies will be in place capable of coordinating and channelling effectively all relevant national and international resources aimed at creating the conditions for the elimination of coca crops , wherever these are illicit or known to feed the cocaine industry .  
At the closing plenary meeting , rapporteurs designated for each of the ministerial round tables would present their summary reports , and all minister participants would be expected to join in a final , interactive discussion .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
The forward rate would be free to differ from the current spot rate and a growing forward discount on the spot exchange rate ( assuming interest rates remained unchanged ) would be an indication of expected future depreciation of the spot rate .  
In the case of contractual preferential rules of origin , considerable political resistance to harmonization can be expected , as such rules are the outcome of intensive negotiations that reflect the vested interests of domestic industries .  
As another commemorative event , the Centre published a bulletin composed of theses , contributions and case studies that are expected to contribute to international , interdisciplinary and practical research on lifelong learning . 
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
International investment agreements ( IIAs ) have as their main objective the intensification of economic cooperation and the creation of favourable conditions for investment with a view to attracting foreign direct investment which is expected to contribute to the economic prosperity of the countries involved .

On the contrary , Japan was of the view that , despite the changes in the world economy , the institutions which had been established at Bretton Woods had played a vital role in containing the current crisis and that , far from scrapping them , the international community should concentrate on improving them so that they could perform the functions which they were expected to perform in the new global economy .  
Although demand for industrial wood raw material is expected to increase in the future , changes in the product mix and changes in production technology and sources of raw material are likely to provide opportunities for production increases consistent with constant ( or modestly increasing ) prices .  
If , for those reasons , such specific form requirements were to remain outside the scope of the Uniform Rules , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be further clarified , possibly in the context of draft article B . The Working Group agreed that discussion as to that issue might need to be reopened at a later stage . 
Finally , in instances of losses due to fraud , which is regarded as a gross violation of the standards of integrity expected of an international civil servant , the staff member may be summarily dismissed if the misconduct is patent , or may be subject to other disciplinary action , in addition to the Organizations efforts to obtain full recovery of the fraudulently misappropriated funds . 
Turning to the question of trade and development , he said that , while trade liberalization was expected to bring about a considerable increase in global income , it must be recognized that , since the early 1970s , the least developed countries had suffered a cumulative decline of 50 per cent in their terms of trade , while the developing countries as a whole had lost $ 290-billion between 1981 and 1991 , which could be attributed to the decline in commodities prices . 
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .

In presenting a budget that broke through the half-billion dollar mark ( the estimated revenue for 1999 / 2000 is expected to total $ 551.6-million ) , 3 the new Finance Minister said that expenditures would be focused on improving the quality of life for all Bermudians . More than $ 511-million was to be spent out of the countrys current account , which is about $ 36-million more than the last projection . 
The CANZ delegations would have expected any questions surrounding such material amounts to have been settled and appropriate adjustments made to the financial statements before the accounts were submitted to Member States : the problem of unliquidated obligations was not new , had been the subject of critical comment by the Board of Auditors and the Advisory Committee in the past and had a direct impact on the funds due to Member States whether as troop contributors or as recipients of credits .  
Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances , or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant , may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct .

Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances , or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant , may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct .  
In order to prepare the country technologically for the expected information explosion of the twenty-first century , South Africa will align its regulatory framework to make use of all the technological advantages offered by wireless local loop and by fixed and mobile satellite services .  
In fact , GPS services are expected to complete the transition from a stand-alone device system to a standard feature integrated into a variety of multifunctional products such as wireless personal communication devices , leading to a drastic reduction in prices . mass consumer market with an average selling price per receiving unit of about $ 100 . 264 bis . 
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
For both privatization and project finance , the most attractive areas are those for which : ( a ) access can be limited ( as in airports , tunnels , bridges and major highways ) ; ( b ) the projected volume of traffic is high ( container ports , freight rail , primary roads ) ; ( c ) the generation of cash is expected to be reliable , and ( d ) foreign exchange earnings are possible . 30 Attractive assets are ones in which there is a scope for monopolistic power . 
The critical issue to be put on the development agenda for Africa is why macroeconomic reforms in Africa have not generated the expected microeconomic responses and have not promoted significant changes in technological capability , improvements in factory-wide skill levels , higher productivity , better manufactured export performance and greater value added in the domestic economies .  These are the elements that determine a countrys or regions successful integration into the global economy .  
In addition to the increased security and political measures taken by the international community , it is the establishment of the Kosovo Transitional Council and the active involvement , on a consultative basis , of political and local leaders in the executive functions of UNMIK that is expected to provide the most important confidence-building mechanism in the medium term for the improvement of the overall situation in Kosovo . 
In contrast , the benefit expected from the Uniform Rules in favour of certain techniques , which were recognized as particularly reliable , irrespective of the circumstance in which they were used , was to create certainty ( through either a presumption or a substantive rule ) , at or before the time any such technique of electronic signature was used ( ex ante ) , that it would result in legal effects equivalent to those of a handwritten signature .  
Decisions to recommend projects for support are considered by interdisciplinary review entities , at substantive , administrative and financial levels , and are based on the technical quality of the proposal , its relationship to national policies and the contribution that project results are expected to make to the further equalization of opportunities by , for and with persons with disabilities .

As the principal forum of the United Nations for the integrated treatment of development and interrelated issues in the areas of trade , finance , investment , technology and sustainable development , UNCTAD is expected to make a substantial contribution to the pursuit of the international communitys common development objectives .  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
A major development in relation to the HIPC initiative had been the Cologne debt initiative ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 44 ) , which linked debt relief to poverty reduction , and aimed at deepening and quickening debt reduction through a reduction in debt sustainability thresholds ; a deeper degree of cancellation ; interim relief ; floating completion points ( A / 54 / 370 , para . 46 ) ; and , as a result , an increase in the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief .  
In that connection , the Hungarian Parliament was expected to adopt a decision to reissue the four Geneva Conventions in a single document in the near future and a national interministerial commission on humanitarian law had been established as a practical means of ensuring the enhanced implementation of international humanitarian law in Hungary .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .  Provisions for such missions had previously been included in the budget section for peacekeeping operations .  
A practical programme of supply management to reduce excess supply , and to bring a better medium-term balance into the market , would need to be based on detailed assessments of trends in world demand for , and supply of , each of the major commodities experiencing persistently of depressed prices , the related trends in world stocks , and the expected future price trends , so as to determine the need for supply management in particular cases .  
I , General legislative and institutional framework , para . 25 ) , one of the initial steps that should be taken by the Government in relation to a proposed infrastructure project is to conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 53 / 206 of 18 December 1998 , decided that a provision of $ 86,200,000 should be included for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved during the course of the biennium 2000-2001 .

As these receipts are expected to moderate , the surplus would narrow automatically in the coming fiscal year , but remain at a comfortable level .  
Meanwhile , fewer people ( 64 per cent ) expected the existing situation to improve or remain unchanged in the coming 12 months , compared with 82 per cent in September , although 70 per cent were satisfied with the present situation ( down from 81 per cent ) while fewer people , 72 per cent , said that they were confident Hong Kong would continue to be prosperous and stable ( down from 80 per cent ) .

For HOS Operating Account , an increase in income is projected for the 1999 / 2000 budget over the revised budget for 1998 / 99 .  However , an increase in expenditure from $ 7.2 billion in 1998 / 99 to $ 17.6 billion in 1999 / 2000 , due to a much higher number of HOS units completed in the coming year , is expected to cause the surplus level to drop by $ 5 billion to $ 10.1 billion .

In the race into the knowledge economy , Mr Tung expected that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as knowledge , brain power , or innovative human capital , was worth more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge economy . 
In view of the ever-increasing demand for A &amp; amp ; E service , HA has already introduced various measures to cope with the pressure on A &amp; amp ; E departments , including staggering the shift hours for medical and nursing staff to better match the arrival patterns of patients at peak attendance hours ; deploying additional medical staff at A &amp; amp ; E departments to work on anticipated busy sessions ; informing " non-urgent " patients of their expected waiting time so that they may consider other alternative treatment options .  
It was reported that , owing to insufficient sewage treatment capacity , the Shatin Sewage Treatment Works has been intermittently discharging sewage with pollutants level exceeding the stipulated permissible limits ( " sub-standard sewage " ) since 1996 , resulting in the deterioration of the water quality of the Victoria Harbour . To address the problem , the Administration planned to expand the Treatment Works and Phase I of the project was expected to be completed in 4 years ' time .  
Mr Wong noted that the Government had set aside a sum of $ 800 million for the implementation of the education reform , enabling an early start on those recommendations of the Education Commission that the Government and the community consider to warrant priority action .  At the same time , the Government expected the public , particularly the beneficiary of the fruits of education , to shoulder a greater share of the substantial additional cost involved in the implementation of the agreed reform package .  
There is no doubt that economic recovery in the region has gathered considerable momentum .  Economic growth for most economies has been better than expected , external balances have improved remarkably , international funds have renewed interest in the region 's asset markets , and yield spreads of Asian sovereign bond issues over the US treasuries have narrowed notably .  
" I have no doubt that the long term goal of the community of Hong Kong is to have a stable political structure providing a constructive and workable relationship between our executive-led government and a legislature elected through universal suffrage .  Many stakeholders are involved .  The administration will be expected to take a lead in coming up with alternative proposals .

Having examined the programme structure , design and content of individual courses , teaching and learning materials , the modes of teaching , the assessment methods , and other relevant aspects of course delivery , the HKCAA has concluded that the Springboard programme , in totality , can appropriately prepare students with a general level of knowledge and skills for employment purpose , which is comparable to the level of knowledge and skill expected of a graduate with five HKCEE passes .  
Of the 311 slopes and retaining walls inspected , none had signs of immediate danger .  The current maintenance condition of 293 slopes is satisfactory .  Of the remaining 18 slopes , which are either located in remote areas or minor ones , maintenance works are either in progress or are being arranged .  These works , which are mainly clearance of channels and repair of damaged or eroded surfaces , are expected to be completed in the next few months .  
The starting point will be to look at the core competencies expected of our senior officers and draw up a specific and focused plan to update their knowledge and upgrade their potential to meet the challenges ahead .

Some 3 000 overseas companies have established their regional headquarters or offices in Hong Kong . Two years ago we attracted the second highest amount of external direct investment in Asia , just behind the Mainland and far exceeding other places in Asia . That figure increased more than 1.5 times last year .  China 's accession to the World Trade Organisation is expected to add impetus to this momentum .  
Nevertheless , when compared with some other economies in the region , our economic structure is relatively stable .  Our export trade and inward investment have been developed in a relatively balanced and diversified manner .  On top of these , the Mainland of China is the only economy in the region that is expected to sustain a rapid economic growth .  Its accession to the WTO will create abundant business opportunities for Hong Kong .

By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .  
Members welcomed the plan and advised that effort should be made to secure persons at senior management level in the selected respondent firms for interview since they should have better grasp of expected changes in business performance than staff at middle rank .  
As the top echelon of the Government , the new principal officials are expected to lead and contribute towards the building up of an efficient , professional , fair , clean and honest civil service .  
In parallel , we shall issue a composite Civil Service Circular to ensure that all colleagues in the civil service clearly understand their role and responsibilities in relation to the new principal officials .  This circular will set out the framework within which civil servants are to work to the principal officials .  In particular , it will enunciate the core values and high standard of probity that civil servants are expected to uphold in discharging their official duties , including the following :  
The GN sets out the minimum standard of corporate governance that is expected of an authorized insurer .  It provides for , amongst others , the structure of the senior management , the role and responsibilities of the Board of Directors , the establishment of specialized committees , internal controls and compliance with laws and regulations .  
Turning to the regulation of Chinese medicines , Dr Chan said that the CMC was drafting three sets of subsidiary legislations , including detailed regulatory arrangements , disciplinary procedures of Chinese medicine traders and categories and levels of fees .  These legislations are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council within this Legco year .  Upon enactment of the subsidiary legislations , the licensing system for Chinese medicine traders will be implemented in the first half of next year , followed by the registration of proprietary Chinese medicines .  
If you look back objectively and separate out the expected opposing and strident statements by the staff unions , you will discover , by and large , that civil servants have handled all these challenges remarkably well .  They have quietly but surely demonstrated a genuine desire and commitment to serve the community to the best of their abilities and within the available resources .  
Overall investment spending in the economy , as represented by gross domestic fixed capital formation , is now expected to decline by 4.1% in real terms in 2002 , up from the earlier forecast of a 4.8% fall .  
( b ) As compared with the forecast made early this year , the foundation remedial works for Block L of Tin Chung Court are expected to experience a slight slippage of three months .  This is due to geological complexities and congested work areas , which necessitate extra caution in work processes .  Moreover , additional care has to be exercised to minimize adverse impact on residents of nearby blocks all of which have been occupied .  The monitoring process and works schedule have therefore been longer than expected .  
Mr Jackson said that Hong Kong people expected to have the world 's freest economy ( a ranking that was reaffirmed by the Cato Institute this week ) , the lowest crime and corruption rates in the region , the busiest container port , the most popular international airport , the busiest air-cargo hub , the most independent judiciary , the strongest legal system , and the widest guaranteed freedoms .  
" Bacterial food poisoning is expected to rise , " he said .  " The major contributing factors in food poisoning are cross-contamination between raw food and cooked food , as well as inadequate cooking .  Dr Tsang said the incidence of acute conjunctivitis was low in the first half of this year .  
Last year exported Taiwan canned pineapple totaled 1,300,000 cartons , valued at about US $ 13,600,000 . The Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in the Republic of China is sponsoring species improvement . This includes such research work as seed selection , introduction of new varieties , cross breeding , tissue culture and quality analysis to prevent pests and diseases . It also seeks increased productivity and improved quality . Taiwan pineapple s in different export items are expected to play an increasingly important role in international markets .  
Work on the plan , supported by a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development , got under way in July 1984 and is expected to take six years to complete . The ultimate goal is to store the complete text of China 's 25 traditional dynastic histories , around 60 million Chinese characters , onto one thin computer disk , enabling researchers to search , index , and analyze the material by software commands .  
Similarly , we forecast only 7.5% growth at the end of 1987 ; our growth rate should have increased with the global recovery , but the NT dollar appreciated faster than expected , leading to negative growth in exports to the U . S . , so the real growth rate of 7.33% was worse than anticipated .  
In the space of a year 19 sites with prehistoric relics were discovered . A location at Wangwei stream two kilometers north of the Chuping tribe of the Bunung aboriginal people of Wanfeng was selected . The place is called Qais in Bunung , meaning " the territorial limit . " A search was tried , turning up artifacts as expected .  
Next morning many customers visiting bakeries were surprised to discover the bill came to NT $ 1 more than expected , as bread prices had quietly risen overnight . In the evening when they went to the night market for a bowl of oyster noodles they found new prices written on red paper had unaccountably been stuck over the plastic price boards .  
Modern Taiwan 's rural hinterland could hardly be expected to provide ethical regeneration and social harmony as it used to in the past , because concentration of the population in cities is already an established trend . But rural culture 's essential spiritual values can provide the basis for cultural development .  
Just ten years ago research into computer " artificial intelligence " was being abandoned as computer researchers around the world were stymied in getting computers to understand models of human thought . Now Chu , who holds boundless enthusiasm for Chinese-language computers , has declared that he has designed " an intelligent Chinese computer " that " can think , learn skills and communicate directly with people using language . " The first stages of its development have already been completed successfully , and it is expected to be formally unveiled within two years . "  
The amount and scale of temple festivals today and the number of believers taking part is very unlike what happened during the " modern scientism " of the 1960s and ' 70s , when people expected there to be no trace of them in the metropolis and hardly anything in the countryside . On the contrary , pilgrimages , foundation services , festivals and religious activities to ward off disasters have all been encouraged by officials and public alike , so that there is now a flourishing in both cities and villages .  
On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
And , as expected , the writer makes a preliminary sketch in the section on the modern theory of life and death . He makes six suggestions , advising us to combine a coherent and simple concept of death with a pluralized and tolerant modern mind ; to combine scientific rationality and philosophical rationality as the methodological key ; and to distinguish between su-ti ( mundane experience ) and chen-ti ( true understanding ) on the basis of Buddhist teachings , finally reaching the highest level of meaning by climbing upward level by level .  
Because economic activity was more vigorous at the beginning of 1994 than had been expected , many international economic institutions revised their mid-year estimates of total growth for 1994 upward , yet " actual growth was higher than even the revised estimates . "  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
Developing countries can not be expected to have the depth of accumulated research of say , the data going back 100 years on average for every trout and salmon species in Europe and America , or one rare British species of lycaenid butterfly which has been researched for thirty or forty years , or researchers in the mold of the British entomologist R.H.L . Disney , who has spent 25 years completing over 100 papers about " scuttle flies , " which most people have never even heard of .  
Ma Kai suggests that one reason for the current rise in frictional unemployment is that , now that Taiwan is wealthy , far fewer young people need to be so careful about hanging on to an " iron rice bowl " ( as secure jobs are called by Chinese ) . In addition , the implementation of national health insurance means that job-seekers have one major worry off their minds . It was thus only to be expected that frictional unemployment has risen rapidly .  
Since the 1980s , when US researchers confirmed that taxol ( derived from the Pacific yew , Taxus brevifolia , which belongs to the same genus as the Taiwan yew , Taxus mairei ) is effective in treating ovarian and breast cancers , clinical trials have been conducted or are planned to test the drug against more than 60 types of tumor . As more and more suitable applications are discovered , the demand for taxol is expected only to rise .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
Although the surveyors were very hesitant to reopen the dispute , in order to complete their duties as civil servants they just put their heads down and plowed ahead , notifying the two to come out and identify their boundary . As expected , each of the two had his own version . But at least now there was a formal record that could be taken to a mediation committee for a compromise solution , thus allowing the surveyors to get through this risky " mission impossible . "  
Before returning to Taiwan , Lien Chan 's delegation , as expected , went to another European nation on a mission of " academic diplomacy . " This time Lien went to historic Trinity College Dublin , where he spoke with Provost Tom Mitchell about increasing academic exchange between the two nations . Somewhat earlier , a former vice president of Ireland paid him a short visit .  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
He says that Taiwan must offer the US a persuasive alternative to the PRC 's definition of the situation . He criticizes the current line of ROC policy-that there is one China , and Taiwan is part of China , but that for the time being the two sides are divided and should be considered political entities of equal status . " Even people in Taiwan are confused , so how can foreigners be expected to understand ? " he asks .  
In the 1992 production Dance Over the Universe , Kuang Huan 's secret weapon-baby oil-appeared for the first time . As expected , it made an eye-catching spectacle-dancers with shaved heads , bodies nearly naked so they can slide freely ; with the baby oil as a catalyst , linear motions become scarce and are replaced by continuous sliding , twisting and rolling .  
According to Liu , the new US-Japanese guidelines can be seen as an example of " soft containment " by a maritime power against a continental power . It is very worthy of note , in this regard , that the PRC-which has , under Jiang Zemin , repaired relations with the US-responded much less angrily than was expected to the revised guidelines . Indeed the PRC has continued to move forward actively in relations with the US .  
A year ago , when SET established its news department with a focus on what is termed " community news " ( meaning crime , sex and other sensational topics ) , it originally expected to lose about NT $ 5 million a month . Now , a year later , they have discovered that they have actually been making money , and they have decided to turn into an all-news station , adding staff in anticipation of the media wars that are sure to erupt during the presidential election campaigns .  
All foster parents receive basic training and understand that abused children are different from other children . Nevertheless , as one foster mother put it , " Until you 've actually been through it , you just ca n't imagine how tough it is . " For most prospective foster parents , the task that lies ahead will be more difficult than expected .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
She said that she never expected that her party membership would be revoked . The astonishing cross-partisan pairings of the Soong-Chang and Hsu-Chu tickets-both presidential candidates stepping outside party ranks to launch independent campaigns and choosing running mates completely different from themselves-on the one hand shows that they are above not only party politics , but also provincial background and the issue of unification vs . independence . On the other hand , it also shows that they hoped to maximize the complementarity of their tickets to attract votes from as wide a political spectrum as possible .  
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr . Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter . He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty . You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful . A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
It involves eighteen countries , headed by the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France and mainland China . The project was originally scheduled for completion in 2005 , but intense competition from a privately owned gene-sequencing company , Celera Genomics , spurred the multinational team to bring forward its timetable , and a full , precise map of the human genome is now expected before 2003 .  
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 . They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . " She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success . Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .  
The famous Tang dynasty physician Sun Simao spent huge sums of money to learn spells and charms from various sources . He admitted that these occult techniques were not especially desirable or palatable , nor did they have a compelling logic behind them , but , he added , they had proved more effective than he expected , and that is why he included them in his medical text Qian Jin Yi Fang .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
Third - and fourth-year elementary school pupils are expected to master some 30 defined skills in social studies , including the abilities to " describe the lifestyles of people in different regions , " " survey the distribution of and changes in the population of their home area , " and " recognize that the formation of a settlement is a response to the human need for communal living . "  
But performers who are used to singing in the restrained , thin falsetto of Peking Opera can not be expected to open their throats and produce a powerful voice , capable of reaching out over the orchestra and into the ears of the audience , without comprehensive prior training .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life . Traveling only to see the scenery , he incidentally discovered that major pharmaceuticals manufacturers from around the world had set up shop in the PRC , hoping to find buried treasure . That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
A year earlier , during the celebration of their anniversary in 1999 , they sold models of Taiwan 's earliest locomotive , the Tengyun , " Cloud Rider , " with the words " Remembering our Trains " carved on them . These models were a 1000-unit limited edition , with each selling for NT $ 35,000 ; no-one expected they would sell out in the space of a day-even the TRA were blown away .  
It is expected that interactive services will change the public 's passive TV viewing habits , shifting them toward active choice and control over viewing times . They are also likely to allow audiences to pay for programming according to what they wish to watch . However , the key to success is that the content delivered must be varied and extensive .  
The most exciting game was that against Japan , which went into extra innings , with Chinese Taipei being clipped by only a single run . Head coach Hsu Sheng-ming said that although the team lost , no one had even expected it to give Japan much of a fight , so their efforts both at the plate and in the field were very admirable . Star pitcher Tsao Chin-hui threw until his hand blistered and began bleeding , giving an idea of the determination shown by the whole squad .  
Eddington , the airline 's chief executive , said : " The airline market is expected to remain weak but the quick and decisive actions we have taken have shown we are determined to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability . "  
according to experts , the satellite launched today is expected to fly in space for half a month in addition to scientific surveys , it also carries technical experimental devices for plant and animal micro cells and industrial micro gravity

A number of delegations addressed the issue of the continued growth of foreign direct investment in the world economy in the context of expected recovery in world economic performance and growth and continuing structural changes in the world economy .  
In the medium term , this decline in the construction sector can be expected to be reversed given the potential for industrial restructuring , the need for extensive infrastructure investment , and the social pressures for a renewal of the housing stock .  
While national efforts are the key to a successful export strategy , bilateral and multilateral support , including longterm capital , should make a major difference in reducing the period required to achieve the expected results . 
While distinct , small units coordinate those preparations , the respective divisions are expected to provide the main substantive backstopping for those processes and are headed by the same senior staff who supervise the units .  
The experiences at Gorazde and Bihac provide stark evidence that in the absence of consent and cooperation , the " light option " , adopted as an initial measure and supported by air power alone , can not be expected to be effective in protecting the safe areas .  
Two additional manuals , one on public and official use for civil registration and vital statistics records and another on population , education and communication for civil registration , are being planned and are expected to be completed in 1996 .

All designated depository libraries are expected to place the material received in the care of qualified library staff , to keep it in good order and to make it accessible to the public , free of charge , at reasonable hours .  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .  
For a regime that has initiated and coordinated the war and ethnic cleansing against our Republic ( I call your attention here to the New York Times article of 13 April 1995 , citing internal documents of the Serbian secret police as evidence of Belgrade 's promotion of acts that constitute violations of humanitarian law and of the Genocide Convention , and which constitute aggression ) , formal recognition is the minimal step to be expected .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
A monthly equipment reimbursement rate used with the wet / dry lease system which is the generic fair market value divided by the equipment 's expected useful life expressed in months plus a factor for attrition for wear and tear ; or the replacement value divided by the equipment 's expected useful life expressed in months , whichever is less . 
National participating organizations would be expected to constitute teams of qualified volunteers ( perhaps focusing on a limited number of areas of coverage identified by each organization ) , assure their specialized training and facilitate the rapid deployment and integration of such teams , including the building of linkages with local non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in the receiving countries .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
No country could be expected to stand idle when its own territorial integrity is incessantly threatened by blatant cross-border attacks of a terrorist organization based and operating from a neighbouring country , if that country is unable to put an end to such attacks .  
Those results will then need to be integrated into a clear set of conclusions and policy recommendations for advancing international understanding and consensus on forest issues : on that basis , the Panel is expected to propose coherent approaches to addressing the problem of the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests .  
Four months after the Mission took over from the multinational force , the Secretary-General stated in his report dated 24 July 1995-3 / that UNMIH had made significant progress towards achieving the goals adopted in resolution 940 ( 1994 ) and it was expected that it would be able to maintain a secure and stable environment throughout the current election period and the forthcoming presidential elections .  
Regarding protection of the marine environment , the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities , expected to be adopted at an intergovernmental conference on the subject to be held in Washington , D.C . , from 23 October to 3 November 1995 , would contribute to the effective implementation of relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and various regional maritime conventions and protocols .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
[ 1 ] These demographic trends are expected to be reinforced by negative economic trends : even if global wealth grows , it is expected to further widen the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries . 
In the Code of Conduct , the collective membership of SACB also agreed that international assistance to Somalia is founded on the basic principle that responsibility for its effective execution shall remain with the Somali people and that responsible Somali authorities are therefore expected to assume their proper role to ensure that conditions exist for the effective implementation of aid activities .

Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals to address any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situations of African countries ;  
In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
On a global scale , climate change is expected to cause wide variations in crop yields and productivity across regions and among localities , even though existing studies show that , on the whole , global agricultural production could be maintained at doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions .  
Parties to the Protocol on Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs ) , not yet in force , are also expected , as a second step , to negotiate further measures to reduce VOC emissions or their transboundary fluxes and their resulting secondary photochemical oxidant products , taking into account , inter alia , the best available scientific and technological developments , scientifically determined critical levels and internationally accepted target levels , as well as the role of nitrogen oxides in the formation of photochemical oxidants .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
Prices of internationally traded goods ( measured in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) ) are expected to change only marginally over the short term , as productivity increases , trade is further liberalized and competitive forces ( including in commodity markets ) contribute to keep global inflationary pressures at bay .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the Ad Hoc Committee estimates of the projected resource requirements from all sources , public and private , domestic and international , needed for the full implementation of the New Agenda , the amount expected to be mobilized and proposals for filling any resource gaps , taking into account the specific economic and development situation of African countries ;  
The information furnished contained general data on the trajectory of the planned flight of the shuttle above a specific swathe of eastern regions of the USSR and indicated the period of time during which the craft was expected to be located above the territory of the Soviet Union during its descent from orbit , its minimum flight altitude in that airspace before its entry into the Earth 's atmosphere above open sea , and technical details of the craft 's state .  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
Host Governments are expected to provide stable and transparent regulatory and fiscal environments including supportive administrative frameworks while at the same time providing acceptable socio-economic environments .  
In view of the pattern of meetings and conference-servicing requirements in 1994-1995 , it is expected that any requirements of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that can not be absorbed from within permanent capacity would require an additional appropriation and could not be met from within the reduced budgeted resources for temporary assistance in the approved programme budget for 1996-1997 .  
It is also expected that regional follow-up will be discussed during the consultative meetings of the regional representatives of ACC members , following the initiative of the Secretary-General , who has requested the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to convene such meetings in order to facilitate a dialogue on the requirements and conditions for improved coordination at the regional level .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .

The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .  Such harmonization should , however , be treated as a longer-term objective .  
These populations can not be expected to return to their homes if the political systems and national laws to which they are subject fail to offer them reliable guarantees against summary executions , enforced disappearances , torture and unfair trials .  
I should like to mention by way of example the return of UNITA members to the National Assembly , which they left in 1992 ; the return of the expected total number of general officers to the Angolan Armed Forces ; the completion of the selection process of a total 26,300 UNITA military troops for induction into the Angolan Armed Forces ; the re-establishment of government administration , given the continued illegal occupation of certain areas of the national territory ; and the free circulation of goods and people in the areas under its control .

Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
The oversight role of the General Assembly , as stressed in resolution 49 / 28 , may be expected to assume yet greater significance with universal acceptance of the Convention and be further consolidated by the addition of the new law of the sea institutions to the wider group of international organizations responsible in various specialized aspects of ocean affairs , whose competence therein is affirmed and further reinforced by the Convention . 
Bangladesh strongly felt that the independent status of major information centres should be maintained and where necessary restored , and expected the Department of Public Information to take urgent action in respect of the Centre in Dhaka and nominate a director for the Centre . 89 .  Bangladesh attached the highest priority to freedom of speech and the media , in the belief that democracy , development and peace were integrally related and that the free flow of information was an essential component of democracy .  
For that period the General Assembly had appropriated a total amount of $ 11,948,718 gross and the actual expenditure had been $ 9,978,000 gross : the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross had resulted from a number of factors , in particular the release of fixed-wing aircraft earlier than had been anticipated , and savings on civilian personnel costs owing mainly to the fact that the vacancy rate had been higher than expected . 
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
Secondly , the Board had to undertake important managerial tasks essential to the future efficient functioning of UNCTAD , on which the Union expected detailed discussions in such areas as UNCTAD 's technical cooperation activities and UNCTAD 's publications policy .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .  
Although the final account on the construction at ESCAP was to have been submitted to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session , as reported in document A / C . 5 / 50 / 17 , it was expected that there would be additional charges against the project for minor retrofit of main vehicular entrance , final finishes and so on before the exact total project cost could be known .  
In other cases , however , the joint pursuit of these goals has proved more difficult than expected , at times contributing to political instability , social disarray and economic disappointment .  
Upon enquiry , however , the Advisory Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .

Authorities there relied on tight monetary policy to secure the continued reduction in inflation , while fiscal policy is now expected to turn more restrictive , in part pending adoption of legislation by the Congress . This is regarded as essential to consolidating the stabilization plan and reaching the target of single-digit inflation , although as noted above it comes at a high social cost in the short run .  
When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .

In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe , owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure , and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
Taking into consideration the overall needs of the country , the expected core resources of the United Nations agencies and the unique operating environment , the United Nations , together with non-governmental organizations spent the latter half of 1996 developing a joint strategy for efficient and targeted assistance in four main areas : emergencies , reintegration , rehabilitation and governance .  
Given the high level of technical sophistication that might be expected from certification authorities and the high level of trust they were intended to generate , certification authorities should , in normal circumstances , be held liable whenever the issuance of faulty certificates resulted in damages .  
Price is a major factor affecting the efficient use of energy ; as long as energy from different sources is not priced at its full cost , inclusive of the environmental damage it causes , there is no possibility of meeting the energy needs of the existing global population , let alone the needs of the expected increased population .  
He agreed that periodic reviews of the Model Law would be desirable because of the particular nature of the subject matter and the rapid technical changes that could be expected ; for that same reason it would also be useful for the current text to be described as the " 1996 version " of the Model Law .  
Although dependence on imported oil and coal for total energy requirements is not expected to be reduced , natural gas is anticipated to have an increasing role in electricity production and in the residential heating market .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
In situations where the constraints on domestic resources are most severe owing to weak economic performance , inadequate infrastructure and the shortage of trained personnel , it is expected that most of the needed resources will be supplied through external population assistance .

The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .

The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
Our own position , as presented to the Council in the open debate that took place on 21 May under the presidency of the Republic of Korea , can be summarized as follows : if the Security Council is to be expected to play a more active role in guaranteeing safe conditions for humanitarian assistance , our preference is for such endeavours to be attempted in parallel with multilaterally defined diplomatic agendas and within the realm of the possibilities offered by Chapter VI that of the pacific settlement of disputes .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
In Japan , the urgent need to reduce fiscal deficits , given the sharp increase in public debt and the future obligations of the Government to finance burgeoning social security payments , is likely to prevent the fiscal authorities from adopting any new major measures to stimulate demand ; but , even if the Government were to attempt to stimulate demand , the long-term effects of public spending increases would not be expected to be high .  
Trying to evade the cut _ off negotiations , which constitute an essential stage , would mean remaining at the stage of declamatory phrases or placing oneself in the final perspective of nuclear disarmament in the framework of general and complete disarmament : in either case , no concrete progress can be expected in the near future .  
In the context which I have just outlined , my country believes that the best chance we have here today to begin work which can produce rapid and concrete results which are understandable and expected by the entire international community lies in establishing as soon as possible an ad hoc committee to negotiate a comprehensive ban on anti _ personnel mines by means of a step _ by _ step approach .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
It is also expected that the Secretariat will inform the Security Council , in accordance with operative paragraph 13 of Council resolution 1076 ( 1996 ) of 22 October 1996 , about the political , military and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan , which will obviously include the recent ethnic cleansing by the Taliban , which has been widely reported and witnessed by impartial observers and the international mass media .  
At its fifty _ second session the Commission on Human Rights decided , without a vote , that all continuing thematic or country _ oriented mandates established by the Commission and entrusted to special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups are expected to report to the fifty _ third session ( decision 1996 / 113 ) .  
The recent statement of Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterating Israel 's absolute sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the Jewish people which will never again be divided typifies the uncompromising and brazen attitude of the present Israeli leadership , not the statesmanship that would have been more appropriate , and that is expected of it in the current delicate situation .  
The force would perform such duties as accompanying humanitarian convoys , protecting international humanitarian personnel , protecting some key ports or airports where humanitarian goods are expected to enter Albania , guarding depots and other places where humanitarian goods are kept , and securing safe corridors for humanitarian convoys on parts of national roads .  
Furthermore , my Office 's overall efforts towards the economic reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina , functioning common institutions and the improvement of the overall human rights , policing and judicial situation can be expected to have beneficial effects for the provision of durable solutions for displaced persons and returning refugees .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , that unless otherwise indicated in the resolutions adopted at the fifty _ third session , all special rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups entrusted with continuing thematic or country-oriented mandates established by the Commission were expected to report to the fifty-fourth session , even if the relevant resolutions did not make explicit reference to that reporting obligation .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .
