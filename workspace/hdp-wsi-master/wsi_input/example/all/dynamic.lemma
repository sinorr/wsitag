In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
Competition authorities could make a key contribution in the formulation and implementation of economic policies by ( a ) expressing their views relating to policies or measures that restrict competition , and advising on how legitimate economic goals might be attained through less competition _ restricting measures ; and ( b ) combining effective enforcement against RBPs with an economically realistic approach to cooperation and concentration and a dynamic assessment of markets .  
In economic terms , the two main types of efficiency promoted by competition are static efficiency ( optimum utilization of existing resources at least cost ) and dynamic efficiency ( optimal introduction of new products , more efficient production processes and superior organizational structures over time ) .  
Peace needs to be considered , not as the absence of differences and conflicts , but as a positive , dynamic , participatory process linked intrinsically to democracy , justice and development for all by which differences are respected , dialogue is encouraged and conflicts are constantly transformed by non-violent means into new avenues of understanding and cooperation .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
The ability of the domestic industries of weak economies to respond to competition is impeded by inefficiencies which are due to inappropriate technology , obsolete equipment , inadequate infrastructure and support services , and previously excessive levels of protection .  Although in due course import liberalization will have dynamic positive effects on growth and employment , in the short run there is a risk of the failure of inefficient domestic firms , with the attendant social costs if workers lose their jobs and can not shift immediately to produce static efficiency gains from more productive employment elsewhere .

The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
The continuing Asian crisis , which was taking place in countries considered to have dynamic economies based on sound fundamental macroeconomic variables , had clearly shown that macroeconomic stability could not by itself ensure the level of stability that a sustained development-oriented industrial strategy required .  
Based on past experience and the changes brought about by the rapid globalization of the economy , there had been a growing convergence of policies that encouraged investment in human resources and government responsibility in creating a dynamic domestic framework in which the private sector could play its role as the driving force of industrial development .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
That the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and particularly economic , social and cultural rights , is a dynamic process and that , as is evident in today 's world , a great deal remains to be accomplished ;

Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .

The region can no longer rely on cheap labour or raw materials for its structural transformation but rather must shift to improving the productivity of its labour , effectively transforming its static comparative advantages to dynamic competitive advantages .  
The dynamic of todays world is an unavoidable challenge demanding not only domestic democratic cooperation , but also negotiations that will raise countries to a level of development at which they can work with other regional and multilateral partners .

Mr . Leiro ( Norway ) said that the assumption that globalization benefited everyone had yet to be proven ; the gap between rich and poor was growing both within and between nations and many poor countries attracted minimal foreign investment , lacked a dynamic private sector and were often deprived of the benefits of increased export earnings by heavy debt burdens and limited market access .
